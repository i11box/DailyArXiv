| **[Bias Unveiled: Investigating Social Bias in LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10351v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in evaluating social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several prompting strategies for mitigating bias, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and dialogue with Solar. Our experiments show that dialogue with Solar can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Last, we make the code and data publicly available is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Motion by Queries: Identity-Motion Trade-offs in Text-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07750v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in generating coherent video clips from textual descriptions. However, the interplay between motion, structure, and identity representations in these models remains under-explored. Here, we investigate how self-attention query features (a.k.a. Q features) simultaneously govern motion, structure, and identity and examine the challenges arising when these representations interact. Our analysis reveals that Q affects not only layout, but that during denoising Q also has a strong effect on subject identity, making it hard to transfer motion without the side-effect of transferring identity. Understanding this dual role enabled us to control query feature injection (Q injection) and demonstrate two applications: (1) a zero-shot motion transfer method that is 20 times more efficient than existing approaches, and (2) a training-free technique for consistent multi-shot video generation, where characters maintain identity across multiple video shots while Q injection enhances motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>(1) P...</summary><p>(1) Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/par/MotionByQueries/ (2) The methods and results in section 5, "Consistent multi-shot video generation", are based on the arXiv version 1 (v1) of this work.

| **[Understanding the Limits of Lifelong Knowledge Editing in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05683v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keeping large language models factually up-to-date is crucial for deployment, yet costly retraining remains a challenge. Knowledge editing offers a promising alternative, but methods are only tested on small-scale or synthetic edit benchmarks. In this work, we aim to bridge research into lifelong knowledge editing to real-world edits at practically relevant scale. We first introduce WikiBigEdit; a large-scale benchmark of real-world Wikidata edits, built to automatically extend lifelong for future-proof benchmarking. In its first instance, it includes over 500K question-answer pairs for knowledge editing alongside a comprehensive evaluation pipeline. Finally, we use WikiBigEdit to study existing knowledge editing techniques' ability to incorporate large volumes of real-world facts and contrast their capabilities to generic modification techniques such as retrieval augmentation and continual finetuning to acquire a complete picture of the practical extent of current lifelong knowledge editing.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A comparison of the Alkire-Foster method and a Markov random field approach in the analysis of multidimensional poverty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05676v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multidimensional poverty measurement is crucial for capturing deprivation beyond income-based metrics. This study compares the Alkire-Foster (AF) method and a Markov Random Field (MRF) approach for classifying multidimensional poverty using a simulation-based analysis. The AF method applies a deterministic threshold-based classification, while the MRF approach leverages probabilistic graphical modelling to account for correlations between deprivation indicators. Using a synthetic dataset of 50,000 individuals with ten binary deprivation indicators, we assess classification accuracy, false positive/negative trade-offs, and agreement between the methods. Results show that AF achieves higher classification accuracy (89.5%) compared to MRF (75.4%), with AF minimizing false negatives and MRF reducing false positives. The overall agreement between the two methods is 65%, with discrepancies primarily occurring when AF classifies individuals as poor while MRF does not. While AF is transparent and easy to implement, it does not capture interdependencies among indicators, potentially leading to misclassification. MRF, though computationally intensive, offers a more nuanced understanding of deprivation clusters. These findings highlight the trade-offs in multidimensional poverty measurement and provide insights for policymakers on method selection based on data availability and policy objectives. Future research should extend these approaches to non-binary indicators and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Algorithmic Data Minimization for Machine Learning over Internet-of-Things Data Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05675v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning can analyze vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices to identify patterns, make predictions, and enable real-time decision-making. By processing sensor data, machine learning models can optimize processes, improve efficiency, and enhance personalized user experiences in smart systems. However, IoT systems are often deployed in sensitive environments such as households and offices, where they may inadvertently expose identifiable information, including location, habits, and personal identifiers. This raises significant privacy concerns, necessitating the application of data minimization -- a foundational principle in emerging data regulations, which mandates that service providers only collect data that is directly relevant and necessary for a specified purpose. Despite its importance, data minimization lacks a precise technical definition in the context of sensor data, where collections of weak signals make it challenging to apply a binary "relevant and necessary" rule. This paper provides a technical interpretation of data minimization in the context of sensor streams, explores practical methods for implementation, and addresses the challenges involved. Through our approach, we demonstrate that our framework can reduce user identifiability by up to 16.7% while maintaining accuracy loss below 1%, offering a viable path toward privacy-preserving IoT data processing.</p></details> | 9 pages, 18 figures |

The concept of variable importance and Shapley values are interpretability measures that applies to any predictive model and assesses how much a variable or set of variables improves prediction performance. When the number of variables is large, estimating variable importance presents a significant computational challenge because re-training neural networks or other black-box algorithms requires significant additional computation. In this paper, we address this challenge for algorithms using gradient descent and gradient boosting (e.g. neural networks, gradient-boosted decision trees). By using the ideas of early stopping of gradient-based methods in combination with warm-start using the dropout method, we develop a scalable method to estimate variable importance for any algorithm that can be expressed as an iterative kernel update equation. Importantly, we provide theoretical guarantees by using the theory for early stopping of kernel-based methods for neural networks with sufficiently large (but not necessarily infinite) width and gradient-boosting decision trees that use symmetric trees as a weaker learner. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our methods through simulations and a real data example which illustrates the computational benefit of early stopping rather than fully re-training the model as well as the increased accuracy of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version accepted in AISTATS, 2025</p></details> |
| **[DeltaProduct: Increasing the Expressivity of DeltaNet Through Products of Householders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10297v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |
| **[Kinodynamic Model Predictive Control for Energy Efficient Locomotion of Legged Robots with Parallel Elasticity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05666v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a kinodynamic model predictive control (MPC) framework that exploits unidirectional parallel springs (UPS) to improve the energy efficiency of dynamic legged robots. The proposed method employs a hierarchical control structure, where the solution of MPC with simplified dynamic models is used to warm-start the kinodynamic MPC, which accounts for nonlinear centroidal dynamics and kinematic constraints. The proposed approach enables energy efficient dynamic hopping on legged robots by using UPS to reduce peak motor torques and energy consumption during stance phases. Simulation results demonstrated a 38.8% reduction in the cost of transport (CoT) for a monoped robot equipped with UPS during high-speed hopping. Additionally, preliminary hardware experiments show a 14.8% reduction in energy consumption.

| **[AIM-Fair: Advancing Algorithmic Fairness via Selectively Fine-Tuning Biased Models with Contextual Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05665v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model fairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality of synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models, and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves model fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and partially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025.

| **[NoT: Federated Unlearning via Weight Negation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05657v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated unlearning (FU) aims to remove a participant's data contributions from a trained federated learning (FL) model, ensuring privacy and regulatory compliance. Traditional FU methods often depend on auxiliary storage on either the client or server side or require direct access to the data targeted for removal-a dependency that may not be feasible if the data is no longer available. To overcome these limitations, we propose NoT, a novel and efficient FU algorithm based on weight negation (multiplying by -1), which circumvents the need for additional storage and access to the target data. We argue that effective and efficient unlearning can be achieved by perturbing model parameters away from the set of optimal parameters, yet being well-positioned for quick re-optimization. This technique, though seemingly contradictory, is theoretically grounded: we prove that the weight negation perturbation effectively disrupts inter-layer co-adaptation, inducing unlearning while preserving an approximate optimality property, thereby enabling rapid recovery. Experimental results across three datasets and three model architectures demonstrate that NoT significantly outperforms existing baselines in unlearning efficacy as well as in communication and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 42nd IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Nashville TN, US. 2025</p></details> |
| **[START: Self-taught Reasoner with Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04625v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks through the utilization of long Chain-of-thought (CoT). However, these models often suffer from hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal reasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner with Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly enhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code execution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking, exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the limitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning framework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate that inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python here is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively stimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any demonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective sequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and modifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM via Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we have fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA (GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the competition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates of 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively. It significantly outperforms the base QwQ-32B and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art open-weight model R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and the proprietary model o1-Preview.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 5 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05641v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://yxbian23.github.io/project/video-painter</p></details> |

By disentangling deterministic view transformations from stochastic content generation, our method achieves precise control over user-specified camera trajectories. We propose a novel dual-stream conditional video diffusion model that concurrently integrates point cloud renders and source videos as conditions, ensuring accurate view transformations and coherent 4D content generation. Instead of leveraging scarce multi-view videos, we curate a hybrid training dataset combining web-scale monocular videos with static multi-view datasets, by our innovative double-reprojection strategy, significantly fostering robust generalization across diverse scenes. Extensive evaluations on multi-view and large-scale monocular videos demonstrate the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://trajectorycrafter.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Strategy Coopetition Explains the Emergence and Transience of In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05631v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful ability that emerges in transformer models, enabling them to learn from context without weight updates. Recent work has established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes disappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that, after the disappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights and in-context learning, which we term "context-constrained in-weights learning" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually replaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL transience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually share sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For example, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only be enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL thus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term "strategy coopetition." We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key dynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

Accurate and efficient joint segmentation of point cloud from Panel to Tree and Branch (P2TB) is essential for robotic operations. However, most current segmentation methods focus on single instance segmentation and depend on a sequence of deep networks to perform joint tasks. This strategy hinders the use of hierarchical information embedded in the data, leading to both error accumulation and increased costs for annotation and computation, which limits its scalability for real-world applications. In this study, we proposed a novel approach that incorporated a Real2Sim L-TreeGen for training data generation and a joint model (J-P2TB) designed for the P2TB task. The J-P2TB model, trained on the generated simulation dataset, was used for joint segmentation of real-world panel point clouds via zero-shot learning. Compared to representative methods, our model outperformed them in most segmentation metrics while using 40% fewer learnable parameters. This Sim2Real result highlighted the efficacy of L-TreeGen in model training and the performance of J-P2TB for joint segmentation, demonstrating its strong accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability for real-world applications. These improvements would not only greatly benefit the development of robots for automated orchard operations but also advance digital twin technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Decision-aware training of spatiotemporal forecasting models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05622v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal allocation of scarce resources is a common problem for decision makers faced with choosing a limited number of locations for intervention. Spatiotemporal prediction models could make such decisions data-driven. A recent performance metric called fraction of best possible reach (BPR) measures the impact of using a model's recommended size K subset of sites compared to the best possible top-K in hindsight. We tackle two open problems related to BPR. First, we explore how to rank all sites numerically given a probabilistic model that predicts event counts jointly across sites. Ranking via the per-site mean is suboptimal for BPR. Instead, we offer a better ranking for BPR backed by decision theory. Second, we explore how to train a probabilistic model's parameters to maximize BPR. Discrete selection of K sites implies all-zero parameter gradients which prevent standard gradient training. We overcome this barrier via advances in perturbed optimizers. We further suggest a training objective that combines likelihood with a decision-aware BPR constraint to deliver high-quality top-K rankings as well as good forecasts for all sites. We demonstrate our approach on two where-to-intervene applications: mitigating opioid-related fatal overdoses for public health and monitoring endangered wildlife.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00242v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

In particular, query-based black-box attacks can generate malicious noise without having access to the victim model's architecture, making them practical in real-world contexts. The community has proposed several defenses against adversarial attacks, only to be broken by more advanced and adaptive attack strategies. In this paper, we propose a framework that detects if an adversarial noise instance is being generated. Unlike existing stateful defenses that detect adversarial noise generation by monitoring the input space, our approach learns adversarial patterns in the input update similarity space. In fact, we propose to observe a new metric called Delta Similarity (DS), which we show it captures more efficiently the adversarial behavior. We evaluate our approach against 8 state-of-the-art attacks, including adaptive attacks, where the adversary is aware of the defense and tries to evade detection. We find that our approach is significantly more robust than existing defenses both in terms of specificity and sensitivity.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, analyzing live dialogues in real-time necessitates low-latency processing systems, making it impractical to deploy models with billions of parameters due to latency constraints. As a result, practitioners often prefer smaller models with millions of parameters, trained on high-quality, human-annotated datasets. Yet, curating such datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to combine the scalability of LLM-generated labels with the precision of human annotations, enabling fine-tuned smaller models to achieve both higher speed and accuracy comparable to larger models. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective framework to address this challenge. Our approach is specifically designed for per-utterance classification problems, which encompass tasks such as intent detection, dialogue state tracking, and more. To mitigate the impact of labeling errors from LLMs -- the primary source of inaccuracies in student models -- we propose a noise-reduced preference learning loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves accuracy across utterance-level dialogue tasks, including sentiment detection (over $2\%$), dialogue act classification (over $1.5\%$), etc.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

This is especially true when dealing with complex robotic systems, such as those with dual arms employed for their improved payload capacity and manipulability. However, a key challenge is in expanding the robotic movements beyond the learned scenarios to adapt to minor and major variations from the specific demonstrations. In this work, we propose a learning and novel generalization approach that adapts the learned Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-parameterized policy derived from human demonstrations. Our method requires only a small number of human demonstrations and eliminates the need for a robotic system during the demonstration phase, which can significantly reduce both cost and time. The generalization process takes place directly in the parameter space, leveraging the lower-dimensional representation of GMM parameters. With only three parameters per Gaussian component, this process is computationally efficient and yields immediate results upon request. We validate our approach through real-world experiments involving a dual-arm robotic manipulation of boxes. Starting with just five demonstrations for a single task, our approach successfully generalizes to new unseen scenarios, including new target locations, orientations, and box sizes. These results highlight the practical applicability and scalability of our method for complex manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

To balance these trade-offs, we present Input-Convex Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (ICKANs) for learning polyconvex hyperelastic constitutive laws. ICKANs leverage the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation, decomposing the model into compositions of trainable univariate spline-based activation functions for rich expressivity. We introduce trainable input-convex splines within the KAN architecture, ensuring physically admissible polyconvex hyperelastic models. The resulting models are both compact and interpretable, enabling explicit extraction of analytical constitutive relationships through an input-convex symbolic regression techinque. Through unsupervised training on full-field strain data and limited global force measurements, ICKANs accurately capture nonlinear stress-strain behavior across diverse strain states. Finite element simulations of unseen geometries with trained ICKAN hyperelastic constitutive models confirm the framework's robustness and generalization capability.</p></details> | 34 pages, 15 figures |

Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a particularly promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive examination of SAEs as a promising approach to interpreting and understanding LLMs. We provide a systematic overview of SAE principles, architectures, and applications specifically tailored for LLM analysis, covering theoretical foundations, implementation strategies, and recent developments in sparsity mechanisms. We also explore how SAEs can be leveraged to explain the internal workings of LLMs, steer model behaviors in desired directions, and develop more transparent training methodologies for future models. Despite the challenges that remain around SAE implementation and scaling, they continue to provide valuable tools for understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |

This limitation can be attributed to the exponential concentration phenomenon, which can impair both trainability and generalization. A common strategy to alleviate this is bandwidth tuning, which involves rescaling data points in the quantum model to improve generalization. In this work, we numerically demonstrate that optimal bandwidth tuning results in QKs that closely resemble radial basis function (RBF) kernels, leading to a lack of quantum advantage over classical methods. Moreover, we reveal that the size of optimal bandwidth tuning parameters further simplifies QKs, causing them to behave like polynomial kernels, corresponding to a low-order Taylor approximation of a RBF kernel. We thoroughly investigate this for fidelity quantum kernels and projected quantum kernels using various data encoding circuits across several classification datasets. We provide numerical evidence and derive a simple analytical model that elucidates how bandwidth tuning influences key quantities in classification tasks. Overall, our findings shed light on the mechanisms that render QK methods classically simulatable.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages with 5 figures, and 9 appendix pages with 12 figures</p></details> |

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding, in particular in the context of depth perception. However, it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this, we examine whether the monocular depth cues, similar to those used by the human visual system, emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark, DepthCues, designed to evaluate depth cue understanding, and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models. Our analysis shows that human-like depth cues emerge in more recent larger models. We also explore enhancing depth perception in large vision models by fine-tuning on DepthCues, and find that even without dense depth supervision, this improves depth estimation. To support further research, our benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available for studying depth perception in vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

The dataset consists of 10,000 artificial patient records containing tabular variables (like symptoms, diagnoses and underlying conditions) and related notes describing the fictional patient encounter in the domain of respiratory diseases. The tabular portion of the data is generated through a Bayesian network, where both the causal structure between the variables and the conditional probabilities are proposed by an expert based on domain knowledge. We then prompt a large language model (GPT-4o) to generate a clinical note related to this patient encounter, describing the patient symptoms and additional context. We conduct both an expert evaluation study to assess the quality of the generated notes, as well as running some simple predictor models on both the tabular and text portions of the dataset, forming a baseline for further research. The SynSUM dataset is primarily designed to facilitate research on clinical information extraction in the presence of tabular background variables, which can be linked through domain knowledge to concepts of interest to be extracted from the text - the symptoms, in the case of SynSUM. Secondary uses include research on the automation of clinical reasoning over both tabular data and text, causal effect estimation in the presence of tabular and/or textual confounders, and multi-modal synthetic data generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/prabaey/synsum.

Despite the relevance of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely restricted model architectures or rely on energy-based training, which is prone to instability. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d.~samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations to physical lattice models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Poster at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Real-world time series datasets typically exhibit complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, RNN-based, CNN-based, Transformer-based, and hybrid models have been proposed. Unfortunately, current deep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of local features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking sufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory classification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale local patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent information in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex variable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract primary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic segments. Leveraging the inherent strengths of CNN and attention mechanism, we introduce the PeriodicBlock, which adaptively captures local patterns and global dependencies while offering enhanced interpretability through attention integration across different periodic scales. The experiments on UEA benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MPTSNet outperforms 21 existing advanced baselines in the MTSC tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in the camera coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative camera-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting.

Our BART Kernel (BARK) uses tree agreement to define a posterior over piecewise-constant functions, and we explore the space of tree kernels using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Where BART only samples functions, the resulting BARK model obtains samples of Gaussian processes defining distributions over functions, which allow us to build acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization. Our tree-based approach enables global optimization over the surrogate, even for mixed-feature spaces. Moreover, where many previous tree-based kernels provide uncertainty quantification over function values, our sampling scheme captures uncertainty over the tree structure itself. Our experiments show the strong performance of BARK on both synthetic and applied benchmarks, due to the combination of our fully Bayesian surrogate and the optimization procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 22 total pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Yet, existing solutions often rely on carefully crafted, task specific extrinsic rewards, limiting generalization to new tasks or environments. In this paper, we propose InDRiVE (Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration), a method that leverages purely intrinsic, disagreement based rewards within a Dreamer based MBRL framework. By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of purely intrinsic exploration for learning robust vehicle control behaviors, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IROS 2025 and is currently under review</p></details> |

Robotic Ultrasound Systems (RUSS) aim to address these limitations by providing standardized and automated imaging solutions, especially in environments with limited access to skilled operators. This paper presents the development of a novel RUSS system that employs dual RGB-D depth cameras to maintain the US probe normal to the skin surface, a critical factor for optimal image quality. Our RUSS integrates RGB-D camera data with robotic control algorithms to maintain orthogonal probe alignment on uneven surfaces without preoperative data. Validation tests using a phantom model demonstrate that the system achieves robust normal positioning accuracy while delivering ultrasound images comparable to those obtained through manual scanning. A-SEE2.0 demonstrates 2.47 ${\pm}$ 1.25 degrees error for flat surface normal-positioning and 12.19 ${\pm}$ 5.81 degrees normal estimation error on mannequin surface.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools for assisting in this task, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This study evaluates the fact-checking capabilities of various open-source LLMs, focusing on their ability to assess claims with different levels of contextual information. We conduct three key experiments: (1) evaluating whether LLMs can identify the semantic relationship between a claim and a fact-checking article, (2) assessing models' accuracy in verifying claims when given a related fact-checking article, and (3) testing LLMs' fact-checking abilities when leveraging data from external knowledge sources such as Google and Wikipedia. Our results indicate that LLMs perform well in identifying claim-article connections and verifying fact-checked stories but struggle with confirming factual news, where they are outperformed by traditional fine-tuned models such as RoBERTa. Additionally, the introduction of external knowledge does not significantly enhance LLMs' performance, calling for more tailored approaches. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automated fact-checking, emphasizing the need for further refinements before they can reliably replace human fact-checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main:...</summary><p>Main: 10 pages, 13 figures.

However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |

Despite these advances, existing methods, whether propagating unmasked region pixels through optical flow and receptive field priors, or extending image-inpainting models temporally, face challenges in generating fully masked objects or balancing the competing objectives of background context preservation and foreground generation in one model, respectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual-stream paradigm VideoPainter that incorporates an efficient context encoder (comprising only 6% of the backbone parameters) to process masked videos and inject backbone-aware background contextual cues to any pre-trained video DiT, producing semantically consistent content in a plug-and-play manner. This architectural separation significantly reduces the model's learning complexity while enabling nuanced integration of crucial background context. We also introduce a novel target region ID resampling technique that enables any-length video inpainting, greatly enhancing our practical applicability. Additionally, we establish a scalable dataset pipeline leveraging current vision understanding models, contributing VPData and VPBench to facilitate segmentation-based inpainting training and assessment, the largest video inpainting dataset and benchmark to date with over 390K diverse clips. Using inpainting as a pipeline basis, we also explore downstream applications including video editing and video editing pair data generation, demonstrating competitive performance and significant practical potential. Extensive experiments demonstrate VideoPainter's superior performance in both any-length video inpainting and editing, across eight key metrics, including video quality, mask region preservation, and textual coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://yxbian23.github.io/project/video-painter</p></details> |

Recent work has established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes disappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic understanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that, after the disappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between in-weights and in-context learning, which we term "context-constrained in-weights learning" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually replaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL transience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually share sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For example, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only be enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL thus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term "strategy coopetition." We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key dynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a setup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

Destabilizing AI developments could rupture the balance of power and raise the odds of great-power conflict, while widespread proliferation of capable AI hackers and virologists would lower barriers for rogue actors to cause catastrophe. Superintelligence -- AI vastly better than humans at nearly all cognitive tasks -- is now anticipated by AI researchers. Just as nations once developed nuclear strategies to secure their survival, we now need a coherent superintelligence strategy to navigate a new period of transformative change. We introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling nuclear mutual assured destruction (MAD) where any state's aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met with preventive sabotage by rivals. Given the relative ease of sabotaging a destabilizing AI project -- through interventions ranging from covert cyberattacks to potential kinetic strikes on datacenters -- MAIM already describes the strategic picture AI superpowers find themselves in. Alongside this, states can increase their competitiveness by bolstering their economies and militaries through AI, and they can engage in nonproliferation to rogue actors to keep weaponizable AI capabilities out of their hands. Taken together, the three-part framework of deterrence, nonproliferation, and competitiveness outlines a robust strategy to superintelligence in the years ahead.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://nationalsecurity.ai/</p></details> |

Roughly, the idea is to generalize binary state assertions to real-valued expectations, which can measure expected values of probabilistic program quantities. While loop-free programs can be analyzed by mechanically transforming expectations, verifying loops usually requires finding an invariant expectation, a difficult task. We propose a new view of invariant expectation synthesis as a regression problem: given an input state, predict the average value of the post-expectation in the output distribution. Guided by this perspective, we develop the first data-driven invariant synthesis method for probabilistic programs. Unlike prior work on probabilistic invariant inference, our approach can learn piecewise continuous invariants without relying on template expectations, and also works with black-box access to the program. We also develop a data-driven approach to learn sub-invariants from data, which can be used to upper- or lower-bound expected values. We implement our approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of benchmarks from the probabilistic programming literature.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Traditional phenotyping mainly relies on manual measurement, which is accurate but inefficient, more importantly, endangering the health and safety of people. Several studies have explored computer vision-based methods to replace manual phenotyping. However, the 2D-based need extra calibration, or cause destruction to fruit, or can only measure limited and meaningless traits. The 3D-based need extra depth camera, which is expensive and unacceptable for most farmers. In this paper, we propose a non-contact tomato fruit phenotyping method, titled TomatoScanner, where RGB image is all you need for input. First, pixel feature is extracted by instance segmentation of our proposed EdgeYOLO with preprocessing of individual separation and pose correction. Second, depth feature is extracted by depth estimation of Depth Pro. Third, pixel and depth feature are fused to output phenotype results in reality. We establish self-built Tomato Phenotype Dataset to test TomatoScanner, which achieves excellent phenotyping on width, height, vertical area and volume, with median relative error of 5.63%, 7.03%, -0.64% and 37.06%, respectively.

The method is based on a phase-field formulation of two-phase, compressible, inviscid flow with a trivial mixture model. Implicit shock tracking is a high-order, optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that automatically aligns mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps. It is used to accurately approximate shocks and rarefactions without stabilization and converge the phase-field solution to a sharp interface one by aligning mesh faces with the material interface. Time-dependent problems are formulated as steady problems in a space-time domain where complex wave interactions (e.g., intersections and reflections) manifest as space-time triplet points. The space-time formulation avoids complex re-meshing and solution transfer that would be required to track moving waves with mesh faces using the method of lines. The approach is applied to several two-phase flow Riemann problems involving gases with ideal, stiffened gas, and Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) equations of state, including a spherically symmetric underwater explosion problem. In all cases, the method aligns element faces with all shocks (including secondary shocks that form at time t > 0), rarefactions, and material interfaces, and accurately resolves the flow field on coarse space-time grids.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 figures |

Document VQA has gained popularity in recent years due to the increasing amount of documents and the high demand for digitization. Nonetheless, most of document VQA datasets are developed in high-resource languages such as English. In this paper, we present ReceiptVQA (\textbf{Receipt} \textbf{V}isual \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering), the initial large-scale document VQA dataset in Vietnamese dedicated to receipts, a document kind with high commercial potentials. The dataset encompasses \textbf{9,000+} receipt images and \textbf{60,000+} manually annotated question-answer pairs. In addition to our study, we introduce LiGT (\textbf{L}ayout-\textbf{i}nfused \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{T}ransformer), a layout-aware encoder-decoder architecture designed to leverage embedding layers of language models to operate layout embeddings, minimizing the use of additional neural modules. Experiments on ReceiptVQA show that our architecture yielded promising performance, achieving competitive results compared with outstanding baselines. Furthermore, throughout analyzing experimental results, we found evident patterns that employing encoder-only model architectures has considerable disadvantages in comparison to architectures that can generate answers. We also observed that it is necessary to combine multiple modalities to tackle our dataset, despite the critical role of semantic understanding from language models. We hope that our work will encourage and facilitate future development in Vietnamese document VQA, contributing to a diverse multimodal research community in the Vietnamese language.</p></details> | Accepted at IJDAR |

Among these methods, a recent subclass of approaches based on unsupervised keypoint detection stand out as very promising for interpretability. Specifically, these methods train a network to predict feature maps for fixed and moving images, from which explainable centres of mass are computed to obtain point clouds, that are then aligned in closed-form. However, the features returned by the network often yield spatially diffuse patterns that are hard to interpret, thus undermining the purpose of keypoint-based registration. Here, we propose a three-fold loss to regularise the spatial distribution of the features. First, we use the KL divergence to model features as point spread functions that we interpret as probabilistic keypoints. Then, we sharpen the spatial distributions of these features to increase the precision of the detected landmarks. Finally, we introduce a new repulsive loss across keypoints to encourage spatial diversity. Overall, our loss considerably improves the interpretability of the features, which now correspond to precise and anatomically meaningful landmarks. We demonstrate our three-fold loss in foetal rigid motion tracking and brain MRI affine registration tasks, where it not only outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised strategies, but also bridges the gap with state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BenBillot/spatial_regularisation.</p></details> | under review |

Moving beyond direct completion using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SigNet initially densifies sparse depth data through non-CNN densification tools to obtain coarse yet dense depth. This approach eliminates the mismatch and ambiguity caused by direct convolution over irregularly sampled sparse data. Subsequently, SigNet redefines completion as enhancement, establishing a self-supervised degradation bridge between the coarse depth and the targeted dense depth for effective RGB-D fusion. To achieve this, SigNet leverages the implicit degradation to adaptively select high-frequency components (e.g., edges) of RGB data to compensate for the coarse depth. This degradation is further integrated into a multi-modal conditional Mamba, dynamically generating the state parameters to enable efficient global high-frequency information interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on the NYUv2, DIML, SUN RGBD, and TOFDC datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SigNet.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

By analyzing the entropy distribution across transformer blocks, EWQ determines which blocks can be safely quantized without causing significant performance degradation, independent of model architecture or size. Our method outperforms uniform quantization approaches, maintaining Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) accuracy scores within 0.5% of unquantized models while reducing memory usage by up to 18%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EWQ across multiple architectures -- from 1.6B to 70B parameters -- and showcase consistent improvements in the quality-compression trade-off regardless of model scale or architectural design. A surprising finding of EWQ is its ability to reduce perplexity compared to unquantized models, suggesting the presence of beneficial regularization through selective precision reduction. This improvement holds across different model families, indicating a fundamental relationship between layer-level entropy and optimal precision requirements. Additionally, we introduce FastEWQ, a rapid method for entropy distribution analysis that eliminates the need for loading model weights. This technique leverages universal characteristics of entropy distribution that persist across various architectures and scales, enabling near-instantaneous quantization decisions while maintaining 80% classification accuracy with full entropy analysis. Our results demonstrate that effective quantization strategies can be developed independently of specific architectural choices or model sizes, opening new possibilities for efficient LLM deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures, 14 tables; Fixed some types, added some clarifications and improvements</p></details> |

| **[PRAM: Place Recognition Anywhere Model for Efficient Visual Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07785v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual localization is a key technique to a variety of applications, e.g., autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics. For these real applications, both efficiency and accuracy are important especially on edge devices with limited computing resources. However, previous frameworks, e.g., absolute pose regression (APR), scene coordinate regression (SCR), and the hierarchical method (HM), have limited either accuracy or efficiency in both indoor and outdoor environments. In this paper, we propose the place recognition anywhere model (PRAM), a new framework, to perform visual localization efficiently and accurately by recognizing 3D landmarks. Specifically, PRAM first generates landmarks directly in 3D space in a self-supervised manner. Without relying on commonly used classic semantic labels, these 3D landmarks can be defined in any place in indoor and outdoor scenes with higher generalization ability. Representing the map with 3D landmarks, PRAM discards global descriptors, repetitive local descriptors, and redundant 3D points, increasing the memory efficiency significantly. Then, sparse keypoints, rather than dense pixels, are utilized as the input tokens to a transformer-based recognition module for landmark recognition, which enables PRAM to recognize hundreds of landmarks with high time and memory efficiency. At test time, sparse keypoints and predicted landmark labels are utilized for outlier removal and landmark-wise 2D-3D matching as opposed to exhaustive 2D-2D matching, which further increases the time efficiency. A comprehensive evaluation of APRs, SCRs, HMs, and PRAM on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrates that PRAM outperforms ARPs and SCRs in large-scale scenes with a large margin and gives competitive accuracy to HMs but reduces over 90\% memory cost and runs 2.4 times faster, leading to a better balance between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://feixue94.github.io/pram-project/</p></details> |

NFN are specialized neural networks that treat the weights, gradients, or sparsity patterns of a deep neural network (DNN) as input data and have proven valuable for tasks such as learnable optimizers, implicit data representations, and weight editing. While NFN have been extensively developed for MLP and CNN, no prior work has addressed their design for transformers, despite the importance of transformers in modern deep learning. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a systematic study of NFN for transformers. We first determine the maximal symmetric group of the weights in a multi-head attention module as well as a necessary and sufficient condition under which two sets of hyperparameters of the multi-head attention module define the same function. We then define the weight space of transformer architectures and its associated group action, which leads to the design principles for NFN in transformers. Based on these, we introduce Transformer-NFN, an NFN that is equivariant under this group action. Additionally, we release a dataset of more than 125,000 Transformers model checkpoints trained on two datasets with two different tasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating Transformer-NFN and encouraging further research on transformer training and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Decentralized Sequencer and Data Availability Committee for Rollups Using Set Consensus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05451v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchains face a scalability challenge due to the intrinsic throughput limitations of consensus protocols and the limitation in block sizes due to decentralization. An alternative to improve the number of transactions per second is to use Layer 2 (L2) rollups. L2s perform most computations offchain using blockchains (L1) minimally under-the-hood to guarantee correctness. A sequencer receives offchain L2 transaction requests, batches them, and commits compressed or hashed batches to L1. Hashing offers much better compression but requires a data availability committee (DAC) to translate hashes back into their corresponding batches. Current L2s consist of a centralized sequencer which receives and serializes all transactions and an optional DAC. Centralized sequencers can undesirably influence L2s evolution. We propose in this paper a fully decentralized implementation of a service that combines (1) a sequencer that posts hashes to the L1 blockchain and (2) the data availability committee that reverses the hashes. We call the resulting service a (decentralized) arranger. Our decentralized arranger is based on Set Byzantine Consensus (SBC), a service where participants can propose sets of values and consensus is reached on a subset of the union of the values proposed. We extend SBC for our fully decentralized arranger. Our main contributions are (1) a formal definition of arrangers; (2) two implementations, one with a centralized sequencer and another with a fully decentralized algorithm, with their proof of correctness; and (3) empirical evidence that our solution scales by implementing all building blocks necessary to implement a correct server.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.02316</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Linear-MoE, a production-level system for modeling and training large-scale models that integrate LSM with MoE. Linear-MoE leverages the advantages of both LSM modules for linear-complexity sequence modeling and MoE layers for sparsely activation, aiming to offer high performance with efficient training. The Linear-MoE system comprises: 1) Modeling subsystem, which provides a unified framework supporting all instances of LSM. and 2) Training subsystem, which facilitates efficient training by incorporating various advanced parallelism technologies, particularly Sequence Parallelism designed for Linear-MoE models. Additionally, we explore hybrid models that combine Linear-MoE layers with standard Transformer-MoE layers with its Sequence Parallelism to further enhance model flexibility and performance. Evaluations on two model series, A0.3B-2B and A1B-7B, demonstrate Linear-MoE achieves efficiency gains while maintaining competitive performance on various benchmarks, showcasing its potential as a next-generation foundational model architecture.

Unlike other additive PEFT methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), Quantum-PEFT exploits an underlying full-rank yet surprisingly parameter efficient quantum unitary parameterization. With the use of Pauli parameterization, the number of trainable parameters grows only logarithmically with the ambient dimension, as opposed to linearly as in LoRA-based PEFT methods. Quantum-PEFT achieves vanishingly smaller number of trainable parameters than the lowest-rank LoRA as dimensions grow, enhancing parameter efficiency while maintaining a competitive performance. We apply Quantum-PEFT to several transfer learning benchmarks in language and vision, demonstrating significant advantages in parameter efficiency.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

The coefficient transform method for the conversion is stated for both Ito's and Stratonovich's interpretation of the SDE. Then we derive a mean and covariance fitting formula for probability distributions on Lie groups defined by a concentrated distribution on the exponential coordinate. It is used to derive the mean and covariance propagation equations for the SDE defined by injection, which coincides with the result derived from a Fokker-Planck equation in previous work. We also propose a simple modification to the update step of Kalman filters using the fitting formula, which improves the fusion accuracy with moderate computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CDC 2024; modified typos in theorem 2 and appendix A</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Revisiting the Generalization Problem of Low-level Vision Models Through the Lens of Image Deraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12600v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalization remains a significant challenge for low-level vision models, which often struggle with unseen degradations in real-world scenarios despite their success in controlled benchmarks. In this paper, we revisit the generalization problem in low-level vision models. Image deraining is selected as a case study due to its well-defined and easily decoupled structure, allowing for more effective observation and analysis. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that the generalization issue is not primarily due to limited network capacity but rather the failure of existing training strategies, which leads networks to overfit specific degradation patterns. Our findings show that guiding networks to focus on learning the underlying image content, rather than the degradation patterns, is key to improving generalization. We demonstrate that balancing the complexity of background images and degradations in the training data helps networks better fit the image distribution. Furthermore, incorporating content priors from pre-trained generative models significantly enhances generalization. Experiments on both image deraining and image denoising validate the proposed strategies. We believe the insights and solutions will inspire further research and improve the generalization of low-level vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.15134</p></details> |

This innovative approach, characterized by the use of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research.

Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI.

However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

A critical issue is the camera motion blur caused by movement during exposure, which hinders accurate 3D scene reconstruction. In this study, we propose CoMoGaussian, a Continuous Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting that reconstructs precise 3D scenes from motion-blurred images while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Considering the complex motion patterns inherent in real-world camera movements, we predict continuous camera trajectories using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To ensure accurate modeling, we employ rigid body transformations, preserving the shape and size of the object but rely on the discrete integration of sampled frames. To better approximate the continuous nature of motion blur, we introduce a continuous motion refinement (CMR) transformation that refines rigid transformations by incorporating additional learnable parameters. By revisiting fundamental camera theory and leveraging advanced neural ODE techniques, we achieve precise modeling of continuous camera trajectories, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on benchmark datasets, which include a wide range of motion blur scenarios, from moderate to extreme blur.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised Version of CRiM-GS, Github: https://github.com/Jho-Yonsei/CoMoGaussian</p></details> |

However, the role of 3D encoders with respect to other modalities remains unexplored. Furthermore, existing 3D foundation models that leverage large datasets are typically trained with explicit alignment objectives with respect to frozen encoders from other representations. In this work, we investigate the possibility of a posteriori alignment of representations obtained from uni-modal 3D encoders compared to text-based feature spaces. We show that naive post-training feature alignment of uni-modal text and 3D encoders results in limited performance. We then focus on extracting subspaces of the corresponding feature spaces and discover that by projecting learned representations onto well-chosen lower-dimensional subspaces the quality of alignment becomes significantly higher, leading to improved accuracy on matching and retrieval tasks. Our analysis further sheds light on the nature of these shared subspaces, which roughly separate between semantic and geometric data representations. Overall, ours is the first work that helps to establish a baseline for post-training alignment of 3D uni-modal and text feature spaces, and helps to highlight both the shared and unique properties of 3D data compared to other representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Large Language Models are Strong Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12319v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently become a focal point of research due to their formidable multimodal understanding capabilities. For example, in the audio and speech domains, an LLM can be equipped with (automatic) speech recognition (ASR) abilities by just concatenating the audio tokens, computed with an audio encoder, and the text tokens to achieve state-of-the-art results. On the contrary, tasks like visual and audio-visual speech recognition (VSR/AVSR), which also exploit noise-invariant lip movement information, have received little or no attention. To bridge this gap, we propose Llama-AVSR, a new MLLM with strong audio-visual speech recognition capabilities. It leverages pre-trained audio and video encoders to produce modality-specific tokens which, together with the text tokens, are processed by a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama3.1-8B) to yield the resulting response in an auto-regressive fashion. Llama-AVSR requires a small number of trainable parameters as only modality-specific projectors and LoRA modules are trained whereas the multi-modal encoders and LLM are kept frozen. We evaluate our proposed approach on LRS3, the largest public AVSR benchmark, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the tasks of ASR and AVSR with a WER of 0.79% and 0.77%, respectively. To bolster our results, we investigate the key factors that underpin the effectiveness of Llama-AVSR: the choice of the pre-trained encoders and LLM, the efficient integration of LoRA modules, and the optimal performance-efficiency trade-off obtained via modality-aware compression rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICASSP 2025.

However, challenges remain in accurately modeling driving scenes and generating long videos. To alleviate these issues, we propose DreamForge, an advanced diffusion-based autoregressive video generation model tailored for 3D-controllable long-term generation. To enhance the lane and foreground generation, we introduce perspective guidance and integrate object-wise position encoding to incorporate local 3D correlation and improve foreground object modeling. We also propose motion-aware temporal attention to capture motion cues and appearance changes in videos. By leveraging motion frames and an autoregressive generation paradigm,we can autoregressively generate long videos (over 200 frames) using a model trained in short sequences, achieving superior quality compared to the baseline in 16-frame video evaluations. Finally, we integrate our method with the realistic simulator DriveArena to provide more reliable open-loop and closed-loop evaluations for vision-based driving agents.

However, in contrast with their bigger counterparts, i.e., kg-scale drones, nano-drones expose three orders of magnitude less onboard memory and compute power, demanding more efficient and lightweight vision-based pipelines to win the race. This work presents a map-free vision-based (using only a monocular camera) autonomous nano-drone that combines a real-time deep learning gate detection front-end with a classic yet elegant and effective visual servoing control back-end, only relying on onboard resources. Starting from two state-of-the-art tiny deep learning models, we adapt them for our specific task, and after a mixed simulator-real-world training, we integrate and deploy them aboard our nano-drone. Our best-performing pipeline costs of only 24M multiply-accumulate operations per frame, resulting in a closed-loop control performance of 30 Hz, while achieving a gate detection root mean square error of 1.4 pixels, on our ~20k real-world image dataset. In-field experiments highlight the capability of our nano-drone to successfully navigate through 15 gates in 4 min, never crashing and covering a total travel distance of ~100m, with a peak flight speed of 1.9 m/s. Finally, to stress the generalization capability of our system, we also test it in a never-seen-before environment, where it navigates through gates for more than 4 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright}2025 IEEE.

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</p></details> | 39 pages |

Existing research addressing this problem has primarily been confined to image inputs, with limited exploration of video-based hallucinations. Furthermore, current evaluation methods fail to capture nuanced errors in generated responses, which are often exacerbated by the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of videos. To address this, we introduce VidHal, a benchmark specially designed to evaluate video-based hallucinations in VLLMs. VidHal is constructed by bootstrapping video instances across a wide range of common temporal aspects. A defining feature of our benchmark lies in the careful creation of captions which represent varying levels of hallucination associated with each video. To enable fine-grained evaluation, we propose a novel caption ordering task requiring VLLMs to rank captions by hallucinatory extent. We conduct extensive experiments on VidHal and comprehensively evaluate a broad selection of models. Our results uncover significant limitations in existing VLLMs regarding hallucination generation. Through our benchmark, we aim to inspire further research on 1) holistic understanding of VLLM capabilities, particularly regarding hallucination, and 2) extensive development of advanced VLLMs to alleviate this problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures.

However, these algorithms are trained to detect certain types of attacks. Furthermore, they are designed to operate on images acquired by specific capture devices, leading to poor generalization and a lack of robustness in handling the evolving nature of mobile hardware. The proposed investigation is the first to systematically analyze the performance degradation of existing deep learning PAD systems, convolutional and transformers, in cross-capture device settings. In this paper, we introduce the ColFigPhotoAttnNet architecture designed based on window attention on color channels, followed by the nested residual network as the predictor to achieve a reliable PAD. Extensive experiments using various capture devices, including iPhone13 Pro, GooglePixel 3, Nokia C5, and OnePlusOne, were carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed and existing methods on three publicly available databases.

A key approach is training reward models to guide preference optimization. However, existing models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that jointly learning to assess multiple tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment, enabling both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, which can be employed for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first develop UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, including both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, it is utilized to automatically construct high-quality preference pair data based on the vision models, fine-gradually filtering their outputs through pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, these data are used for their preference alignment through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results demonstrate that joint learning to assess diverse visual tasks can lead to substantial mutual benefits and we apply our pipeline to both image and video understanding/generation tasks, significantly improving the performance in each domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/</p></details> |

Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SymmetryAdvantage/WyckoffTransformer</p></details> |

In this vein, we introduce MetaEntailRE, a novel adaptation method that harnesses NLI principles to enhance RE performance. Our approach follows past works by verbalizing relation classes into class-indicative hypotheses, aligning a traditionally multi-class classification task to one of textual entailment. We introduce three key enhancements: (1) Meta-class analysis which, instead of labeling non-entailed premise-hypothesis pairs with the less informative "neutral" entailment label, provides additional context by analyzing overarching meta-relationships between classes; (2) Feasible hypothesis filtering, which removes unlikely hypotheses from consideration based on domain knowledge derived from data; and (3) Group-based prediction selection, which further improves performance by selecting highly confident predictions. MetaEntailRE is conceptually simple and empirically powerful, yielding significant improvements over conventional relation extraction techniques and other NLI formulations. We observe surprisingly large F1 gains of 17.6 points on BioRED and 13.4 points on ReTACRED compared to conventional methods, underscoring the versatility of MetaEntailRE across both biomedical and general domains.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure |

However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet's expressivity by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |

However, these models often suffer from hallucinations and inefficiencies due to their reliance solely on internal reasoning processes. In this paper, we introduce START (Self-Taught Reasoner with Tools), a novel tool-integrated long CoT reasoning LLM that significantly enhances reasoning capabilities by leveraging external tools. Through code execution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking, exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the limitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning framework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate that inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python here is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively stimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any demonstration data. Hint-infer can also serve as a simple and effective sequential test-time scaling method; 2) Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (Hint-RFT): Hint-RFT combines Hint-infer and RFT by scoring, filtering, and modifying the reasoning trajectories with tool invocation generated by a LRM via Hint-infer, followed by fine-tuning the LRM. Through this framework, we have fine-tuned the QwQ-32B model to achieve START. On PhD-level science QA (GPQA), competition-level math benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24, AIME25), and the competition-level code benchmark (LiveCodeBench), START achieves accuracy rates of 63.6%, 95.0%, 66.7%, 47.1%, and 47.3%, respectively. It significantly outperforms the base QwQ-32B and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art open-weight model R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and the proprietary model o1-Preview.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 5 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally.

This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose Flattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

Despite the relevance of these applications, existing solutions are unsatisfactory as they require severely restricted model architectures or rely on energy-based training, which is prone to instability. We introduce TRADE, which overcomes these limitations by formulating the learning process as a boundary value problem. By initially training the model for a specific condition using either i.i.d.~samples or backward KL training, we establish a boundary distribution. We then propagate this information across other conditions using the gradient of the unnormalized density with respect to the external parameter. This formulation, akin to the principles of physics-informed neural networks, allows us to efficiently learn parameter-dependent distributions without restrictive assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that TRADE achieves excellent results in a wide range of applications, ranging from Bayesian inference and molecular simulations to physical lattice models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Poster at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Invariant Learning for Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05421v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Morgan and McIver's weakest pre-expectation framework is one of the most well-established methods for deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Roughly, the idea is to generalize binary state assertions to real-valued expectations, which can measure expected values of probabilistic program quantities. While loop-free programs can be analyzed by mechanically transforming expectations, verifying loops usually requires finding an invariant expectation, a difficult task. We propose a new view of invariant expectation synthesis as a regression problem: given an input state, predict the average value of the post-expectation in the output distribution. Guided by this perspective, we develop the first data-driven invariant synthesis method for probabilistic programs. Unlike prior work on probabilistic invariant inference, our approach can learn piecewise continuous invariants without relying on template expectations, and also works with black-box access to the program. We also develop a data-driven approach to learn sub-invariants from data, which can be used to upper- or lower-bound expected values. We implement our approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of benchmarks from the probabilistic programming literature.</p></details> | 37 pages |

In the last few months, more than 10 new methods have been proposed to perform Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) against LLMs. Contrary to traditional MIAs which rely on fixed-but randomized-records or models, these methods are mostly trained and tested on datasets collected post-hoc. Sets of members and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using informed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization raises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In this work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and show that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc setups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are considered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in the literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all datasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts. These shifts invalidate the claims of LLMs memorizing strongly in real-world scenarios and, potentially, also the methodological contributions of the recent papers based on these datasets. Yet, all hope might not be lost. We introduce important considerations to properly evaluate MIAs against LLMs and discuss, in turn, potential ways forwards: randomized test splits, injections of randomized (unique) sequences, randomized fine-tuning, and several post-hoc control methods. While each option comes with its advantages and limitations, we believe they collectively provide solid grounds to guide MIA development and study LLM memorization. We conclude with an overview of recommended approaches to benchmark sequence-level and document-level MIAs against LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML 2025)</p></details> |

However, the limited computational power of edge devices poses a challenge in deploying complex super-resolution neural networks, highlighting the need for efficient methods. While prior works have made significant progress, they have not fully exploited pixel-level information. Moreover, their reliance on fixed sampling patterns limits both accuracy and the ability to capture fine details in low-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce two plug-and-play modules designed to capture and leverage pixel information effectively in Look-Up Table (LUT) based super-resolution networks. Our method introduces Automatic Sampling (AutoSample), a flexible LUT sampling approach where sampling weights are automatically learned during training to adapt to pixel variations and expand the receptive field without added inference cost. We also incorporate Adaptive Residual Learning (AdaRL) to enhance inter-layer connections, enabling detailed information flow and improving the network's ability to reconstruct fine details. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on both MuLUT and SPF-LUT while maintaining similar storage sizes. Specifically, for MuLUT, we achieve a PSNR improvement of approximately +0.20 dB improvement on average across five datasets. For SPF-LUT, with more than a 50% reduction in storage space and about a 2/3 reduction in inference time, our method still maintains performance comparable to the original.

We use atomic decomposition of hypotheses in two natural language reasoning tasks, traditional NLI and defeasible NLI, to form atomic sub-problems, or granular inferences that models must weigh when solving the overall problem. These atomic sub-problems serve as a tool to further understand the structure of both NLI and defeasible reasoning, probe a model's consistency and understanding of different inferences, and measure the diversity of examples in benchmark datasets. Our results indicate that LLMs still struggle with logical consistency on atomic NLI and defeasible NLI sub-problems. Lastly, we identify critical atomic sub-problems of defeasible NLI examples, or those that most contribute to the overall label, and propose a method to measure the inferential consistency of a model, a metric designed to capture the degree to which a model makes consistently correct or incorrect predictions about the same fact under different contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |

They identified several stakeholders and defined modeling perspectives, architecture viewpoints, and views to frame and address stakeholder concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML) related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be included in existing architecture frameworks. Only this way can we envision a holistic system architecture description of an ML-enabled system. Note that the ML component behavior and functionalities are special and should be distinguished from traditional software system behavior and functionalities. The main reason is that the actual functionality should be inferred from data instead of being specified at design time. Additionally, the structural models of ML components, such as ML model architectures, are typically specified using different notations and formalisms from what the Software Engineering (SE) community uses for software structural models. Yet, these two aspects, namely ML and non-ML, are becoming so intertwined that it necessitates an extension of software architecture frameworks and modeling practices toward supporting ML-enabled system architectures. In this paper, we address this gap through an empirical study using an online survey instrument. We surveyed 61 subject matter experts from over 25 organizations in 10 countries.</p></details> | ICICT 2025 |
| **[MeanCache: User-Centric Semantic Caching for LLM Web Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02694v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Llama have revolutionized natural language processing and search engine dynamics. However, these models incur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point operations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on repeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However, existing caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among LLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable false hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric semantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar queries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a user's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather than re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and environmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to collaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy. By placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces the latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false hit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query, offering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query responses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the state-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately 17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It also reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache hit-and-miss decisions by 11%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE 39th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)</p></details> |

Training data proofs play a key role in recent lawsuits against foundation models trained on web-scale data. Many prior works suggest to instantiate training data proofs using membership inference attacks. We argue that this approach is fundamentally unsound: to provide convincing evidence, the data creator needs to demonstrate that their attack has a low false positive rate, i.e., that the attack's output is unlikely under the null hypothesis that the model was not trained on the target data. Yet, sampling from this null hypothesis is impossible, as we do not know the exact contents of the training set, nor can we (efficiently) retrain a large foundation model. We conclude by offering two paths forward, by showing that data extraction attacks and membership inference on special canary data can be used to create sound training data proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>posit...</summary><p>position paper at IEEE SaTML 2025</p></details> |
| **[LIFT: Improving Long Context Understanding of Large Language Models through Long Input Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14644v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long context understanding remains challenging for large language models due to their limited context windows. This paper presents Long Input Fine-Tuning (LIFT), a novel framework for long-context modeling that can improve the long-context performance of arbitrary (short-context) LLMs by dynamically adapting model parameters based on the long input. Importantly, LIFT, rather than endlessly extending the context window size to accommodate increasingly longer inputs in context, chooses to store and absorb the long input in parameter. By fine-tuning the long input into model parameters, LIFT allows short-context LLMs to answer questions even when the required information is not provided in the context during inference. Furthermore, to enhance LIFT performance while maintaining the original in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, we introduce Gated Memory, a specialized attention adapter that automatically balances long input memorization and ICL. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and limitations of LIFT on long context understanding, offering valuable directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.13626</p></details> |

There are opportunities for better cooperation if the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected. Namely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate resources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a single Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet demodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI on low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a wired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester, while running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use openwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio (SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a CTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection feedback to the AP. We show experimentally that it can fully mitigate the 35% throughput loss caused by CTI when the AP applies the appropriate scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures.

The complexity increases further if the environment layout changes, making the prior computed global plan infeasible. In this paper, we show that it is possible to dramatically enhance crowd navigation by just improving the local planner. Our approach combines generative modelling with inference time optimization to generate sophisticated long-horizon local plans at interactive rates. More specifically, we train a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder to learn a prior over the expert trajectory distribution conditioned on the perception input. At run-time, this is used as an initialization for a sampling-based optimizer for further refinement. Our approach does not require any sophisticated prediction of dynamic obstacles and yet provides state-of-the-art performance. In particular, we compare against the recent DRL-VO approach and show a 40% improvement in success rate and a 6% improvement in travel time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Existing Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes provide full security but suffer from poor scalability, limiting their applicability in large-scale deployment. We argue that in many real-world scenarios, a more practical solution should allow users to flexibly determine the privacy levels of their queries in a theoretically guided way, balancing security and performance based on specific needs. To formally provide provable guarantees, we introduce a novel concept of distance-based indistinguishability, which can facilitate users to comfortably relax their security requirements. We then design Femur, an efficient framework to securely query public key-value stores with flexible security and performance trade-offs. It uses a space-efficient learned index to convert query keys into storage locations, obfuscates these locations with extra noise provably derived by the distance-based indistinguishability theory, and sends the expanded range to the server. The server then adaptively utilizes the best scheme to retrieve data. We also propose a novel variable-range PIR scheme optimized for bandwidth-constrained environments. Experiments show that Femur outperforms the state-of-the-art designs even when ensuring the same full security level. When users are willing to relax their privacy requirements, Femur can further improve the performance gains to up to 163.9X, demonstrating an effective trade-off between security and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, traditional visual place recognition (VPR) methods rely solely on single-view visual information and cannot interpret human language descriptions. To overcome this challenge, we bridge text and vision by proposing a multiview (360{\deg} views of the surroundings) text-vision registration approach called Text4VPR for place recognition task, which is the first method that exclusively utilizes textual descriptions to match a database of images. Text4VPR employs the frozen T5 language model to extract global textual embeddings. Additionally, it utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm with temperature coefficient to assign local tokens to their respective clusters, thereby aggregating visual descriptors from images. During the training stage, Text4VPR emphasizes the alignment between individual text-image pairs for precise textual description. In the inference stage, Text4VPR uses the Cascaded Cross-Attention Cosine Alignment (CCCA) to address the internal mismatch between text and image groups. Subsequently, Text4VPR performs precisely place match based on the descriptions of text-image groups. On Street360Loc, the first text to image VPR dataset we created, Text4VPR builds a robust baseline, achieving a leading top-1 accuracy of 57% and a leading top-10 accuracy of 92% within a 5-meter radius on the test set, which indicates that localization from textual descriptions to images is not only feasible but also holds significant potential for further advancement, as shown in Figure 1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

While building energy management systems (BEMS) equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs) can provide FFR, individual BEMS alone cannot fully meet demand. To address this, we propose a community energy management system (CEMS) operational model that minimizes energy costs and generates additional revenue, which is provided FFR through coordinated DERs and building loads under photovoltaic (PV) generation uncertainty. The model incorporates a hierarchical control framework with three levels: Level 1 allocates maximum FFR capacity, Level 2 employs scenario-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) to adjust DER operations and ensure FFR provision despite PV uncertainties, and Level 3 performs rapid load adjustments in response to frequency fluctuations detected by a frequency meter. Simulation results on a campus building cluster demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving a 10\% reduction in energy costs and a 24\% increase in FFR capacity, all while maintaining occupant comfort and enhancing frequency stabilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, submitted to PES General Meeting 2025</p></details> |

Behavior trees (BTs) are increasingly used in robot task planning for their modularity and flexibility, but creating them manually can be effort-intensive. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to robotic task planning for generating action sequences, yet their ability to generate BTs has not been fully investigated. To this end, we propose LLM-as-BT-Planner, a novel framework that leverages LLMs for BT generation in robotic assembly task planning. Four in-context learning methods are introduced to utilize the natural language processing and inference capabilities of LLMs for producing task plans in BT format, reducing manual effort while ensuring robustness and comprehensibility. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of fine-tuned smaller LLMs on the same tasks. Experiments in both simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that our framework enhances LLMs' ability to generate BTs, improving success rate through in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Here, we introduce an equivalent formulation of the objective function of KRR, which opens up for replacing the ridge penalty with the $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_1$ penalties. Using the $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_1$ penalties, we obtain robust and sparse kernel regression, respectively. We study the similarities between explicitly regularized kernel regression and the solutions obtained by early stopping of iterative gradient-based methods, where we connect $\ell_\infty$ regularization to sign gradient descent, $\ell_1$ regularization to forward stagewise regression (also known as coordinate descent), and $\ell_2$ regularization to gradient descent, and, in the last case, theoretically bound for the differences. We exploit the close relations between $\ell_\infty$ regularization and sign gradient descent, and between $\ell_1$ regularization and coordinate descent to propose computationally efficient methods for robust and sparse kernel regression. We finally compare robust kernel regression through sign gradient descent to existing methods for robust kernel regression on five real data sets, demonstrating that our method is one to two orders of magnitude faster, without compromised accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article arXiv:2306.16838v1 has been updated and split into two articles: this article and arXiv:2311.01762.

However, applying existing RL methods to timestep-distilled DMs is challenging for ultra-fast ($\le2$-step) image generation. Our analysis suggests several limitations of policy-based RL methods such as PPO or DPO toward this goal. Based on the insights, we propose fine-tuning DMs with learned differentiable surrogate rewards. Our method, named LaSRO, learns surrogate reward models in the latent space of SDXL to convert arbitrary rewards into differentiable ones for efficient reward gradient guidance. LaSRO leverages pre-trained latent DMs for reward modeling and specifically targets image generation $\le2$ steps for reward optimization, enhancing generalizability and efficiency. LaSRO is effective and stable for improving ultra-fast image generation with different reward objectives, outperforming popular RL methods including PPO and DPO. We further show LaSRO's connection to value-based RL, providing theoretical insights. See our webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/lasro.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

We demonstrate that a certain CUSUM-type statistic attains the minimax optimal rates for localizing the change point. Our minimax analysis unveils an interesting phase transition from a jump (discontinuity in values) to a kink (change in slope). Specifically, for a jump, the minimax rate is of order $\log (n) / n$, whereas for a kink it scales as $\bigl(\log (n) / n\bigr)^{1/3}$, given that the sampling rate is of order $1/n$. We further introduce an algorithm for the proposed online change point detector, which requires constant computational steps and constant memory per incoming sample. Finally, the empirical performance of our method is examined on both simulated and real-world data sets.

However, in contrast with their bigger counterparts, i.e., kg-scale drones, nano-drones expose three orders of magnitude less onboard memory and compute power, demanding more efficient and lightweight vision-based pipelines to win the race. This work presents a map-free vision-based (using only a monocular camera) autonomous nano-drone that combines a real-time deep learning gate detection front-end with a classic yet elegant and effective visual servoing control back-end, only relying on onboard resources. Starting from two state-of-the-art tiny deep learning models, we adapt them for our specific task, and after a mixed simulator-real-world training, we integrate and deploy them aboard our nano-drone. Our best-performing pipeline costs of only 24M multiply-accumulate operations per frame, resulting in a closed-loop control performance of 30 Hz, while achieving a gate detection root mean square error of 1.4 pixels, on our ~20k real-world image dataset. In-field experiments highlight the capability of our nano-drone to successfully navigate through 15 gates in 4 min, never crashing and covering a total travel distance of ~100m, with a peak flight speed of 1.9 m/s. Finally, to stress the generalization capability of our system, we also test it in a never-seen-before environment, where it navigates through gates for more than 4 min.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright}2025 IEEE.

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.</p></details> | 39 pages |

However, operator dependency and technical limitations (e.g. intrinsic artefacts and effects, setting errors) can complicate image interpretation and the assessment of diagnostic uncertainty. We present L-FUSION (Laplacian Fetal US Segmentation with Integrated FoundatiON models), a framework that integrates uncertainty quantification through unsupervised, normative learning and large-scale foundation models for robust segmentation of fetal structures in normal and pathological scans. We propose to utilise the aleatoric logit distributions of Stochastic Segmentation Networks and Laplace approximations with fast Hessian estimations to estimate epistemic uncertainty only from the segmentation head. This enables us to achieve reliable abnormality quantification for instant diagnostic feedback. Combined with an integrated Dropout component, L-FUSION enables reliable differentiation of lesions from normal fetal anatomy with enhanced uncertainty maps and segmentation counterfactuals in US imaging. It improves epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty interpretation and removes the need for manual disease-labelling. Evaluations across multiple datasets show that L-FUSION achieves superior segmentation accuracy and consistent uncertainty quantification, supporting on-site decision-making and offering a scalable solution for advancing fetal ultrasound analysis in clinical settings.</p></details> | Under Review |

While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 + ...</summary><p>28 + 20 pages, 13 Figures, v2: generalized analytical results to degree D, extended discussion</p></details> |

Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SymmetryAdvantage/WyckoffTransformer</p></details> |
| **[BigMac: A Communication-Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Model Structure for Fast Training and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16927v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure scales the Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and improves their performance with only the sub-linear increase in computation resources. Recently, a fine-grained DeepSeekMoE structure is proposed, which can further improve the computing efficiency of MoE without performance degradation. However, the All-to-All communication introduced by MoE has become a bottleneck, especially for the fine-grained structure, which typically involves and activates more experts, hence contributing to heavier communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel MoE structure named BigMac, which is also fine-grained but with high communication efficiency. The innovation of BigMac is mainly due to that we abandon the \textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{d}escend-\textbf{a}scend-\textbf{c}ommunicate (CDAC) manner used by fine-grained MoE, which leads to the All-to-All communication always taking place at the highest dimension. Instead, BigMac designs an efficient \textbf{d}escend-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{c}ommunicate-\textbf{a}scend (DCCA) manner. Specifically, we add a descending and ascending projection at the entrance and exit of the expert, respectively, which enables the communication to perform at a very low dimension. Furthermore, to adapt to DCCA, we re-design the structure of small experts, ensuring that the expert in BigMac has enough complexity to address tokens. Experimental results show that BigMac achieves comparable or even better model quality than fine-grained MoEs with the same number of experts and a similar number of total parameters. Equally importantly, BigMac reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 3.09$\times$ for training and increases the throughput by up to 3.11$\times$ for inference on state-of-the-art AI computing frameworks including Megatron, Tutel, and DeepSpeed-Inference.</p></details> | Typo Fixed |

Whereas supervised learning requires pre-solved instances for training, our approach leverages a custom loss function derived from the exact penalty method in optimization to learn an approximation, typically defined by a neural network model, of the parameterized optimal solution mapping. Additionally, we adapt our approach to robust constrained combinatorial optimization problems by incorporating a surrogate linear cost over mixed integer domains, and a smooth approximations thereof, into the final layer of the network architecture. We perform computational experiments to test our approach on three different applications: multidimensional knapsack with continuous variables, combinatorial multidimensional knapsack with discrete variables, and an inventory management problem. Our results demonstrate that our self-supervised approach is able to effectively learn neural network approximations whose inference time is significantly smaller than the computation time of traditional solvers for this class of robust optimization problems. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that by varying the penalty parameter we are able to effectively balance the trade-off between sub-optimality and robust feasibility of the obtained solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of CPAIOR 2025</p></details> |

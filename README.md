| **[Concept Lancet: Image Editing with Compositional Representation Transplant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02828v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

| **[Envisioning Beyond the Pixels: Benchmarking Reasoning-Informed Visual Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02826v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in visual understanding and generation, but they still face challenges in General Visual Editing, particularly in following complex instructions, preserving appearance consistency, and supporting flexible input formats. To address this gap, we introduce RISEBench, the first benchmark for evaluating Reasoning-Informed viSual Editing (RISE). RISEBench focuses on four key reasoning types: Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical Reasoning. We curate high-quality test cases for each category and propose an evaluation framework that assesses Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility with both human judges and an LMM-as-a-judge approach. Our experiments reveal that while GPT-4o-Native significantly outperforms other open-source and proprietary models, even this state-of-the-art system struggles with logical reasoning tasks, highlighting an area that remains underexplored. As an initial effort, RISEBench aims to provide foundational insights into reasoning-aware visual editing and to catalyze future research. Though still in its early stages, we are committed to continuously expanding and refining the benchmark to support more comprehensive, reliable, and scalable evaluations of next-generation multimodal systems. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 23 figures, 1 table. Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[On Vanishing Variance in Transformer Length Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02827v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a widely known issue that Transformers, when trained on shorter sequences, fail to generalize robustly to longer ones at test time. This raises the question of whether Transformer models are real reasoning engines, despite their impressive abilities in mathematical problem solving and code synthesis. In this paper, we offer a vanishing variance perspective on this issue. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that even for today's frontier models, a longer sequence length results in a decrease in variance in the output of the multi-head attention modules. On the argmax retrieval and dictionary lookup tasks, our experiments show that applying layer normalization after the attention outputs leads to significantly better length generalization. Our analyses attribute this improvement to a reduction-though not a complete elimination-of the distribution shift caused by vanishing variance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ruiningli.com/vanishing-variance.

| **[SAT: Dynamic Spatial Aptitude Training for Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07755v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about motion and space is a fundamental cognitive capability that is required by multiple real-world applications. While many studies highlight that large multimodal language models (MLMs) struggle to reason about space, they only focus on static spatial relationships, and not dynamic awareness of motion and space, i.e., reasoning about the effect of egocentric and object motions on spatial relationships. Manually annotating such object and camera movements is expensive. Hence, we introduce SAT, a simulated spatial aptitude training dataset comprising both static and dynamic spatial reasoning across 175K question-answer (QA) pairs and 20K scenes. Complementing this, we also construct a small (150 image-QAs) yet challenging dynamic spatial test set using real-world images. Leveraging our SAT datasets and 6 existing static spatial benchmarks, we systematically investigate what improves both static and dynamic spatial awareness. Our results reveal that simulations are surprisingly effective at imparting spatial aptitude to MLMs that translate to real images. We show that perfect annotations in simulation are more effective than existing approaches of pseudo-annotating real images. For instance, SAT training improves a LLaVA-13B model by an average 11% and a LLaVA-Video-7B model by an average 8% on multiple spatial benchmarks, including our real-image dynamic test set and spatial reasoning on long videos -- even outperforming some large proprietary models. While reasoning over static relationships improves with synthetic training data, there is still considerable room for improvement for dynamic reasoning questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://arijitray.com/SAT/</p></details> |
| **[THRONE: An Object-based Hallucination Benchmark for the Free-form Generations of Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05256v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term "Type I hallucinations". Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats -- typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute -- which we term "Type II hallucinations". Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of hallucinations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline. Code is now available at https://github.com/amazon-science/THRONE .</p></details> | <details><summary>In CV...</summary><p>In CVPR 2024. Code https://github.com/amazon-science/THRONE</p></details> |
| **[STING-BEE: Towards Vision-Language Model for Real-World X-ray Baggage Security Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02823v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in Computer-Aided Screening (CAS) systems are essential for improving the detection of security threats in X-ray baggage scans. However, current datasets are limited in representing real-world, sophisticated threats and concealment tactics, and existing approaches are constrained by a closed-set paradigm with predefined labels. To address these challenges, we introduce STCray, the first multimodal X-ray baggage security dataset, comprising 46,642 image-caption paired scans across 21 threat categories, generated using an X-ray scanner for airport security. STCray is meticulously developed with our specialized protocol that ensures domain-aware, coherent captions, that lead to the multi-modal instruction following data in X-ray baggage security. This allows us to train a domain-aware visual AI assistant named STING-BEE that supports a range of vision-language tasks, including scene comprehension, referring threat localization, visual grounding, and visual question answering (VQA), establishing novel baselines for multi-modal learning in X-ray baggage security. Further, STING-BEE shows state-of-the-art generalization in cross-domain settings. Code, data, and models are available at https://divs1159.github.io/STING-BEE/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Autoencoders Learn Monosemantic Features in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02821v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently been shown to enhance interpretability and steerability in Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we extend the application of SAEs to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, and introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating monosemanticity in vision representations. Our experimental results reveal that SAEs trained on VLMs significantly enhance the monosemanticity of individual neurons while also exhibiting hierarchical representations that align well with expert-defined structures (e.g., iNaturalist taxonomy). Most notably, we demonstrate that applying SAEs to intervene on a CLIP vision encoder, directly steer output from multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) without any modifications to the underlying model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised approach for enhancing both the interpretability and control of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Efficient Autoregressive Shape Generation via Octree-Based Adaptive Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02817v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many 3D generative models rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn compact shape representations. However, existing methods encode all shapes into a fixed-size token, disregarding the inherent variations in scale and complexity across 3D data. This leads to inefficient latent representations that can compromise downstream generation. We address this challenge by introducing Octree-based Adaptive Tokenization, a novel framework that adjusts the dimension of latent representations according to shape complexity. Our approach constructs an adaptive octree structure guided by a quadric-error-based subdivision criterion and allocates a shape latent vector to each octree cell using a query-based transformer. Building upon this tokenization, we develop an octree-based autoregressive generative model that effectively leverages these variable-sized representations in shape generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces token counts by 50% compared to fixed-size methods while maintaining comparable visual quality. When using a similar token length, our method produces significantly higher-quality shapes. When incorporated with our downstream generative model, our method creates more detailed and diverse 3D content than existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://oat-3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[BOP Challenge 2024 on Model-Based and Model-Free 6D Object Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02812v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the evaluation methodology, datasets and results of the BOP Challenge 2024, the sixth in a series of public competitions organized to capture the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation and related tasks. In 2024, our goal was to transition BOP from lab-like setups to real-world scenarios. First, we introduced new model-free tasks, where no 3D object models are available and methods need to onboard objects just from provided reference videos. Second, we defined a new, more practical 6D object detection task where identities of objects visible in a test image are not provided as input. Third, we introduced new BOP-H3 datasets recorded with high-resolution sensors and AR/VR headsets, closely resembling real-world scenarios. BOP-H3 include 3D models and onboarding videos to support both model-based and model-free tasks. Participants competed on seven challenge tracks, each defined by a task, object onboarding setup, and dataset group. Notably, the best 2024 method for model-based 6D localization of unseen objects (FreeZeV2.1) achieves 22% higher accuracy on BOP-Classic-Core than the best 2023 method (GenFlow), and is only 4% behind the best 2023 method for seen objects (GPose2023) although being significantly slower (24.9 vs 2.7s per image). A more practical 2024 method for this task is Co-op which takes only 0.8s per image and is 25X faster and 13% more accurate than GenFlow. Methods have a similar ranking on 6D detection as on 6D localization but higher run time. On model-based 2D detection of unseen objects, the best 2024 method (MUSE) achieves 21% relative improvement compared to the best 2023 method (CNOS). However, the 2D detection accuracy for unseen objects is still noticealy (-53%) behind the accuracy for seen objects (GDet2023).

| **[Measuring temporal effects of agent knowledge by date-controlled tool use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04188v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal progression is an integral part of knowledge accumulation and update. Web search is frequently adopted as grounding for agent knowledge, yet an improper configuration affects the quality of the agent's responses. Here, we assess the agent behavior using distinct date-controlled tools (DCTs) as stress test to measure the knowledge variability of large language model (LLM) agents. We demonstrate the temporal effects of an LLM agent as a writing assistant, which uses web search to complete scientific publication abstracts. We show that the temporality of search engine translates into tool-dependent agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that agent design and evaluations should take a dynamical view and implement measures to account for the temporal influence of external resources to ensure reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[MegaMath: Pushing the Limits of Open Math Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02807v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of human intelligence and a key benchmark for advanced capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, the research community still lacks an open, large-scale, high-quality corpus tailored to the demands of math-centric LLM pre-training. We present MegaMath, an open dataset curated from diverse, math-focused sources through following practices: (1) Revisiting web data: We re-extracted mathematical documents from Common Crawl with math-oriented HTML optimizations, fasttext-based filtering and deduplication, all for acquiring higher-quality data on the Internet. (2) Recalling Math-related code data: We identified high quality math-related code from large code training corpus, Stack-V2, further enhancing data diversity. (3) Exploring Synthetic data: We synthesized QA-style text, math-related code, and interleaved text-code blocks from web data or code data. By integrating these strategies and validating their effectiveness through extensive ablations, MegaMath delivers 371B tokens with the largest quantity and top quality among existing open math pre-training datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 15 figures, 22 tables</p></details> |

Exact simulation algorithms are developed in parallel with closed-form expressions that characterize the model's dynamics. This framework enables the generation of synthetic event streams in genuine continuous-time, which combined with the analytical results, reveal the underlying mechanisms driving the oscillatory behavior of event data presented in the literature.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Survey of Large Language Models in Mental Health Disorder Detection on Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02800v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and intervention of mental health issues represent a critical global research focus, and social media data has been recognized as an important resource for mental health research. However, how to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health problem detection on social media poses significant challenges. Hence, this paper aims to explore the potential of LLM applications in social media data analysis, focusing not only on the most common psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety but also incorporating psychotic disorders and externalizing disorders, summarizing the application methods of LLM from different dimensions, such as text data analysis and detection of mental disorders, and revealing the major challenges and shortcomings of current research. In addition, the paper provides an overview of popular datasets, and evaluation metrics. The survey in this paper provides a comprehensive frame of reference for researchers in the field of mental health, while demonstrating the great potential of LLMs in mental health detection to facilitate the further application of LLMs in future mental health interventions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[ADO-LLM: Analog Design Bayesian Optimization with In-Context Learning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18770v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog circuit design requires substantial human expertise and involvement, which is a significant roadblock to design productivity. Bayesian Optimization (BO), a popular machine learning based optimization strategy, has been leveraged to automate analog design given its applicability across various circuit topologies and technologies. Traditional BO methods employ black box Gaussian Process surrogate models and optimized labeled data queries to find optimization solutions by trading off between exploration and exploitation. However, the search for the optimal design solution in BO can be expensive from both a computational and data usage point of view, particularly for high dimensional optimization problems. This paper presents ADO-LLM, the first work integrating large language models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization for analog design optimization. ADO-LLM leverages the LLM's ability to infuse domain knowledge to rapidly generate viable design points to remedy BO's inefficiency in finding high value design areas specifically under the limited design space coverage of the BO's probabilistic surrogate model. In the meantime, sampling of design points evaluated in the iterative BO process provides quality demonstrations for the LLM to generate high quality design points while leveraging infused broad design knowledge. Furthermore, the diversity brought by BO's exploration enriches the contextual understanding of the LLM and allows it to more broadly search in the design space and prevent repetitive and redundant suggestions. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different types of analog circuits and demonstrate notable improvements in design efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Framework for Situating Innovations, Opportunities, and Challenges in Advancing Vertical Systems with Large AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02793v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large artificial intelligence (AI) models have garnered significant attention for their remarkable, often "superhuman", performance on standardized benchmarks. However, when these models are deployed in high-stakes verticals such as healthcare, education, and law, they often reveal notable limitations. For instance, they exhibit brittleness to minor variations in input data, present contextually uninformed decisions in critical settings, and undermine user trust by confidently producing or reproducing inaccuracies. These challenges in applying large models necessitate cross-disciplinary innovations to align the models' capabilities with the needs of real-world applications. We introduce a framework that addresses this gap through a layer-wise abstraction of innovations aimed at meeting users' requirements with large models. Through multiple case studies, we illustrate how researchers and practitioners across various fields can operationalize this framework. Beyond modularizing the pipeline of transforming large models into useful "vertical systems", we also highlight the dynamism that exists within different layers of the framework. Finally, we discuss how our framework can guide researchers and practitioners to (i) optimally situate their innovations (e.g., when vertical-specific insights can empower broadly impactful vertical-agnostic innovations), (ii) uncover overlooked opportunities (e.g., spotting recurring problems across verticals to develop practically useful foundation models instead of chasing benchmarks), and (iii) facilitate cross-disciplinary communication of critical challenges (e.g., enabling a shared vocabulary for AI developers, domain experts, and human-computer interaction scholars).</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print; 7 pages of main content, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Triadic Closure: Finding Dense Structures in Social Networks That Evolve](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09567v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A graph G is c-closed if every two vertices with at least c common neighbors are adjacent to each other. Introduced by Fox, Roughgarden, Seshadhri, Wei and Wein [ICALP 2018, SICOMP 2020], this definition is an abstraction of the triadic closure property exhibited by many real-world social networks, namely, friends of friends tend to be friends themselves. Social networks, however, are often temporal rather than static -- the connections change over a period of time. And hence temporal graphs, rather than static graphs, are often better suited to model social networks. Motivated by this, we introduce a definition of temporal c-closed graphs, in which if two vertices u and v have at least c common neighbors during a short interval of time, then u and v are adjacent to each other around that time. Our pilot experiments show that several real-world temporal networks are c-closed for rather small values of c. We also study the computational problems of enumerating maximal cliques and similar dense subgraphs in temporal c-closed graphs; a clique in a temporal graph is a subgraph that lasts for a certain period of time, during which every possible edge in the subgraph becomes active often enough, and other dense subgraphs are defined similarly. We bound the number of such maximal dense subgraphs in a temporal c-closed graph that evolves slowly, and thus show that the corresponding enumeration problems admit efficient algorithms; by slow evolution, we mean that between consecutive time-steps, the local change in adjacencies remains small. Our work also adds to a growing body of literature on defining suitable structural parameters for temporal graphs that can be leveraged to design efficient algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Green AI-Native Networks: Evaluation of Neural Circuit Policy for Estimating Energy Consumption of Base Stations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02781v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization of radio hardware and AI-based network management software yield significant energy savings in radio access networks. The execution of underlying Machine Learning (ML) models, which enable energy savings through recommended actions, may require additional compute and energy, highlighting the opportunity to explore and adopt accurate and energy-efficient ML technologies. This work evaluates the novel use of sparsely structured Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs) in a use case to estimate the energy consumption of base stations. Sparsity in ML models yields reduced memory, computation and energy demand, hence facilitating a low-cost and scalable solution. We also evaluate the generalization capability of NCPs in comparison to traditional and widely used ML models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), via quantifying their sensitivity to varying model hyper-parameters (HPs). NCPs demonstrated a clear reduction in computational overhead and energy consumption. Moreover, results indicated that the NCPs are robust to varying HPs such as number of epochs and neurons in each layer, making them a suitable option to ease model management and to reduce energy consumption in Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) in telecommunications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[From Consumption to Collaboration: Measuring Interaction Patterns to Augment Human Cognition in Open-Ended Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02780v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular, is fundamentally changing cognitive processes in knowledge work, raising critical questions about their impact on human reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. As these AI systems become increasingly integrated into workflows, they offer unprecedented opportunities for augmenting human thinking while simultaneously risking cognitive erosion through passive consumption of generated answers. This tension is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks, where effective solutions require deep contextualization and integration of domain knowledge. Unlike structured tasks with established metrics, measuring the quality of human-LLM interaction in such open-ended tasks poses significant challenges due to the absence of ground truth and the iterative nature of solution development. To address this, we present a framework that analyzes interaction patterns along two dimensions: cognitive activity mode (exploration vs. exploitation) and cognitive engagement mode (constructive vs. detrimental). This framework provides systematic measurements to evaluate when LLMs are effective tools for thought rather than substitutes for human cognition, advancing theoretical understanding and practical guidance for developing AI systems that protect and augment human cognitive capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Tools for Thought Workshop (CHI'25)</p></details> |
| **[TailedCore: Few-Shot Sampling for Unsupervised Long-Tail Noisy Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02775v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to solve unsupervised anomaly detection in a practical challenging environment where the normal dataset is both contaminated with defective regions and its product class distribution is tailed but unknown. We observe that existing models suffer from tail-versus-noise trade-off where if a model is robust against pixel noise, then its performance deteriorates on tail class samples, and vice versa. To mitigate the issue, we handle the tail class and noise samples independently. To this end, we propose TailSampler, a novel class size predictor that estimates the class cardinality of samples based on a symmetric assumption on the class-wise distribution of embedding similarities. TailSampler can be utilized to sample the tail class samples exclusively, allowing to handle them separately. Based on these facets, we build a memory-based anomaly detection model TailedCore, whose memory both well captures tail class information and is noise-robust. We extensively validate the effectiveness of TailedCore on the unsupervised long-tail noisy anomaly detection setting, and show that TailedCore outperforms the state-of-the-art in most settings.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Online Hybrid-Belief POMDP with Coupled Semantic-Geometric Models and Semantic Safety Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11202v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in complex and unknown environments frequently require geometric-semantic representations of the environment to safely perform their tasks. While inferring the environment, they must account for many possible scenarios when planning future actions. Since objects' class types are discrete and the robot's self-pose and the objects' poses are continuous, the environment can be represented by a hybrid discrete-continuous belief which is updated according to models and incoming data. Prior probabilities and observation models representing the environment can be learned from data using deep learning algorithms. Such models often couple environmental semantic and geometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected, causing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this paper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models and priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables. Within POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining representative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for estimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we develop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample representative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value function and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an explicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show that our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve similar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the entire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief. Nevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than exponential.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Efficient Algorithms for Cardinality Estimation and Conjunctive Query Evaluation With Simple Degree Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02770v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardinality estimation and conjunctive query evaluation are two of the most fundamental problems in database query processing. Recent work proposed, studied, and implemented a robust and practical information-theoretic cardinality estimation framework. In this framework, the estimator is the cardinality upper bound of a conjunctive query subject to ``degree-constraints'', which model a rich set of input data statistics. For general degree constraints, computing this bound is computationally hard. Researchers have naturally sought efficiently computable relaxed upper bounds that are as tight as possible. The polymatroid bound is the tightest among those relaxed upper bounds. While it is an open question whether the polymatroid bound can be computed in polynomial-time in general, it is known to be computable in polynomial-time for some classes of degree constraints. Our focus is on a common class of degree constraints called simple degree constraints. Researchers had not previously determined how to compute the polymatroid bound in polynomial time for this class of constraints. Our first main result is a polynomial time algorithm to compute the polymatroid bound given simple degree constraints. Our second main result is a polynomial-time algorithm to compute a ``proof sequence'' establishing this bound. This proof sequence can then be incorporated in the PANDA-framework to give a faster algorithm to evaluate a conjunctive query. In addition, we show computational limitations to extending our results to broader classes of degree constraints. Finally, our technique leads naturally to a new relaxed upper bound called the {\em flow bound}, which is computationally tractable.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2211.08381</p></details> |
| **[How Deep Do Large Language Models Internalize Scientific Literature and Citation Practices?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02767v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spread of scientific knowledge depends on how researchers discover and cite previous work. The adoption of large language models (LLMs) in the scientific research process introduces a new layer to these citation practices. However, it remains unclear to what extent LLMs align with human citation practices, how they perform across domains, and may influence citation dynamics. Here, we show that LLMs systematically reinforce the Matthew effect in citations by consistently favoring highly cited papers when generating references. This pattern persists across scientific domains despite significant field-specific variations in existence rates, which refer to the proportion of generated references that match existing records in external bibliometric databases. Analyzing 274,951 references generated by GPT-4o for 10,000 papers, we find that LLM recommendations diverge from traditional citation patterns by preferring more recent references with shorter titles and fewer authors. Emphasizing their content-level relevance, the generated references are semantically aligned with the content of each paper at levels comparable to the ground truth references and display similar network effects while reducing author self-citations.

As LLMs become more integrated into the scientific research process, it is important to understand their role in shaping how scientific communities discover and build upon prior work.</p></details> | 32 pages, 17 figures |
| **[On Composable and Parametric Uncertainty in Systems Co-Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02766v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing the design of complex systems requires navigating interdependent decisions, heterogeneous components, and multiple objectives. Our monotone theory of co-design offers a compositional framework for addressing this challenge, modeling systems as Design Problems (DPs), representing trade-offs between functionalities and resources within partially ordered sets. While current approaches model uncertainty using intervals, capturing worst- and best-case bounds, they fail to express probabilistic notions such as risk and confidence. These limitations hinder the applicability of co-design in domains where uncertainty plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for composable uncertainty in co-design, capturing intervals, distributions, and parametrized models. This extension enables reasoning about risk-performance trade-offs and supports advanced queries such as experiment design, learning, and multi-stage decision making. We demonstrate the expressiveness and utility of the framework via a numerical case study on the uncertainty-aware co-design of task-driven Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Scene Splatter: Momentum 3D Scene Generation from Single Image with Video Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02764v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Scene Splatter, a momentum-based paradigm for video diffusion to generate generic scenes from single image. Existing methods, which employ video generation models to synthesize novel views, suffer from limited video length and scene inconsistency, leading to artifacts and distortions during further reconstruction. To address this issue, we construct noisy samples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and maintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception field that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum restricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions. Therefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a pixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better recovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion models to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further finetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render new frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can iteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability and superior performance of our method in high-fidelity and consistent scene generation.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Hybrid lunar ISRU plant: a comparative analysis with carbothermal reduction and water extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04936v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To establish a self-sustained human presence in space and to explore deeper into the solar system, extensive research has been conducted on In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems. Past studies have proposed and researched many technologies to produce oxygen from regolith, such as carbothermal reduction and water extraction from icy regolith, to utilize it for astronauts' life support and as the propellant of space systems. However, determining the most promising technology remains challenging due to uncertainties in the lunar environment and processing methods. To better understand the lunar environment and ISRU operations, it is crucial to gather more information. Motivated by this need for information gathering, this paper proposes a new ISRU plant architecture integrating carbothermal reduction of dry regolith and water extraction from icy regolith. Two different hybrid plant architectures integrating both technologies (1) in parallel and (2) in series are examined. The former involves mining and processing in both a Permanently Shadowed Region (PSR) and a peak of eternal light in parallel, while the latter solely mines in a PSR. In this series hybrid architecture, the dry regolith tailings from water extraction are further processed by carbothermal reduction. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of the landed mass and required power of each plant architecture utilizing subsystem-level models. Furthermore, based on uncertain parameters such as resource content in regolith, the potential performance range of each plant was discovered through Monte Carlo simulations. The result indicates the benefit of the series hybrid architecture in terms of regolith excavation rate, while its mass cost seems the highest among the studied architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables, accepted by Acta Astronautica</p></details> |

| **[Optimal Invariant Bases for Atomistic Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23515v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The representation of atomic configurations for machine learning models has led to the development of numerous descriptors, often to describe the local environment of atoms. However, many of these representations are incomplete and/or functionally dependent. Incomplete descriptor sets are unable to represent all meaningful changes in the atomic environment. Complete constructions of atomic environment descriptors, on the other hand, often suffer from a high degree of functional dependence, where some descriptors can be written as functions of the others. These redundant descriptors do not provide additional power to discriminate between different atomic environments and increase the computational burden. By employing techniques from the pattern recognition literature to existing atomistic representations, we remove descriptors that are functions of other descriptors to produce the smallest possible set that satisfies completeness. We apply this in two ways: first we refine an existing description, the Atomistic Cluster Expansion. We show that this yields a more efficient subset of descriptors. Second, we augment an incomplete construction based on a scalar neural network, yielding a new message-passing network architecture that can recognize up to 5-body patterns in each neuron by taking advantage of an optimal set of Cartesian tensor invariants. This architecture shows strong accuracy on state-of-the-art benchmarks while retaining low computational cost. Our results not only yield improved models, but point the way to classes of invariant bases that minimize cost while maximizing expressivity for a host of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update cross-reference to companion paper</p></details> |
| **[SmartFL: Semantics Based Probabilistic Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23224v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing-based fault localization has been a research focus in software engineering in the past decades. It localizes faulty program elements based on a set of passing and failing test executions. Since whether a fault could be triggered and detected by a test is related to program semantics, it is crucial to model program semantics in fault localization approaches. Existing approaches either consider the full semantics of the program (e.g., mutation-based fault localization and angelic debugging), leading to scalability issues, or ignore the semantics of the program (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization), leading to imprecise localization results. Our key idea is: by modeling only the correctness of program values but not their full semantics, a balance could be reached between effectiveness and scalability. To realize this idea, we introduce a probabilistic model by efficient approximation of program semantics and several techniques to address scalability challenges. Our approach, SmartFL(SeMantics bAsed pRobabilisTic Fault Localization), is evaluated on a real-world dataset, Defects4J 2.0. The top-1 statement-level accuracy of our approach is {14\%}, which improves 130\% over the best SBFL and MBFL methods. The average time cost is {205} seconds per fault, which is half of SBFL methods. After combining our approach with existing approaches using the CombineFL framework, the performance of the combined approach is significantly boosted by an average of 10\% on top-1, top-3, and top-5 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art combination methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering Code: https://github.com/toledosakasa/SMARTFL This update corrects the author's name</p></details> |

The architecture and connectivity of the MI-HGNN are constructed from the robot morphology, in which nodes and edges are robot joints and links, respectively. By incorporating the morphology-informed constraints into a neural network, we improve a learning-based approach using model-based knowledge. We apply the proposed MI-HGNN to two contact perception problems, and conduct extensive experiments using both real-world and simulated data collected using two quadruped robots. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of effectiveness, generalization ability, model efficiency, and sample efficiency. Our MI-HGNN improved the performance of a state-of-the-art model that leverages robot morphological symmetry by 8.4% with only 0.21% of its parameters. Although MI-HGNN is applied to contact perception problems for legged robots in this work, it can be seamlessly applied to other types of multi-body dynamical systems and has the potential to improve other robot learning frameworks.

The first contribution of this paper focuses on characterizing the tails of the so-called normalized generalized gamma (NGG) process. We show that the right tail of an NGG process is heavy-tailed provided that the centering distribution is itself heavy-tailed; the DP is the only member of the NGG class that fails to obey this convenient property. A second contribution of the paper rests on the development of two classes of heavy-tailed mixture models and the assessment of their relative merits. Multivariate extensions of the proposed heavy-tailed mixtures are devised here, along with a predictor-dependent version, to learn about the effect of covariates on a multivariate heavy-tailed response. The simulation study suggests that the proposed method performs well in various scenarios, and we showcase the application of the proposed methods in a neuroscience dataset.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Existing methods to enhance LLM robustness are primarily focused on perturbed data samples, whereas improving resiliency to perturbations of task-level instructions has remained relatively underexplored. In this work, we focus on character- and word-level edits of task-specific instructions, which substantially degrade downstream performance. We experiment with a variety of techniques to enhance the robustness of LLMs, including self-denoising and representation alignment, testing different models (Llama 3 and Flan-T5), datasets (CoLA, QNLI, SST-2) and instructions (both task-oriented and role-oriented). We find that, on average, self-denoising -- whether performed by a frozen LLM or a fine-tuned model -- achieves substantially higher performance gains than alternative strategies, including more complex baselines such as ensembling and supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Build...</summary><p>Building Trust Workshop, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In computer vision domain, Vision Transformer demonstrates remarkable performance on par with or even surpassing that of convolutional neural networks. However, the quadratic computational complexity of its self-attention mechanism poses challenges for classical computing, making model training with high-dimensional input data, e.g., images, particularly expensive. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Quantum Vision Transformer (HQViT), that leverages the principles of quantum computing to accelerate model training while enhancing model performance. HQViT introduces whole-image processing with amplitude encoding to better preserve global image information without additional positional encoding. By leveraging quantum computation on the most critical steps and selectively handling other components in a classical way, we lower the cost of quantum resources for HQViT. The qubit requirement is minimized to $O(log_2N)$ and the number of parameterized quantum gates is only $O(log_2d)$, making it well-suited for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. By offloading the computationally intensive attention coefficient matrix calculation to the quantum framework, HQViT reduces the classical computational load by $O(T^2d)$. Extensive experiments across various computer vision datasets demonstrate that HQViT outperforms existing models, achieving a maximum improvement of up to $10.9\%$ (on the MNIST 10-classification task) over the state of the art. This work highlights the great potential to combine quantum and classical computing to cope with complex image classification tasks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Existing alignment methods often struggle to cover diverse safety scenarios and remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose Ex-Ante Reasoning Preference Optimization (ERPO), a novel safety alignment framework that equips LLMs with explicit preemptive reasoning through Chain-of-Thought and provides clear evidence for safety judgments by embedding predefined safety rules. Specifically, our approach consists of three stages: first, equipping the model with Ex-Ante reasoning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a constructed reasoning module; second, enhancing safety, usefulness, and efficiency via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); and third, mitigating inference latency with a length-controlled iterative preference optimization strategy. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs demonstrate that ERPO significantly enhances safety performance while maintaining response efficiency.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the dynamical metastability of the system.</p></details> | 28 pages, 4 figures |

This work introduces IMPACT (Image Metric with Pretrained model-Agnostic Comparison for Transmodality registration), a novel similarity metric designed for robust multimodal image registration. Rather than relying on raw intensities, handcrafted descriptors, or task-specific training, IMPACT defines a semantic similarity measure based on the comparison of deep features extracted from large-scale pretrained segmentation models. By leveraging representations from models such as TotalSegmentator, Segment Anything (SAM), and other foundation networks, IMPACT provides a task-agnostic, training-free solution that generalizes across imaging modalities. These features, originally trained for segmentation, offer strong spatial correspondence and semantic alignment capabilities, making them naturally suited for registration. The method integrates seamlessly into both algorithmic (Elastix) and learning-based (VoxelMorph) frameworks, leveraging the strengths of each. IMPACT was evaluated on five challenging 3D registration tasks involving thoracic CT/CBCT and pelvic MR/CT datasets. Quantitative metrics, including Target Registration Error and Dice Similarity Coefficient, demonstrated consistent improvements in anatomical alignment over baseline methods. Qualitative analyses further highlighted the robustness of the proposed metric in the presence of noise, artifacts, and modality variations. With its versatility, efficiency, and strong performance across diverse tasks, IMPACT offers a powerful solution for advancing multimodal image registration in both clinical and research settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI).

Traditional methods, such as scaling model parameters or retraining on domain-specific corpora, are computationally expensive and yield diminishing returns, while existing approaches like retrieval-augmented generation, mixture of experts, and fine-tuning struggle with accuracy, efficiency, and coordination. To address this issue, we propose Telecom mixture of models (TeleMoM), a consensus-driven ensemble framework that integrates multiple LLMs for enhanced decision-making in Telecom. TeleMoM employs a two-stage process: proponent models generate justified responses, and an adjudicator finalizes decisions, supported by a quality-checking mechanism. This approach leverages strengths of diverse models to improve accuracy, reduce biases, and handle domain-specific complexities effectively. Evaluation results demonstrate that TeleMoM achieves a 9.7\% increase in answer accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness in Telecom applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; submitted to 2025 IEEE VTC Fall</p></details> |

This raises the question of whether Transformer models are real reasoning engines, despite their impressive abilities in mathematical problem solving and code synthesis. In this paper, we offer a vanishing variance perspective on this issue. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that even for today's frontier models, a longer sequence length results in a decrease in variance in the output of the multi-head attention modules. On the argmax retrieval and dictionary lookup tasks, our experiments show that applying layer normalization after the attention outputs leads to significantly better length generalization. Our analyses attribute this improvement to a reduction-though not a complete elimination-of the distribution shift caused by vanishing variance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ruiningli.com/vanishing-variance.

However, existing methods encode all shapes into a fixed-size token, disregarding the inherent variations in scale and complexity across 3D data. This leads to inefficient latent representations that can compromise downstream generation. We address this challenge by introducing Octree-based Adaptive Tokenization, a novel framework that adjusts the dimension of latent representations according to shape complexity. Our approach constructs an adaptive octree structure guided by a quadric-error-based subdivision criterion and allocates a shape latent vector to each octree cell using a query-based transformer. Building upon this tokenization, we develop an octree-based autoregressive generative model that effectively leverages these variable-sized representations in shape generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces token counts by 50% compared to fixed-size methods while maintaining comparable visual quality. When using a similar token length, our method produces significantly higher-quality shapes. When incorporated with our downstream generative model, our method creates more detailed and diverse 3D content than existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://oat-3d.github.io/</p></details> |

However, when these models are deployed in high-stakes verticals such as healthcare, education, and law, they often reveal notable limitations. For instance, they exhibit brittleness to minor variations in input data, present contextually uninformed decisions in critical settings, and undermine user trust by confidently producing or reproducing inaccuracies. These challenges in applying large models necessitate cross-disciplinary innovations to align the models' capabilities with the needs of real-world applications. We introduce a framework that addresses this gap through a layer-wise abstraction of innovations aimed at meeting users' requirements with large models. Through multiple case studies, we illustrate how researchers and practitioners across various fields can operationalize this framework. Beyond modularizing the pipeline of transforming large models into useful "vertical systems", we also highlight the dynamism that exists within different layers of the framework. Finally, we discuss how our framework can guide researchers and practitioners to (i) optimally situate their innovations (e.g., when vertical-specific insights can empower broadly impactful vertical-agnostic innovations), (ii) uncover overlooked opportunities (e.g., spotting recurring problems across verticals to develop practically useful foundation models instead of chasing benchmarks), and (iii) facilitate cross-disciplinary communication of critical challenges (e.g., enabling a shared vocabulary for AI developers, domain experts, and human-computer interaction scholars).</p></details> | <details><summary>pre-p...</summary><p>pre-print; 7 pages of main content, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

This dataset is made up of predominantly religious data (from the Bible and texts from the Jehovah's Witnesses), but also a small amount of general domain data (from a dictionary). This mirrors the typical resource availability of many low resource languages. We train a number of transformer-based models to investigate how to improve domain transfer from religious data to a more general domain. We find that adding even 300 sentences from the target domain when training substantially improves the translation performance, highlighting the importance and need for data collection for low-resource languages, even on a small-scale. We additionally find that Portuguese-to-Kiriol translation models perform better on average than other source and target language pairs, and investigate how this relates to the morphological complexity of the languages involved and the degree of lexical overlap between creoles and lexifiers. Overall, we hope our work will stimulate research into Kiriol and into how machine translation might better support creole languages in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables.

Modern neural networks have outstanding ability in modeling complex time series. Self-supervised models in particular tackle unsupervised TSAD by transforming the input via various augmentations to create pseudo anomalies for training. However, their performance is sensitive to the choice of augmentation, which is hard to choose in practice, while there exists no effort in the literature on data augmentation tuning for TSAD without labels. Our work aims to fill this gap. We introduce TSAP for TSA "on autoPilot", which can (self-)tune augmentation hyperparameters end-to-end. It stands on two key components: a differentiable augmentation architecture and an unsupervised validation loss to effectively assess the alignment between augmentation type and anomaly type. Case studies show TSAP's ability to effectively select the (discrete) augmentation type and associated (continuous) hyperparameters. In turn, it outperforms established baselines, including SOTA self-supervised models, on diverse TSAD tasks exhibiting different anomaly types.</p></details> | Accepted at SDM 2025 |

The resulting transform space generalizes classical approaches such as wavelets and Radon transforms by incorporating parameters of refinement multiplicity, dispersion, and rotation. We rigorously establish key properties of the transform including completeness, uniqueness, invertibility, closure, and stability using frame bounds over functions of bounded variation and define a natural inner product structure emerging in L2. We identify regions of parameter space that recover known transforms, including multiscale wavelet decompositions and the generalized Radon transform. Applications are discussed across a range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on entropy formulations. Notably, the transform remains well behaved on geometrically complex and even non convex domains, where traditional methods may struggle.

| **[Data-Driven Neural Certificate Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05510v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of verifying different properties of discrete time dynamical systems, namely, reachability, safety and reach-while-avoid. To achieve this, we adopt a data driven perspective and using past systems' trajectories as data, we aim at learning a specific function termed \emph{certificate} for each property we wish to verify. The certificate construction problem is treated as a safety informed neural network training process, where we use a neural network to learn the parameterization of each certificate, while the loss function we seek to minimize is designed to encompass conditions on the certificate to be learned that encode the satisfaction of the associated property. Besides learning a certificate, we quantify probabilistically its generalization properties, namely, how likely it is for a certificate to be valid (and hence for the associated property to be satisfied) when it comes to a new system trajectory not included in the training data set. We view this problem under the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning under the notion of compression, and use recent advancements of the so-called scenario approach to obtain scalable generalization bounds on the learned certificates. To achieve this, we design a novel algorithm that minimizes the loss function and hence constructs a certificate, and at the same time determines a quantity termed compression, which is instrumental in obtaining meaningful probabilistic guarantees. This process is novel per se and provides a constructive mechanism for compression set calculation, thus opening the road for its use to more general non-convex optimization problems. We verify the efficacy of our methodology on several numerical case studies, and compare it (both theoretically and numerically) with closely related results on data-driven property verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, submitted to Automatica</p></details> |

Troubled by flexibility-quality tradeoffs, existing methods are often limited to using predefined structures or retrieving shapes from static datasets. To address these challenges, we parameterize an articulated object as a tree of tokens and employ a transformer to generate both the object's high-level geometry code and its kinematic relations. Subsequently, each sub-part's geometry is further decoded using a signed-distance-function (SDF) shape prior, facilitating the synthesis of high-quality 3D shapes. Our approach enables the generation of diverse objects with high-quality geometry and varying number of parts. Comprehensive experiments on conditional generation from text descriptions demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025. impl. repo: https://github.com/ShuYuMo2003/ArtFormer</p></details> |

Within the realm of music recommendation, graphs play a crucial role in enhancing genre-based recommendations by integrating Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with advanced graph embeddings. This study explores the efficacy of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Transformer (GT) models in learning embeddings that effectively capture intricate relationships between music items and genres represented within graph structures. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world music datasets, our findings consistently demonstrate that these graph-based approaches outperform traditional methods that rely solely on MFCC features or collaborative filtering techniques. Specifically, the graph-enhanced models achieve notably higher accuracy in predicting genre-specific preferences and offering relevant music suggestions to users. These results underscore the effectiveness of utilizing graph embeddings to enrich feature representations and exploit latent associations within music data, thereby illustrating their potential to advance the capabilities of personalized and context-aware music recommendation systems.

However, CT-based prediction faces two major challenges: the high computational complexity of transformer-based architectures, which limits their deployment in portable and clinical settings, and the imbalanced, long-tailed distribution of real-world hospital data that skews predictions. To address these issues, we introduce MedConv, a convolutional model for bone density prediction that outperforms transformer models with lower computational demands. We also adapt Bal-CE loss and post-hoc logit adjustment to improve class balance. Extensive experiments on our AustinSpine dataset shows that our approach achieves up to 21% improvement in accuracy and 20% in ROC AUC over previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

However, the performance of learned bi-directional video compression (LBVC) still lags behind traditional bi-directional coding. The performance gap mainly arises from inaccurate long-term motion estimation and prediction of distant frames, especially in large motion scenes. To solve these two critical problems, this paper proposes a novel LBVC framework, namely L-LBVC. Firstly, we propose an adaptive motion estimation module that can handle both short-term and long-term motions. Specifically, we directly estimate the optical flows for adjacent frames and non-adjacent frames with small motions. For non-adjacent frames with large motions, we recursively accumulate local flows between adjacent frames to estimate long-term flows. Secondly, we propose an adaptive motion prediction module that can largely reduce the bit cost for motion coding. To improve the accuracy of long-term motion prediction, we adaptively downsample reference frames during testing to match the motion ranges observed during training. Experiments show that our L-LBVC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art LVC methods and even surpasses VVC (VTM) on some test datasets under random access configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Data Compression Conference (DCC)</p></details> |
| **[A Sensorimotor Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02536v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Sensorimotor Transformer (SMT), a vision model inspired by human saccadic eye movements that prioritize high-saliency regions in visual input to enhance computational efficiency and reduce memory consumption. Unlike traditional models that process all image patches uniformly, SMT identifies and selects the most salient patches based on intrinsic two-dimensional (i2D) features, such as corners and occlusions, which are known to convey high-information content and align with human fixation patterns. The SMT architecture uses this biological principle to leverage vision transformers to process only the most informative patches, allowing for a substantial reduction in memory usage that scales with the sequence length of selected patches. This approach aligns with visual neuroscience findings, suggesting that the human visual system optimizes information gathering through selective, spatially dynamic focus. Experimental evaluations on Imagenet-1k demonstrate that SMT achieves competitive top-1 accuracy while significantly reducing memory consumption and computational complexity, particularly when a limited number of patches is used. This work introduces a saccade-like selection mechanism into transformer-based vision models, offering an efficient alternative for image analysis and providing new insights into biologically motivated architectures for resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, CT multi-organ segmentation methods based on masked image modeling (MIM) are very limited. There are already methods using MAE for CT multi-organ segmentation task, we believe that the existing methods do not identify the most difficult areas to reconstruct. To this end, we propose a MIM self-training framework with hard patches mining masked autoencoders for CT multi-organ segmentation tasks (selfMedHPM). The method performs ViT self-pretraining on the training set of the target data and introduces an auxiliary loss predictor, which first predicts the patch loss and determines the location of the next mask. SelfMedHPM implementation is better than various competitive methods in abdominal CT multi-organ segmentation and body CT multi-organ segmentation. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for abdomen mult-organ segmentation and the SinoMed Whole Body (SMWB) dataset for body multi-organ segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2304.05919 by other authors</p></details> |

Consequently, ViTs are typically trained on small, fixed-size images obtained through downscaling or cropping. While reducing computational burden, these methods result in significant information loss, negatively affecting tasks like image aesthetic assessment. We introduce Charm, a novel tokenization approach that preserves Composition, High-resolution, Aspect Ratio, and Multi-scale information simultaneously. Charm prioritizes high-resolution details in specific regions while downscaling others, enabling shorter fixed-size input sequences for ViTs while incorporating essential information. Charm is designed to be compatible with pre-trained ViTs and their learned positional embeddings. By providing multiscale input and introducing variety to input tokens, Charm improves ViT performance and generalizability for image aesthetic assessment. We avoid cropping or changing the aspect ratio to further preserve information. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements on various image aesthetic and quality assessment datasets (up to 8.1 %) using a lightweight ViT backbone.

While various PDF parsing tools exist, their effectiveness across different document types remains understudied, especially beyond academic papers. Our research aims to address this gap by comparing 10 popular PDF parsing tools across 6 document categories using the DocLayNet dataset. These tools include PyPDF, pdfminer-six, PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, pypdfium2, Unstructured, Tabula, Camelot, as well as the deep learning-based tools Nougat and Table Transformer(TATR).

For these challenging categories, learning-based tools like Nougat demonstrated superior performance. In table detection, TATR excelled in the Financial, Patent, Law & Regulations, and Scientific categories. Table detection tool Camelot performed best for tender documents, while PyMuPDF performed superior in the Manual category.

Despite their remarkable performance, they often suffer significant accuracy drops when quantized for practical deployment, particularly by post-training quantization (PTQ) under ultra-low bits. Recently, reconstruction-based PTQ methods have shown promising performance in quantizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, they fail when applied to ViTs, primarily due to the inaccurate estimation of output importance and the substantial accuracy degradation in quantizing post-GELU activations. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{APHQ-ViT}, a novel PTQ approach based on importance estimation with Average Perturbation Hessian (APH). Specifically, we first thoroughly analyze the current approximation approaches with Hessian loss, and propose an improved average perturbation Hessian loss. To deal with the quantization of the post-GELU activations, we design an MLP Reconstruction (MR) method by replacing the GELU function in MLP with ReLU and reconstructing it by the APH loss on a small unlabeled calibration set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APHQ-ViT using linear quantizers outperforms existing PTQ methods by substantial margins in 3-bit and 4-bit across different vision tasks.

Notably, the decision transformer (DT) architecture has shown promise across various domains. However, despite its initial success, DTs have underperformed on several challenging datasets in goal-conditioned RL. This limitation stems from the inefficiency of return conditioning for guiding policy learning, particularly in unstructured and suboptimal datasets, resulting in DTs failing to effectively learn temporal compositionality. Moreover, this problem might be further exacerbated in long-horizon sparse-reward tasks. To address this challenge, we propose the Predictive Coding for Decision Transformer (PCDT) framework, which leverages generalized future conditioning to enhance DT methods. PCDT utilizes an architecture that extends the DT framework, conditioned on predictive codings, enabling decision-making based on both past and future factors, thereby improving generalization. Through extensive experiments on eight datasets from the AntMaze and FrankaKitchen environments, our proposed method achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing popular value-based and transformer-based methods in offline goal-conditioned RL. Furthermore, we also evaluate our method on a goal-reaching task with a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, IROS 2024.

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), an advanced extension of the Internet of Things (IoT) tailored for the medical field, offers a transformative solution for delivering medical care. IoMT consists of interconnected medical devices that collect and transmit patients' vital signs online. This data can be analyzed to identify potential health issues, support medical decision-making, enhance patient outcomes, and streamline healthcare operations. Additionally, IoMT helps individuals make informed decisions about their health and fitness. There is a natural synergy with emerging communication technologies to ensure the secure and timely transmission of medical data. This paper presents the first comprehensive tutorial on cutting-edge IoMT research focusing on wireless communication-based solutions. It introduces a systematic three-tier framework to analyze IoMT networks and identify application scenarios. The paper examines the medical data transmission process, including intra-wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), inter-WBAN, and beyond-WBAN communications. It also discusses the challenges of implementing IoMT applications, such as the longevity of biosensors, co-channel interference management, information security, and data processing delays.

It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.</p></details> | 37 pages, 9 figures |

In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and news, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, research on text-driven talking heads remains underexplored, with existing methods predominantly adopting a cascaded pipeline that combines TTS systems with audio-driven talking head models. This conventional pipeline not only introduces system complexity and latency overhead but also fundamentally suffers from asynchronous audiovisual output and stylistic discrepancies between generated speech and visual expressions. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniTalker, an end-to-end unified framework that simultaneously generates synchronized speech and talking head videos from text and reference video in real-time zero-shot scenarios, while preserving both speech style and facial styles. The framework employs a dual-branch diffusion transformer architecture: the audio branch synthesizes mel-spectrograms from text, while the visual branch predicts fine-grained head poses and facial dynamics. To bridge modalities, we introduce a novel audio-visual fusion module that integrates cross-modal information to ensure temporal synchronization and stylistic coherence between audio and visual outputs. Furthermore, our in-context reference learning module effectively captures both speech and facial style characteristics from a single reference video without introducing an extra style extracting module. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker presents the first unified framework that jointly models speech style and facial style in a zero-shot setting, achieving real-time inference speed of 25 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in generation quality, particularly excelling in style preservation and audio-video synchronization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> |

We propose a scalable, non-iterative algorithm that efficiently recovers the underlying low-rank structure in the presence of row-wise adversarial corruption. By first compressing the data with a Johnson Lindenstrauss projection, our approach preserves the geometry of clean rows while dramatically reducing dimensionality. Robust statistical techniques based on the median and median absolute deviation then enable precise identification and removal of outlier rows with abnormally high norms. The subsequent rank-k approximation achieves near-optimal error bounds with a one pass procedure that scales linearly with the number of observations. Empirical results confirm that combining random sketches with robust statistics yields efficient, accurate decompositions even in the presence of large fractions of corrupted rows.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 9 figures, preprint</p></details> |

However, it has limitations, particularly in the third trimester, where the complexity of the fetal brain requires high image quality for extracting quantitative data. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior image quality and tissue differentiation but is less available, expensive, and requires time-consuming acquisition. Thus, transforming ultrasonic images into an MRI-mimicking display may be advantageous and allow better tissue anatomy presentation. To address this goal, we have examined the use of artificial intelligence, implementing a diffusion model renowned for generating high-quality images. The proposed method, termed "Dual Diffusion Imposed Correlation" (DDIC), leverages a diffusion-based translation methodology, assuming a shared latent space between ultrasound and MRI domains. Model training was obtained utilizing the "HC18" dataset for ultrasound and the "CRL fetal brain atlas" along with the "FeTA " datasets for MRI. The generated pseudo-MRI images provide notable improvements in visual discrimination of brain tissue, especially in the lateral ventricles and the Sylvian fissure, characterized by enhanced contrast clarity. Improvement was demonstrated in Mutual information, Peak signal-to-noise ratio, Fr\'echet Inception Distance, and Contrast-to-noise ratio. Findings from these evaluations indicate statistically significant superior performance of the DDIC compared to other translation methodologies. In addition, a Medical Opinion Test was obtained from 5 gynecologists. The results demonstrated display improvement in 81% of the tested images. In conclusion, the presented pseudo-MRI images hold the potential for streamlining diagnosis and enhancing clinical outcomes through improved representation.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Quantum singular value transformation without block encodings: Near-optimal complexity with minimal ancilla](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02385v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop new algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework underlying a wide range of quantum algorithms. Existing implementations of QSVT rely on block encoding, incurring $O(\log L)$ ancilla overhead and circuit depth $\widetilde{O}(d\lambda L)$ for polynomial transformations of a Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{k=1}^L \lambda_k H_k$, where $d$ is polynomial degree, and $\lambda=\sum_k |\lambda_k|$. We introduce a new approach that eliminates block encoding, needs only a single ancilla qubit, and maintains near-optimal complexity, using only basic Hamiltonian simulation methods such as Trotterization. Our method achieves a circuit depth of $\widetilde{O}(L(d\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}})^{1+o(1)})$, without any multi-qubit controlled gates. Here, $\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}}$ depends on the nested commutators of the $H_k$'s and can be much smaller than $\lambda$. Central to our technique is a novel use of Richardson extrapolation, enabling systematic error cancellation in interleaved sequences of arbitrary unitaries and Hamiltonian evolution operators, establishing a broadly applicable framework beyond QSVT. Additionally, we propose two randomized QSVT algorithms for cases with only sampling access to Hamiltonian terms. The first uses qDRIFT, while the second replaces block encodings in QSVT with randomly sampled unitaries. Both achieve quadratic complexity in $d$, which we establish as a lower bound for any randomized method implementing polynomial transformations in this model. Finally, as applications, we develop end-to-end quantum algorithms for quantum linear systems and ground state property estimation, achieving near-optimal complexity without oracular access. Our results provide a new framework for quantum algorithms, reducing hardware overhead while maintaining near-optimal performance, with implications for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p></details> | 91 pages, 2 figures |

However, most existing methods either disregard the removal of potential compression artifacts during the enhancement process or fail to establish a unified framework for joint task enhancement of images with varying compression qualities. To solve this problem, we propose the hybrid priors-guided network (HPGN), which enhances compressed low-light images by integrating both compression and illumination priors. Our approach fully utilizes the JPEG quality factor (QF) and DCT quantization matrix (QM) to guide the design of efficient joint task plug-and-play modules. Additionally, we employ a random QF generation strategy to guide model training, enabling a single model to enhance images across different compression levels. Experimental results confirm the superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we explore the applications of reinforcement fine-tuning to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer (arXiv:2403.15734) using discriminative machine learning models such as interatomic potentials and property prediction models. By optimizing reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material property figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning enables not only the property-guided novel material design ability of generative pre-trained model but also unlocks property-driven material retrieval from the unsupervised pre-training dataset. Leveraging rewards from discriminative models to fine-tune materials generative models opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Specifically, current AI models exhibit substantial performance degradation in dynamic environments with varying data distributions, and the black-box nature of these algorithms raises concerns regarding safety, transparency, and fairness. This presents a major challenge in integrating AI into practical communication systems. Recently, a novel type of neural network, known as the liquid neural networks (LNNs), has been designed from first principles to address these issues. In this paper, we explore the potential of LNNs in telecommunications. First, we illustrate the mechanisms of LNNs and highlight their unique advantages over traditional networks. Then we unveil the opportunities that LNNs bring to future wireless networks. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and design directions for the implementation of LNNs. Finally, we summarize the performance of LNNs in two case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures. Accepted by ZTE Communications</p></details> |

| **[Concept Lancet: Image Editing with Compositional Representation Transplant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02828v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely used for image editing tasks. Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary. Experiments on multiple diffusion-based image editing baselines show that methods equipped with CoLan achieve state-of-the-art performance in editing effectiveness and consistency preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

| **[Online Hybrid-Belief POMDP with Coupled Semantic-Geometric Models and Semantic Safety Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11202v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in complex and unknown environments frequently require geometric-semantic representations of the environment to safely perform their tasks. While inferring the environment, they must account for many possible scenarios when planning future actions. Since objects' class types are discrete and the robot's self-pose and the objects' poses are continuous, the environment can be represented by a hybrid discrete-continuous belief which is updated according to models and incoming data. Prior probabilities and observation models representing the environment can be learned from data using deep learning algorithms. Such models often couple environmental semantic and geometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected, causing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this paper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models and priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables. Within POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining representative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for estimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we develop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample representative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value function and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an explicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show that our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve similar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the entire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief. Nevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than exponential.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Sequential Binary Hypothesis Testing with Competing Agents under Information Asymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02743v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper concerns sequential hypothesis testing in competitive multi-agent systems where agents exchange potentially manipulated information. Specifically, a two-agent scenario is studied where each agent aims to correctly infer the true state of nature while optimizing decision speed and accuracy. At each iteration, agents collect private observations, update their beliefs, and share (possibly corrupted) belief signals with their counterparts before deciding whether to stop and declare a state, or continue gathering more information. The analysis yields three main results: (1)~when agents share information strategically, the optimal signaling policy involves equal-probability randomization between truthful and inverted beliefs; (2)~agents maximize performance by relying solely on their own observations for belief updating while using received information only to anticipate their counterpart's stopping decision; and (3)~the agent reaching their confidence threshold first cause the other agent to achieve a higher conditional probability of error. Numerical simulations further demonstrate that agents with higher KL divergence in their conditional distributions gain competitive advantage. Furthermore, our results establish that information sharing -- despite strategic manipulation -- reduces overall system stopping time compared to non-interactive scenarios, which highlights the inherent value of communication even in this competitive setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control 2025</p></details> |

Existing alignment methods often struggle to cover diverse safety scenarios and remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose Ex-Ante Reasoning Preference Optimization (ERPO), a novel safety alignment framework that equips LLMs with explicit preemptive reasoning through Chain-of-Thought and provides clear evidence for safety judgments by embedding predefined safety rules. Specifically, our approach consists of three stages: first, equipping the model with Ex-Ante reasoning through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a constructed reasoning module; second, enhancing safety, usefulness, and efficiency via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); and third, mitigating inference latency with a length-controlled iterative preference optimization strategy. Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs demonstrate that ERPO significantly enhances safety performance while maintaining response efficiency.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Retrieving Semantics from the Deep: an RAG Solution for Gesture Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06786v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-verbal communication often comprises of semantically rich gestures that help convey the meaning of an utterance. Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches. The reader is urged to explore the results on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Learning Phase Distortion with Selective State Space Models for Video Turbulence Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02697v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Atmospheric turbulence is a major source of image degradation in long-range imaging systems. Although numerous deep learning-based turbulence mitigation (TM) methods have been proposed, many are slow, memory-hungry, and do not generalize well. In the spatial domain, methods based on convolutional operators have a limited receptive field, so they cannot handle a large spatial dependency required by turbulence. In the temporal domain, methods relying on self-attention can, in theory, leverage the lucky effects of turbulence, but their quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale to many frames. Traditional recurrent aggregation methods face parallelization challenges. In this paper, we present a new TM method based on two concepts: (1) A turbulence mitigation network based on the Selective State Space Model (MambaTM). MambaTM provides a global receptive field in each layer across spatial and temporal dimensions while maintaining linear computational complexity. (2) Learned Latent Phase Distortion (LPD). LPD guides the state space model. Unlike classical Zernike-based representations of phase distortion, the new LPD map uniquely captures the actual effects of turbulence, significantly improving the model's capability to estimate degradation by reducing the ill-posedness. Our proposed method exceeds current state-of-the-art networks on various synthetic and real-world TM benchmarks with significantly faster inference speed. The code is available at http://github.com/xg416/MambaTM.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, project page: https://xg416.github.io/MambaTM/</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Large Language Models, a survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23037v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://askeplaat.github.io/agentic-llm-survey-site/</p></details> |
| **[Incorporating the ChEES Criterion into Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02627v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a powerful but computationally expensive way of performing non-parametric Bayesian inference. MCMC proposals which utilise gradients, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), can better explore the parameter space of interest if the additional hyper-parameters are chosen well. The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is a variant of HMC which is extremely effective at selecting these hyper-parameters but is slow to run and is not suited to GPU architectures. An alternative to NUTS, Change in the Estimator of the Expected Square HMC (ChEES-HMC) was shown not only to run faster than NUTS on GPU but also sample from posteriors more efficiently. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are another sampling method which instead output weighted samples from the posterior. They are very amenable to parallelisation and therefore being run on GPUs while having additional flexibility in their choice of proposal over MCMC. We incorporate (ChEEs-HMC) as a proposal into SMC samplers and demonstrate competitive but faster performance than NUTS on a number of tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Efficient Model Editing with Task-Localized Sparse Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02620v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic has emerged as a promising approach for editing models by representing task-specific knowledge as composable task vectors. However, existing methods rely on network linearization to derive task vectors, leading to computational bottlenecks during training and inference. Moreover, linearization alone does not ensure weight disentanglement, the key property that enables conflict-free composition of task vectors. To address this, we propose TaLoS which allows to build sparse task vectors with minimal interference without requiring explicit linearization and sharing information across tasks. We find that pre-trained models contain a subset of parameters with consistently low gradient sensitivity across tasks, and that sparsely updating only these parameters allows for promoting weight disentanglement during fine-tuning. Our experiments prove that TaLoS improves training and inference efficiency while outperforming current methods in task addition and negation. By enabling modular parameter editing, our approach fosters practical deployment of adaptable foundation models in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ICLR 2025 - https://github.com/iurada/talos-task-arithmetic</p></details> |
| **[VideoScene: Distilling Video Diffusion Model to Generate 3D Scenes in One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01956v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging task due to its inherent ill-posed problem. Conventional methods have developed specialized solutions (e.g., geometry regularization or feed-forward deterministic model) to mitigate the issue. However, they still suffer from performance degradation by minimal overlap across input views with insufficient visual information. Fortunately, recent video generative models show promise in addressing this challenge as they are capable of generating video clips with plausible 3D structures. Powered by large pretrained video diffusion models, some pioneering research start to explore the potential of video generative prior and create 3D scenes from sparse views. Despite impressive improvements, they are limited by slow inference time and the lack of 3D constraint, leading to inefficiencies and reconstruction artifacts that do not align with real-world geometry structure. In this paper, we propose VideoScene to distill the video diffusion model to generate 3D scenes in one step, aiming to build an efficient and effective tool to bridge the gap from video to 3D. Specifically, we design a 3D-aware leap flow distillation strategy to leap over time-consuming redundant information and train a dynamic denoising policy network to adaptively determine the optimal leap timestep during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VideoScene achieves faster and superior 3D scene generation results than previous video diffusion models, highlighting its potential as an efficient tool for future video to 3D applications.

| **[Reasoning Inconsistencies and How to Mitigate Them in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02577v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in Deep Learning models and techniques have led to significant strides in performance across diverse tasks and modalities. However, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our understanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited, particularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of logical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as contradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous conclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning discrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal procedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity of the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these errors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or logically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing novel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs, natural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for detecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque internal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To mitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a data efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a synthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the thesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning tasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful and interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference. Critically, this thesis provides a comprehensive framework to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of deep learning models across diverse tasks and modalities.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Efficient LLM Inference using Dynamic Input Pruning and Cache-Aware Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01380v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While mobile devices provide ever more compute power, improvements in DRAM bandwidth are much slower. This is unfortunate for large language model (LLM) token generation, which is heavily memory-bound. Previous work has proposed to leverage natural dynamic activation sparsity in ReLU-activated LLMs to reduce effective DRAM bandwidth per token. However, more recent LLMs use SwiGLU instead of ReLU, which results in little inherent sparsity. While SwiGLU activations can be pruned based on magnitude, the resulting sparsity patterns are difficult to predict, rendering previous approaches ineffective. To circumvent this issue, our work introduces Dynamic Input Pruning (DIP): a predictor-free dynamic sparsification approach, which preserves accuracy with minimal fine-tuning. DIP can further use lightweight LoRA adapters to regain some performance lost during sparsification. Lastly, we describe a novel cache-aware masking strategy, which considers the cache state and activation magnitude to further increase cache hit rate, improving LLM token rate on mobile devices. DIP outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy, memory and throughput trade-offs across simulated hardware settings. On Phi-3-Medium, DIP achieves a 46\% reduction in memory and 40\% increase in throughput with $<$ 0.1 loss in perplexity when compared to streaming the dense model from Flash.

However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that $\textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}$. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the $\textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}$, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in $\textbf{DeepSeek-GRM}$ models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review. 42 pages</p></details> |

When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</p></details> | 49 pages |

In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and news, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, research on text-driven talking heads remains underexplored, with existing methods predominantly adopting a cascaded pipeline that combines TTS systems with audio-driven talking head models. This conventional pipeline not only introduces system complexity and latency overhead but also fundamentally suffers from asynchronous audiovisual output and stylistic discrepancies between generated speech and visual expressions. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniTalker, an end-to-end unified framework that simultaneously generates synchronized speech and talking head videos from text and reference video in real-time zero-shot scenarios, while preserving both speech style and facial styles. The framework employs a dual-branch diffusion transformer architecture: the audio branch synthesizes mel-spectrograms from text, while the visual branch predicts fine-grained head poses and facial dynamics. To bridge modalities, we introduce a novel audio-visual fusion module that integrates cross-modal information to ensure temporal synchronization and stylistic coherence between audio and visual outputs. Furthermore, our in-context reference learning module effectively captures both speech and facial style characteristics from a single reference video without introducing an extra style extracting module. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker presents the first unified framework that jointly models speech style and facial style in a zero-shot setting, achieving real-time inference speed of 25 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in generation quality, particularly excelling in style preservation and audio-video synchronization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> |

Recent advances of content enhancement in video analytics offer significant benefits for the bandwidth saving and accuracy improvement. However, existing content-enhanced video analytics systems are excessively computationally expensive and provide extremely low throughput. In this paper, we present region-based content enhancement, that enhances only the important regions in videos, to improve analytical accuracy. Our system, RegenHance, enables high-accuracy and high-throughput video analytics at the edge by 1) a macroblock-based region importance predictor that identifies the important regions fast and precisely, 2) a region-aware enhancer that stitches sparsely distributed regions into dense tensors and enhances them efficiently, and 3) a profile-based execution planer that allocates appropriate resources for enhancement and analytics components. We prototype RegenHance on five heterogeneous edge devices. Experiments on two analytical tasks reveal that region-based enhancement improves the overall accuracy of 10-19% and achieves 2-3x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art frame-based enhancement methods.</p></details> | NSDI'25 |

However, the creation and maintenance of GUI tests for mobile apps are resource-intensive and costly. Recognizing that many apps share similar functionalities, researchers have proposed various techniques to migrate GUI tests from one app to another with similar features. For example, some techniques employ mapping-based approaches to align the GUI elements traversed by the tests of a source app to those present in the target app. Other test migration techniques have also been proposed to leverage large language models (LLMs) by adapting the GUI tasks in source tests. However, these techniques are ineffective in dealing with different operational logic between the source and target apps. The semantics of GUI elements may not be correctly inferred due to the missing analysis of these flows. In this work, we propose REUSEDROID, a novel multiagent framework for GUI test migration empowered by Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). REUSEDROID is powered by multiple VLM-based agents, each tackling a stage of the test migration process by leveraging the relevant visual and textual information embedded in GUI pages. An insight of REUSEDROID is to migrate tests based only on the core logic shared across similar apps, while their entire operational logic could differ. We evaluate REUSEDROID on LinPro, a new test migration dataset that consists of 578 migration tasks for 39 popular apps across 4 categories. The experimental result shows that REUSEDROID can successfully migrate 90.3% of the migration tasks, outperforming the best mapping-based and LLM-based baselines by 318.1% and 109.1%, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Large (Vision) Language Models are Unsupervised In-Context Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02349v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled zero-shot inference, allowing models to solve new tasks without task-specific training. Various adaptation techniques such as prompt engineering, In-Context Learning (ICL), and supervised fine-tuning can further enhance the model's performance on a downstream task, but they require substantial manual effort to construct effective prompts or labeled examples. In this work, we introduce a joint inference framework for fully unsupervised adaptation, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering and labeled examples. Unlike zero-shot inference, which makes independent predictions, the joint inference makes predictions simultaneously for all inputs in a given task. Since direct joint inference involves computationally expensive optimization, we develop efficient approximation techniques, leading to two unsupervised adaptation methods: unsupervised fine-tuning and unsupervised ICL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across diverse tasks and models, including language-only Llama-3.1 on natural language processing tasks, reasoning-oriented Qwen2.5-Math on grade school math problems, vision-language OpenFlamingo on vision tasks, and the API-only access GPT-4o model on massive multi-discipline tasks.

| **[Causal Self-supervised Pretrained Frontend with Predictive Code for Speech Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02302v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech separation (SS) seeks to disentangle a multi-talker speech mixture into single-talker speech streams. Although SS can be generally achieved using offline methods, such a processing paradigm is not suitable for real-time streaming applications. Causal separation models, which rely only on past and present information, offer a promising solution for real-time streaming. However, these models typically suffer from notable performance degradation due to the absence of future context. In this paper, we introduce a novel frontend that is designed to mitigate the mismatch between training and run-time inference by implicitly incorporating future information into causal models through predictive patterns. The pretrained frontend employs a transformer decoder network with a causal convolutional encoder as the backbone and is pretrained in a self-supervised manner with two innovative pretext tasks: autoregressive hybrid prediction and contextual knowledge distillation. These tasks enable the model to capture predictive patterns directly from mixtures in a self-supervised manner. The pretrained frontend subsequently serves as a feature extractor to generate high-quality predictive patterns. Comprehensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets validated the effectiveness of the proposed pretrained frontend.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.03085</p></details> |
| **[Theoretical Insights in Model Inversion Robustness and Conditional Entropy Maximization for Collaborative Inference Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00383v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By locally encoding raw data into intermediate features, collaborative inference enables end users to leverage powerful deep learning models without exposure of sensitive raw data to cloud servers. However, recent studies have revealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve privacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via model inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise corruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters, enhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy empirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive, and the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and inversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that, this work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs given intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the reconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA. Then, we derive a differentiable and solvable measure for bounding this conditional entropy based on the Gaussian mixture estimation and propose a conditional entropy maximization (CEM) algorithm to enhance the inversion robustness. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed CEM; without compromising feature utility and computing efficiency, plugging the proposed CEM into obfuscation-based defense mechanisms consistently boosts their inversion robustness, achieving average gains ranging from 12.9\% to 48.2\%.

| **[Detecting Out-of-Distribution Through the Lens of Neural Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01479v7)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safe deployment; however, existing detectors often struggle to generalize across datasets of varying scales and model architectures, and some can incur high computational costs in real-world applications. Inspired by the phenomenon of Neural Collapse, we propose a versatile and efficient OOD detection method. Specifically, we re-characterize prior observations that in-distribution (ID) samples form clusters, demonstrating that, with appropriate centering, these clusters align closely with model weight vectors. Additionally, we reveal that ID features tend to expand into a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame, explaining the common observation that ID features are situated farther from the origin than OOD features. Incorporating both insights from Neural Collapse, our OOD detector leverages feature proximity to weight vectors and complements this approach by using feature norms to effectively filter out OOD samples. Extensive experiments on off-the-shelf models demonstrate the robustness of our OOD detector across diverse scenarios, mitigating generalization discrepancies and enhancing overall performance, with inference latency comparable to that of the basic softmax-confidence detector.

| **[CodeUpdateArena: Benchmarking Knowledge Editing on API Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06249v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to synthesize and reason about source code. However, the static nature of these models' knowledge does not reflect the fact that libraries and API functions they invoke are continuously evolving, with functionality being added or changing. While numerous benchmarks evaluate how LLMs can generate code, no prior work has studied how an LLMs' knowledge about code API functions can be updated. To fill this gap, we present CodeUpdateArena, a benchmark for knowledge editing in the code domain. An instance in our benchmark consists of a synthetic API function update paired with a program synthesis example that uses the updated functionality; our goal is to update an LLM to be able to solve this program synthesis example without providing documentation of the update at inference time. Compared to knowledge editing for facts encoded in text, success here is more challenging: a code LLM must correctly reason about the semantics of the modified function rather than just reproduce its syntax. Our dataset is constructed by first prompting GPT-4 to generate atomic and executable function updates. Then, for each update, we generate program synthesis examples whose code solutions are prone to use the update. Our benchmark covers updates of various types to 54 functions from seven diverse Python packages, with a total of 670 program synthesis examples. Our experiments show that prepending documentation of the update to open-source code LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek, CodeLlama) does not allow them to incorporate changes for problem solving, and existing knowledge editing techniques also have substantial room for improvement. We hope our benchmark will inspire new methods for knowledge updating in code LLMs.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Re-thinking Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02259v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient understanding of long-form videos remains a significant challenge in computer vision. In this work, we revisit temporal search paradigms for long-form video understanding, studying a fundamental issue pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) long-context vision-language models (VLMs). In particular, our contributions are two-fold: First, we formulate temporal search as a Long Video Haystack problem, i.e., finding a minimal set of relevant frames (typically one to five) among tens of thousands of frames from real-world long videos given specific queries. To validate our formulation, we create LV-Haystack, the first benchmark containing 3,874 human-annotated instances with fine-grained evaluation metrics for assessing keyframe search quality and computational efficiency. Experimental results on LV-Haystack highlight a significant research gap in temporal search capabilities, with SOTA keyframe selection methods achieving only 2.1% temporal F1 score on the LVBench subset. Next, inspired by visual search in images, we re-think temporal searching and propose a lightweight keyframe searching framework, T*, which casts the expensive temporal search as a spatial search problem. T* leverages superior visual localization capabilities typically used in images and introduces an adaptive zooming-in mechanism that operates across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our extensive experiments show that when integrated with existing methods, T* significantly improves SOTA long-form video understanding performance. Specifically, under an inference budget of 32 frames, T* improves GPT-4o's performance from 50.5% to 53.1% and LLaVA-OneVision-72B's performance from 56.5% to 62.4% on LongVideoBench XL subset. Our PyTorch code, benchmark dataset and models are included in the Supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025; A real-world long video needle-in-haystack benchmark; long-video QA with human ref frames</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a memristor-based circuit design for MobileNetV3, specifically for image classification tasks. Our design leverages the low power consumption and high integration density of memristors, making it suitable for edge computing. The architecture includes optimized memristive convolutional modules, batch normalization modules, activation function modules, global average pooling modules, and fully connected modules. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset show that our memristor-based MobileNetV3 achieves over 90% accuracy while significantly reducing inference time and energy consumption compared to traditional implementations. This work demonstrates the potential of memristor-based designs for efficient deployment of deep learning models in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AC-LoRA: Auto Component LoRA for Personalized Artistic Style Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02231v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation allows users to preserve styles or subjects of a provided small set of images for further image generation. With the advancement in large text-to-image models, many techniques have been developed to efficiently fine-tune those models for personalization, such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, LoRA-based methods often face the challenge of adjusting the rank parameter to achieve satisfactory results. To address this challenge, AutoComponent-LoRA (AC-LoRA) is proposed, which is able to automatically separate the signal component and noise component of the LoRA matrices for fast and efficient personalized artistic style image generation. This method is based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and dynamic heuristics to update the hyperparameters during training. Superior performance over existing methods in overcoming model underfitting or overfitting problems is demonstrated. The results were validated using FID, CLIP, DINO, and ImageReward, achieving an average of 9% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, ICCGV 2025, SPIE</p></details> |
| **[Parallelized Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15119v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful approach for visual generation but suffer from slow inference speed due to their sequential token-by-token prediction process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for parallelized autoregressive visual generation that improves generation efficiency while preserving the advantages of autoregressive modeling. Our key insight is that parallel generation depends on visual token dependencies-tokens with weak dependencies can be generated in parallel, while strongly dependent adjacent tokens are difficult to generate together, as their independent sampling may lead to inconsistencies. Based on this observation, we develop a parallel generation strategy that generates distant tokens with weak dependencies in parallel while maintaining sequential generation for strongly dependent local tokens. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into standard autoregressive models without modifying the architecture or tokenizer. Experiments on ImageNet and UCF-101 demonstrate that our method achieves a 3.6x speedup with comparable quality and up to 9.5x speedup with minimal quality degradation across both image and video generation tasks. We hope this work will inspire future research in efficient visual generation and unified autoregressive modeling.

| **[Ridge Leverage Score Sampling for $\ell_p$ Subspace Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03262v3)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The $\ell_p$ subspace approximation problem is an NP-hard low rank approximation problem that generalizes the median hyperplane ($p = 1$), principal component analysis ($p = 2$), and center hyperplane problems ($p = \infty$). A popular approach to cope with the NP-hardness is to compute a strong coreset, which is a weighted subset of input points that simultaneously approximates the cost of every $k$-dimensional subspace, typically to $(1+\epsilon)$ relative error for a small constant $\epsilon$. We obtain an algorithm for constructing a strong coreset for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation of size $\tilde O(k\epsilon^{-4/p})$ for $p<2$ and $\tilde O(k^{p/2}\epsilon^{-p})$ for $p>2$. This offers the following improvements over prior work: - We construct the first strong coresets with nearly optimal dependence on $k$ for all $p\neq 2$. In prior work, [SW18] constructed coresets of modified points with a similar dependence on $k$, while [HV20] constructed true coresets with polynomially worse dependence on $k$. - We recover or improve the best known $\epsilon$ dependence for all $p$. In particular, for $p > 2$, the [SW18] coreset of modified points had a dependence of $\epsilon^{-p^2/2}$ and the [HV20] coreset had a dependence of $\epsilon^{-3p}$. Our algorithm is based on sampling by root ridge leverage scores, which admits fast algorithms, especially for sparse or structured matrices. Our analysis avoids the use of the representative subspace theorem [SW18], which is a critical component of all prior dimension-independent coresets for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation. Our techniques also lead to the first nearly optimal online strong coresets for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation with similar bounds as the offline setting, resolving a problem of [WY23]. All prior approaches lose $\mathrm{poly}(k)$ factors in this setting, even when allowed to modify the original points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantially improves the coreset size bounds over previous versions</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Gibbs states are locally Markovian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02208v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Markov property entails the conditional independence structure inherent in Gibbs distributions for general classical Hamiltonians, a feature that plays a crucial role in inference, mixing time analysis, and algorithm design. However, much less is known about quantum Gibbs states. In this work, we show that for any Hamiltonian with a bounded interaction degree, the quantum Gibbs state is locally Markov at arbitrary temperature, meaning there exists a quasi-local recovery map for every local region. Notably, this recovery map is obtained by applying a detailed-balanced Lindbladian with jumps acting on the region. Consequently, we prove that (i) the conditional mutual information (CMI) for a shielded small region decays exponentially with the shielding distance, and (ii) under the assumption of uniform clustering of correlations, Gibbs states of general non-commuting Hamiltonians on $D$-dimensional lattices can be prepared by a quantum circuit of depth $e^{O(\log^D(n/\epsilon))}$, which can be further reduced assuming certain local gap condition. Our proofs introduce a regularization scheme for imaginary-time-evolved operators at arbitrarily low temperatures and reveal a connection between the Dirichlet form, a dynamic quantity, and the commutator in the KMS inner product, a static quantity. We believe these tools pave the way for tackling further challenges in quantum thermodynamics and mixing times, particularly in low-temperature regimes.</p></details> | 35 pages, 5 figures |
| **[An Investigation into the Causal Mechanism of Political Opinion Dynamics: A Model of Hierarchical Coarse-Graining with Community-Bounded Social Influence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00877v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing polarization in democratic societies is an emergent outcome of political opinion dynamics. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms behind the formation of political opinions, from individual beliefs to collective consensus, remain unknown. Understanding that a causal mechanism must account for both bottom-up and top-down influences, we conceptualize political opinion dynamics as hierarchical coarse-graining, where microscale opinions integrate into a macro-scale state variable. Using the CODA (Continuous Opinions Discrete Actions) model, we simulate Bayesian opinion updating, social identity-based information integration, and migration between social identity groups to represent higher-level connectivity. This results in coarse-graining across micro, meso, and macro levels. Our findings show that higher-level connectivity shapes information integration, yielding three regimes: independent (disconnected, local convergence), parallel (fast, global convergence), and iterative (slow, stepwise convergence). In the iterative regime, low connectivity fosters transient diversity, indicating an informed consensus. In all regimes, time-scale separation leads to downward causation, where agents converge on the aggregate majority choice, driving consensus. Critically, any degree of coherent higher-level information integration can overcome misalignment via global downward causation. The results highlight how emergent properties of the causal mechanism, such as downward causation, are essential for consensus and may inform more precise investigations into polarized political discourse.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a draft of a chapter forthcoming in Computational Social Science of Social Cohesion and Polarization, edited by Marijn Keijzer, Jan Lorenz and Michal Bojanowski</p></details> |

| **[IllumiCraft: Unified Geometry and Illumination Diffusion for Controllable Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03150v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1) high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2) synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues; and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing controllable video generation methods.

| **[Causal Estimation of Tokenisation Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03149v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Spatial Correspondence Across Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03148v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for finding cross-modal space-time correspondences. Given two images from different visual modalities, such as an RGB image and a depth map, our model identifies which pairs of pixels correspond to the same physical points in the scene. To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025. Project link: https://www.ayshrv.com/cmrw .

| **[MERIT: Multilingual Semantic Retrieval with Interleaved Multi-Condition Query](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03144v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; Project Page, Code, and Dataset at: https://merit-2025.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Native-Resolution Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03131v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce native-resolution image synthesis, a novel generative modeling paradigm that enables the synthesis of images at arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional fixed-resolution, square-image methods by natively handling variable-length visual tokens, a core challenge for traditional techniques. To this end, we introduce the Native-resolution diffusion Transformer (NiT), an architecture designed to explicitly model varying resolutions and aspect ratios within its denoising process. Free from the constraints of fixed formats, NiT learns intrinsic visual distributions from images spanning a broad range of resolutions and aspect ratios. Notably, a single NiT model simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both ImageNet-256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks. Surprisingly, akin to the robust zero-shot capabilities seen in advanced large language models, NiT, trained solely on ImageNet, demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization performance. It successfully generates high-fidelity images at previously unseen high resolutions (e.g., 1536 x 1536) and diverse aspect ratios (e.g., 16:9, 3:1, 4:3), as shown in Figure 1. These findings indicate the significant potential of native-resolution modeling as a bridge between visual generative modeling and advanced LLM methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wzdthu.github.io/NiT/</p></details> |
| **[HumanRAM: Feed-forward Human Reconstruction and Animation Model using Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03118v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human reconstruction and animation are long-standing topics in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods typically rely on sophisticated dense-view capture and/or time-consuming per-subject optimization procedures. To address these limitations, we propose HumanRAM, a novel feed-forward approach for generalizable human reconstruction and animation from monocular or sparse human images. Our approach integrates human reconstruction and animation into a unified framework by introducing explicit pose conditions, parameterized by a shared SMPL-X neural texture, into transformer-based large reconstruction models (LRM). Given monocular or sparse input images with associated camera parameters and SMPL-X poses, our model employs scalable transformers and a DPT-based decoder to synthesize realistic human renderings under novel viewpoints and novel poses. By leveraging the explicit pose conditions, our model simultaneously enables high-quality human reconstruction and high-fidelity pose-controlled animation. Experiments show that HumanRAM significantly surpasses previous methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy, animation fidelity, and generalization performance on real-world datasets.

| **[Controllable Human-centric Keyframe Interpolation with Generative Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03119v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing interpolation methods use pre-trained video diffusion priors to generate intermediate frames between sparsely sampled keyframes. In the absence of 3D geometric guidance, these methods struggle to produce plausible results for complex, articulated human motions and offer limited control over the synthesized dynamics. In this paper, we introduce PoseFuse3D Keyframe Interpolator (PoseFuse3D-KI), a novel framework that integrates 3D human guidance signals into the diffusion process for Controllable Human-centric Keyframe Interpolation (CHKI). To provide rich spatial and structural cues for interpolation, our PoseFuse3D, a 3D-informed control model, features a novel SMPL-X encoder that transforms 3D geometry and shape into the 2D latent conditioning space, alongside a fusion network that integrates these 3D cues with 2D pose embeddings. For evaluation, we build CHKI-Video, a new dataset annotated with both 2D poses and 3D SMPL-X parameters. We show that PoseFuse3D-KI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on CHKI-Video, achieving a 9% improvement in PSNR and a 38% reduction in LPIPS. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate that our PoseFuse3D model improves interpolation fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://gseancdat.github.io/projects/PoseFuse3D_KI</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Tree Detection and Segmentation from Aerial Forest Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03114v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale delineation of individual trees from remote sensing imagery is crucial to the advancement of ecological research, particularly as climate change and other environmental factors rapidly transform forest landscapes across the world. Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate, the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts. Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress. We make our code available at: https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/tree-detection-framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/open-forest-observatory/tree-detection-framework</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Continuity of Image Tokens for Cross-domain Few-shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03110v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved remarkable success due to its large-scale pretraining on general domains, but it still faces challenges when applying it to downstream distant domains that have only scarce training data, which gives rise to the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) task. Inspired by Self-Attention's insensitivity to token orders, we find an interesting phenomenon neglected in current works: disrupting the continuity of image tokens (i.e., making pixels not smoothly transited across patches) in ViT leads to a noticeable performance decline in the general (source) domain but only a marginal decrease in downstream target domains. This questions the role of image tokens' continuity in ViT's generalization under large domain gaps. In this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find continuity aids ViT in learning larger spatial patterns, which are harder to transfer than smaller ones, enlarging domain distances. Meanwhile, it implies that only smaller patterns within each patch could be transferred under extreme domain gaps. Based on this interpretation, we further propose a simple yet effective method for CDFSL that better disrupts the continuity of image tokens, encouraging the model to rely less on large patterns and more on smaller ones. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in reducing domain gaps and outperforming state-of-the-art works.

| **[ByteMorph: Benchmarking Instruction-Guided Image Editing with Non-Rigid Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03107v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Editing images with instructions to reflect non-rigid motions, camera viewpoint shifts, object deformations, human articulations, and complex interactions, poses a challenging yet underexplored problem in computer vision. Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence. We further conduct a comprehensive evaluation of recent instruction-based image editing methods from both academic and commercial domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://boese0601.github.io/bytemorph Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/BM-6M Benchmark: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance-Seed/BM-Bench Code: https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/BM-code Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Boese0601/ByteMorph-Demo</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Text Compression: Evaluating Tokenizers Across Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03101v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The choice of tokenizer can profoundly impact language model performance, yet accessible and reliable evaluations of tokenizer quality remain an open challenge. Inspired by scaling consistency, we show that smaller models can accurately predict significant differences in tokenizer impact on larger models at a fraction of the compute cost. By systematically evaluating both English-centric and multilingual tokenizers, we find that tokenizer choice has negligible effects on tasks in English but results in consistent performance differences in multilingual settings. We propose new intrinsic tokenizer metrics inspired by Zipf's law that correlate more strongly with downstream performance than text compression when modeling unseen languages. By combining several metrics to capture multiple aspects of tokenizer behavior, we develop a reliable framework for intrinsic tokenizer evaluations. Our work offers a more efficient path to informed tokenizer selection in future language model development.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[FuseLIP: Multimodal Embeddings via Early Fusion of Discrete Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03096v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language-image pre-training aligns the features of text-image pairs in a common latent space via distinct encoders for each modality. While this approach achieves impressive performance in several zero-shot tasks, it cannot natively handle multimodal inputs, i.e., encoding image and text into a single feature vector. As a remedy, it is common practice to use additional modules to merge the features extracted by the unimodal encoders. In this work, we present FuseLIP, an alternative architecture for multimodal embedding. Leveraging recent progress in discrete image tokenizers, we propose to use a single transformer model which operates on an extended vocabulary of text and image tokens. This early fusion approach allows the different modalities to interact at each depth of encoding and obtain richer representations compared to common late fusion. We collect new datasets for multimodal pre-training and evaluation, designing challenging tasks for multimodal encoder models. We show that FuseLIP outperforms other approaches in multimodal embedding tasks such as VQA and text-guided image transformation retrieval, while being comparable to baselines on unimodal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models available at https://github.com/chs20/fuselip</p></details> |
| **[S4-Driver: Scalable Self-Supervised Driving Multimodal Large Language Modelwith Spatio-Temporal Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24139v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The latest advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have spurred a strong renewed interest in end-to-end motion planning approaches for autonomous driving. Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder. This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations. It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of unannotated driving logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2025; Project website: s4-driver.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Keyed Chaotic Dynamics for Privacy-Preserving Neural Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23655v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network inference typically operates on raw input data, increasing the risk of exposure during preprocessing and inference. Moreover, neural architectures lack efficient built-in mechanisms for directly authenticating input data. This work introduces a novel encryption method for ensuring the security of neural inference. By constructing key-conditioned chaotic graph dynamical systems, we enable the encryption and decryption of real-valued tensors within the neural architecture. The proposed dynamical systems are particularly suited to encryption due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and their capacity to produce complex, key-dependent nonlinear transformations from compact rules. This work establishes a paradigm for securing neural inference and opens new avenues for research on the application of graph dynamical systems in neural network security.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01073v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a critical task in numerous domains, including molecular design and social network analysis, due to its ability to model complex relationships and structured data. While most modern graph generative models utilize adjacency matrix representations, this work revisits an alternative approach that represents graphs as sequences of node set and edge set. We advocate for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, we introduce the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, we explore fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets. Results indicate that G2PT achieves superior generative performance on both generic graph and molecule datasets. Furthermore, G2PT exhibits strong adaptability and versatility in downstream tasks from molecular design to property prediction.

| **[Effective Dual-Region Augmentation for Reduced Reliance on Large Amounts of Labeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13077v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel dual-region augmentation approach designed to reduce reliance on large-scale labeled datasets while improving model robustness and adaptability across diverse computer vision tasks, including source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) and person re-identification (ReID). Our method performs targeted data transformations by applying random noise perturbations to foreground objects and spatially shuffling background patches. This effectively increases the diversity of the training data, improving model robustness and generalization. Evaluations on the PACS dataset for SFDA demonstrate that our augmentation strategy consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements in both single-target and multi-target adaptation settings. By augmenting training data through structured transformations, our method enables model generalization across domains, providing a scalable solution for reducing reliance on manually annotated datasets. Furthermore, experiments on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach for person ReID, surpassing traditional augmentation techniques.

Current alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies (RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[We Should Chart an Atlas of All the World's Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10633v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public model repositories now contain millions of models, yet most models remain undocumented and effectively lost. In this position paper, we advocate for charting the world's model population in a unified structure we call the Model Atlas: a graph that captures models, their attributes, and the weight transformations that connect them. The Model Atlas enables applications in model forensics, meta-ML research, and model discovery, challenging tasks given today's unstructured model repositories. However, because most models lack documentation, large atlas regions remain uncharted. Addressing this gap motivates new machine learning methods that treat models themselves as data, inferring properties such as functionality, performance, and lineage directly from their weights. We argue that a scalable path forward is to bypass the unique parameter symmetries that plague model weights. Charting all the world's models will require a community effort, and we hope its broad utility will rally researchers toward this goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://horwitz.ai/model-atlas</p></details> |
| **[Generalized quantum asymptotic equipartition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04035v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) states that in the limit of a large number of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random experiments, the output sequence is virtually certain to come from the typical set, each member of which is almost equally likely. This property is a form of the law of large numbers and lies at the heart of information theory. In this work, we prove a generalized quantum AEP beyond the i.i.d. framework where the random samples are drawn from two sets of quantum states. In particular, under suitable assumptions on the sets, we prove that all operationally relevant divergences converge to the quantum relative entropy between the sets. More specifically, both the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy (a smoothed form of the min-relative entropy) and the smoothed max-relative entropy approach the regularized relative entropy between the sets. Notably, the asymptotic limit has explicit convergence guarantees and can be efficiently estimated through convex optimization programs, despite the regularization, provided that the sets have efficient descriptions. The generalized AEP directly implies a new generalized quantum Stein's lemma for conducting quantum hypothesis testing between two sets of quantum states. This addresses open questions raised by Brand\~{a}o et al. [IEEE TIT 66(8):5037-5054 (2020)] and Mosonyi et al. [IEEE TIT 68(2):1032-1067 (2022)], which seek a Stein's lemma with computational efficiency. Moreover, we propose a new framework for quantum resource theory in which state transformations are performed without requiring precise characterization of the states being manipulated, making it more robust to imperfections. We demonstrate the reversibility (also referred to as the second law) of such a theory and identify the regularized relative entropy as the unique measure of the resource in this new framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: T...</summary><p>v2: The section "Application 4: efficient bounds for quantum resource theory" moved to a separate paper.

Insights from data and machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11657v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic geometry has a significant effect on the level of turbulent transport in fusion plasmas. Here, we model and analyze this dependence using multiple machine learning methods and a dataset of > 200,000 nonlinear simulations of ion-temperature-gradient turbulence in diverse non-axisymmetric geometries. The dataset is generated using a large collection of both optimized and randomly generated stellarator equilibria. At fixed gradients, the turbulent heat flux varies between geometries by several orders of magnitude. Trends are apparent among the configurations with particularly high or low heat flux. Regression and classification techniques from machine learning are then applied to extract patterns in the dataset. Due to a symmetry of the gyrokinetic equation, the heat flux and regressions thereof should be invariant to translations of the raw features in the parallel coordinate, similar to translation invariance in computer vision applications. Multiple regression models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and decision trees can achieve reasonable predictive power for the heat flux in held-out test configurations, with highest accuracy for the CNNs. Using Spearman correlation, sequential feature selection, and Shapley values to measure feature importance, it is consistently found that the most important geometric lever on the heat flux is the flux surface compression in regions of bad curvature. The second most important feature relates to the magnitude of geodesic curvature. These two features align remarkably with surrogates that have been proposed based on theory, while the methods here allow a natural extension to more features for increased accuracy. The dataset, released with this publication, may also be used to test other proposed surrogates, and we find many previously published proxies do correlate well with both the heat flux and stability boundary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated version that was accepted by Journal of Plasma Physics, with three new figures</p></details> |

Handling petabyte-scale image data requires high-performance computing and robust feature detection models. While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning approaches are widely used for remote sensing (RS),similar to the success in transformer based large language models, Vision Transformers (ViTs) offer advantages in capturing long-range dependencies and global context via attention mechanisms. ViTs support pretraining via self-supervised learning-addressing the common limitation of labeled data in Arctic feature detection and outperform CNNs on benchmark datasets. Arctic also poses challenges for model generalization, especially when features with the same semantic class exhibit diverse spectral characteristics. To address these issues for Arctic feature detection, we integrate geospatial location embeddings into ViTs to improve adaptation across regions. This work investigates: (1) the suitability of pre-trained ViTs as feature extractors for high-resolution Arctic remote sensing tasks, and (2) the benefit of combining image and location embeddings. Using previously published datasets for Arctic feature detection, we evaluate our models on three tasks-detecting ice-wedge polygons (IWP), retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS), and human-built infrastructure. We empirically explore multiple configurations to fuse image embeddings and location embeddings. Results show that ViTs with location embeddings outperform prior CNN-based models on two of the three tasks including F1 score increase from 0.84 to 0.92 for RTS detection, demonstrating the potential of transformer-based models with spatial awareness for Arctic RS applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 column IEEE format, 13 Figures</p></details> |

Under a coerciveness assumption, we show that an $\varepsilon$-minimizer can be computed in a time that is polynomial in the input size and in $|\log\varepsilon|$. This is obtained by establishing bit-size estimates on approximate minimizers and by applying the ellipsoid method. We also derive polynomial iteration complexity bounds for the interior-point method applied to the same class of problems. We deduce that the spectral radius of a partially symmetric, weakly irreducible nonnegative tensor can be approximated within an $\varepsilon$-error in polynomial time. For strongly irreducible tensors, we show in addition that the logarithm of the positive eigenvector is polynomial time approximable. Our results also yield that the the maximum of a nonnegative homogeneous $d$-form in the $\ell_d$ unit ball can be approximated in polynomial time. In particular, the spectral radius of uniform weighted hypergraphs and some known upper bounds for the clique number of uniform hypergraphs are polynomial time computable. In contrast, we provide an example showing that the Phase I approach needs exponentially many bits to solve the feasibility problem in geometric programming.</p></details> | 36 pages |
| **[Learning Pyramid-structured Long-range Dependencies for 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02853v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA) module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.

Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Random Registers for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02843v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) aims to transfer knowledge from a data-sufficient source domain to data-scarce target domains. Although Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown superior capability in many vision tasks, its transferability against huge domain gaps in CDFSL is still under-explored. In this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon: during the source-domain training, prompt tuning, as a common way to train ViT, could be harmful for the generalization of ViT in target domains, but setting them to random noises (i.e., random registers) could consistently improve target-domain performance. We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find that learnable prompts capture domain information during the training on the source dataset, which views irrelevant visual patterns as vital cues for recognition. This can be viewed as a kind of overfitting and increases the sharpness of the loss landscapes. In contrast, random registers are essentially a novel way of perturbing attention for the sharpness-aware minimization, which helps the model find a flattened minimum in loss landscapes, increasing the transferability. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a simple but effective approach for CDFSL to enhance the perturbation on attention maps by adding random registers on the semantic regions of image tokens, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of random registers. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and state-of-the-art performance.

Structured matrix representations are a promising way for reducing the number of parameters of these models. However, it seems unrealistic to expect that weight matrices of pretrained models can be accurately represented by structured matrices without any fine-tuning. To overcome this issue, we utilize the fact that LLM output is invariant under certain orthogonal transformations of weight matrices. This insight can be leveraged to identify transformations that significantly improve the compressibility of weights within structured classes. The proposed approach is applicable to various types of structured matrices that support efficient projection operations.

| **[Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10672v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, efficient evaluation metrics are vital for assessing their ability to compress information and reduce redundancy. While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable insights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to their \( O(n^3) \) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only serves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also provides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive discriminability and diversity. By employing the \( L_{1,2}\text{-norm} \) to further approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's information compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity to \( O(n^2) \) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the Matrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy for the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This performance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in tests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks and model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a reliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Existing works either allow rough language-based control, that is convenient but lacks fine-grained scene customization, or employ graph based control, which offers better controllability but demands considerable knowledge for the cumbersome graph design process. To address these challenges, we present FreeScene, a user-friendly framework that enables both convenient and effective control for indoor scene synthesis.Specifically, FreeScene supports free-form user inputs including text description and/or reference images, allowing users to express versatile design intentions. The user inputs are adequately analyzed and integrated into a graph representation by a VLM-based Graph Designer. We then propose MG-DiT, a Mixed Graph Diffusion Transformer, which performs graph-aware denoising to enhance scene generation. Our MG-DiT not only excels at preserving graph structure but also offers broad applicability to various tasks, including, but not limited to, text-to-scene, graph-to-scene, and rearrangement, all within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeScene provides an efficient and user-friendly solution that unifies text-based and graph based scene synthesis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of both generation quality and controllability in a range of applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Although current alignment methods rely primarily on explicit feedback, eye-tracking (ET) data offers insights into real-time cognitive processing during reading. In this paper, we present OASST-ETC, a novel eye-tracking corpus capturing reading patterns from 24 participants, while evaluating LLM-generated responses from the OASST1 dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct reading patterns between preferred and non-preferred responses, which we compare with synthetic eye-tracking data. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human reading measures and attention patterns from various transformer-based models, discovering stronger correlations in preferred responses. This work introduces a unique resource for studying human cognitive processing in LLM evaluation and suggests promising directions for incorporating eye-tracking data into alignment methods.

However, the "black box" nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where explainability is essential. While some techniques for generating explanations have been proposed, primarily for Convolutional Neural Networks, adapting such techniques to the new paradigm of Vision Transformers is non-trivial. This paper presents T-TAME, Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations, a general methodology for explaining deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. The proposed architecture and training technique can be easily applied to any convolutional or Vision Transformer-like neural network, using a streamlined training approach. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass; these explanation maps are comparable to or outperform the outputs of computationally expensive perturbation-based explainability techniques, achieving SOTA performance. We apply T-TAME to three popular deep learning classifier architectures, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art explainability methods. A detailed analysis of the results and an ablation study provide insights into how the T-TAME design choices affect the quality of the generated explanation maps.</p></details> | Accepted |

Good traffic consumer electronic systems require collaborative work between traffic algorithms and hardware. However, performance of popular traffic algorithms containing vehicle detection methods based on deep networks via learning data relation rather than learning differences in different lighting and occlusions is limited. In this paper, we present a dynamic Transformer network for vehicle detection (DTNet). DTNet utilizes a dynamic convolution to guide a deep network to dynamically generate weights to enhance adaptability of an obtained detector. Taking into relations of different information account, a mixed attention mechanism based channel attention and Transformer is exploited to strengthen relations of channels and pixels to extract more salient information for vehicle detection. To overcome the drawback of difference in an image account, a translation-variant convolution relies on spatial location information to refine obtained structural information for vehicle detection. Experimental results illustrate that our DTNet is competitive for vehicle detection.

This work investigates this question and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation, allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS) metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths. This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and 31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL)</p></details> |

Prior work on subfigure extraction has been limited in both dataset size and generalizability, leaving a critical open question: How does high-fidelity image-text alignment via large-scale subfigure extraction impact representation learning in vision-language models? We address this gap by introducing a scalable subfigure extraction pipeline based on transformer-based object detection, trained on a synthetic corpus of 500,000 compound figures, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both ImageCLEF 2016 and synthetic benchmarks. Using this pipeline, we release OPEN-PMC-18M, a large-scale high quality biomedical vision-language dataset comprising 18 million clinically relevant subfigure-caption pairs spanning radiology, microscopy, and visible light photography. We train and evaluate vision-language models on our curated datasets and show improved performance across retrieval, zero-shot classification, and robustness benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines. We release our dataset, models, and code to support reproducible benchmarks and further study into biomedical vision-language modeling and representation learning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Instead of assuming that extraterrestrial signals must be decoded, we evaluate whether inputs can trigger linguistic behavior in generative systems. This shifts the focus from decoding to viewing structured output as a sign of underlying regularity in the input. We tested GPT-2 small, a 117M-parameter model trained on English text, using four types of acoustic input: human speech, humpback whale vocalizations, Phylloscopus trochilus birdsong, and algorithmically generated white noise. All inputs were treated as noise-like, without any assumed symbolic encoding. To assess reactivity, we defined a composite score called Semantic Induction Potential (SIP), combining entropy, syntax coherence, compression gain, and repetition penalty. Results showed that whale and bird vocalizations had higher SIP scores than white noise, while human speech triggered only moderate responses. This suggests that language models may detect latent structure even in data without conventional semantics. We propose that this approach could complement traditional SETI methods, especially in cases where communicative intent is unknown. Generative reactivity may offer a different way to identify data worth closer attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the International Journal of Astrobiology</p></details> |

To ease the developer's task of writing smart contract, as other research efforts, we also use Business Process Model and Notation BPMN modeling to describe application requirements for trade of goods and services and then transform automatically the BPMN model into the methods of a smart contract. In our previous research we described our approach and a tool to Transform Automatically BPMN models into Smart contracts TABS. In this paper, we describe how the TABS approach is augmented with the support for a BPMN collaborative transaction by several actors. Our approach analyzes the BPMN model to determine which patterns in the BPMN model are suitable for use as collaborative transactions. The found BPMN patterns that are suitable as transactions are shown to the developer who decides which ones should be deployed as collaborative transactions. We describe how our approach automatically transform the BPMN model into smart contract the provides a transaction mechanism to enforce the transactional properties of the nested transactions. Our approach greatly reduces the developers task as synchronization of collaborative activities is provided by our approach, so that the developer needs to code only independent tasks with well-defined inputs and outputs. We also overview the TABS+ tool we built as a proof of concept to show that our approach is feasible. Finally, we provide estimates on the cost of supporting the nested BPMN collaborative transactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2505.24309</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches that rely on MLP-based hypernetworks with scalability limitations, our method employs a Transformer-based decoder to generate INR parameters from latent variables, addressing both representation capacity and computational efficiency. Our framework extends latent diffusion models (LDMs) to INR generation by replacing standard decoders with a Transformer-based hypernetwork, which can be trained either from scratch or via hyper-transforming: a strategy that fine-tunes only the decoder while freezing the pre-trained latent space. This enables efficient adaptation of existing generative models to INR-based representations without requiring full retraining. We validate our approach across multiple modalities, demonstrating improved scalability, expressiveness, and generalization over existing INR-based generative models. Our findings establish a unified and flexible framework for learning structured function representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[ToothForge: Automatic Dental Shape Generation using Synchronized Spectral Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02702v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ToothForge, a spectral approach for automatically generating novel 3D teeth, effectively addressing the sparsity of dental shape datasets. By operating in the spectral domain, our method enables compact machine learning modeling, allowing the generation of high-resolution tooth meshes in milliseconds. However, generating shape spectra comes with the instability of the decomposed harmonics. To address this, we propose modeling the latent manifold on synchronized frequential embeddings. Spectra of all data samples are aligned to a common basis prior to the training procedure, effectively eliminating biases introduced by the decomposition instability. Furthermore, synchronized modeling removes the limiting factor imposed by previous methods, which require all shapes to share a common fixed connectivity. Using a private dataset of real dental crowns, we observe a greater reconstruction quality of the synthetized shapes, exceeding those of models trained on unaligned embeddings. We also explore additional applications of spectral analysis in digital dentistry, such as shape compression and interpolation. ToothForge facilitates a range of approaches at the intersection of spectral analysis and machine learning, with fewer restrictions on mesh structure. This makes it applicable for shape analysis not only in dentistry, but also in broader medical applications, where guaranteeing consistent connectivity across shapes from various clinics is unrealistic.

We first formulate two problems of entity mentions -- ambiguity and variability -- and propose a framework analogous to clustering quality metrics. Specifically, we quantify through cluster analysis of LM internal representations the extent to which mentions of the same entity cluster together and mentions of different entities remain separated. Our experiments examine five Transformer-based autoregressive models, showing that they effectively identify and distinguish entities with metrics analogous to precision and recall ranging from 0.66 to 0.9. Further analysis reveals that entity-related information is compactly represented in a low-dimensional linear subspace at early LM layers. Additionally, we clarify how the characteristics of entity representations influence word prediction performance. These findings are interpreted through the lens of isomorphism between LM representations and entity-centric knowledge structures in the real world, providing insights into how LMs internally organize and use entity information.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Findings; 26 pages, 13 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Soft Sparse Shapes for Efficient Time-Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06892v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shapelets are discriminative subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time series classification. Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |

Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85\% and 7.54\% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a post-peer-review accepted manuscript from the proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI'25).

Our task was to classify rigidly-structured medical documents according to their content, and we found that using off-the-shelf semantic vector search produced slightly worse predictive accuracy than creating a bespoke lexical vector search model, and that it required significantly more time to execute.

In this work, we present OmniTalker, a unified framework that jointly generates synchronized talking audio-video content from input text while emulating the speaking and facial movement styles of the target identity, including speech characteristics, head motion, and facial dynamics. Our framework adopts a dual-branch diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, with one branch dedicated to audio generation and the other to video synthesis. At the shallow layers, cross-modal fusion modules are introduced to integrate information between the two modalities. In deeper layers, each modality is processed independently, with the generated audio decoded by a vocoder and the video rendered using a GAN-based high-quality visual renderer. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of DiT through a masked-infilling strategy, our model can simultaneously capture both audio and visual styles without requiring explicit style extraction modules. Thanks to the efficiency of the DiT backbone and the optimized visual renderer, OmniTalker achieves real-time inference at 25 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker is the first one-shot framework capable of jointly modeling speech and facial styles in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of generation quality, particularly in preserving style consistency and ensuring precise audio-video synchronization, all while maintaining efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> |

This study presents a customized Mixture of Expert (MoE) Transformer models for classifying small-scale French clinical texts at CHU Sainte-Justine Hospital. The MoE-Transformer addresses the dual challenges of effective training with limited data and low-resource computation suitable for in-house hospital use. Despite the success of biomedical pre-trained models such as CamemBERT-bio, DrBERT, and AliBERT, their high computational demands make them impractical for many clinical settings. Our MoE-Transformer model not only outperforms DistillBERT, CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and Transformer models on the same dataset but also achieves impressive results: an accuracy of 87\%, precision of 87\%, recall of 85\%, and F1-score of 86\%. While the MoE-Transformer does not surpass the performance of biomedical pre-trained BERT models, it can be trained at least 190 times faster, offering a viable alternative for settings with limited data and computational resources. Although the MoE-Transformer addresses challenges of generalization gaps and sharp minima, demonstrating some limitations for efficient and accurate clinical text classification, this model still represents a significant advancement in the field. It is particularly valuable for classifying small French clinical narratives within the privacy and constraints of hospital-based computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine</p></details> |
| **[Low-Resolution Self-Attention for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05026v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation tasks naturally require high-resolution information for pixel-wise segmentation and global context information for class prediction. While existing vision transformers demonstrate promising performance, they often utilize high-resolution context modeling, resulting in a computational bottleneck. In this work, we challenge conventional wisdom and introduce the Low-Resolution Self-Attention (LRSA) mechanism to capture global context at a significantly reduced computational cost, i.e., FLOPs. Our approach involves computing self-attention in a fixed low-resolution space regardless of the input image's resolution, with additional 3x3 depth-wise convolutions to capture fine details in the high-resolution space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our LRSA approach by building the LRFormer, a vision transformer with an encoder-decoder structure. Extensive experiments on the ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that LRFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models.

This paper presents HORUS: Holistic Operational Reality for Unified Systems, a Mixed Reality interface offering a comprehensive set of tools for managing multiple mobile robots simultaneously. HORUS enables operators to monitor individual robot statuses, visualize sensor data projected in real time, and assign tasks to single robots, subsets of the team, or the entire group, all from a Mini-Map (Ground Station). The interface also provides different teleoperation modes: a mini-map mode that allows teleoperation while observing the robot model and its transform on the mini-map, and a semi-immersive mode that offers a flat, screen-like view in either single or stereo view (3D). We conducted a user study in which participants used HORUS to manage a team of mobile robots tasked with finding clues in an environment, simulating search and rescue tasks. This study compared HORUS's full-team management capabilities with individual robot teleoperation. The experiments validated the versatility and effectiveness of HORUS in multi-robot coordination, demonstrating its potential to advance human-robot collaboration in dynamic, team-based environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, conference paper submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

This approach enables flexible and scalable training and allows the unit tester to learn directly from the coder's mistakes. Our derived ReasonFlux-Coder-7B and 14B models improve code generation accuracy by 5.3% and Best-of-N accuracy by 9.0% after optimization on Qwen2.5-Instruct models, outperforming similarly sized Qwen-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder, and Seed-Coder. They naturally extend to downstream tasks such as test-time scaling and agentic coding-achieving a 8.1% improvement over the base model. For the long-CoT model, our ReasonFlux-Coder-4B consistently outperforms Qwen3-4B while achieving 64.8% inference efficiency in unit test generation. Notably, we also find that our model can serve as an effective reward model for reinforcement learning on base models.

However, their large parameter size brings significant inference time computational challenges, including high encoding costs for large-scale corpora and increased query latency, limiting their practical deployment. While smaller retrievers offer better efficiency, they often fail to generalize effectively with limited supervised fine-tuning data. In this work, we introduce DRAMA, a training framework that leverages LLMs to train smaller generalizable dense retrievers. In particular, we adopt pruned LLMs as the backbone and train on diverse LLM-augmented data in a single-stage contrastive learning setup. Experiments show that DRAMA offers better multilingual and long-context capabilities than traditional encoder-based retrievers, and achieves strong performance across multiple tasks and languages. These highlight the potential of connecting the training of smaller retrievers with the growing advancements in LLMs, bridging the gap between efficiency and generalization.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[From Flat to Hierarchical: Extracting Sparse Representations with Matching Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03093v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the hypothesis that neural network representations encode abstract, interpretable features as linearly accessible, approximately orthogonal directions, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a popular tool in interpretability. However, recent work has demonstrated phenomenology of model representations that lies outside the scope of this hypothesis, showing signatures of hierarchical, nonlinear, and multi-dimensional features. This raises the question: do SAEs represent features that possess structure at odds with their motivating hypothesis? If not, does avoiding this mismatch help identify said features and gain further insights into neural network representations? To answer these questions, we take a construction-based approach and re-contextualize the popular matching pursuits (MP) algorithm from sparse coding to design MP-SAE -- an SAE that unrolls its encoder into a sequence of residual-guided steps, allowing it to capture hierarchical and nonlinearly accessible features. Comparing this architecture with existing SAEs on a mixture of synthetic and natural data settings, we show: (i) hierarchical concepts induce conditionally orthogonal features, which existing SAEs are unable to faithfully capture, and (ii) the nonlinear encoding step of MP-SAE recovers highly meaningful features, helping us unravel shared structure in the seemingly dichotomous representation spaces of different modalities in a vision-language model, hence demonstrating the assumption that useful features are solely linearly accessible is insufficient. We also show that the sequential encoder principle of MP-SAE affords an additional benefit of adaptive sparsity at inference time, which may be of independent interest. Overall, we argue our results provide credence to the idea that interpretability should begin with the phenomenology of representations, with methods emerging from assumptions that fit it.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Keyed Chaotic Dynamics for Privacy-Preserving Neural Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23655v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network inference typically operates on raw input data, increasing the risk of exposure during preprocessing and inference. Moreover, neural architectures lack efficient built-in mechanisms for directly authenticating input data. This work introduces a novel encryption method for ensuring the security of neural inference. By constructing key-conditioned chaotic graph dynamical systems, we enable the encryption and decryption of real-valued tensors within the neural architecture. The proposed dynamical systems are particularly suited to encryption due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and their capacity to produce complex, key-dependent nonlinear transformations from compact rules. This work establishes a paradigm for securing neural inference and opens new avenues for research on the application of graph dynamical systems in neural network security.</p></details> | 10 pages |

More recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 8 figures, 4 algorithms</p></details> |

Currently, all existing methods rely on 2D or textual modalities during training or together at inference. This highlights the clear absence of a model capable of processing 3D data alone for learning semantics end-to-end, along with the necessary data to train such a model. Meanwhile, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the de facto standard for 3D scene representation across various vision tasks. However, effectively integrating semantic reasoning into 3DGS in a generalizable manner remains an open challenge. To address these limitations, we introduce SceneSplat, to our knowledge the first large-scale 3D indoor scene understanding approach that operates natively on 3DGS. Furthermore, we propose a self-supervised learning scheme that unlocks rich 3D feature learning from unlabeled scenes. To power the proposed methods, we introduce SceneSplat-7K, the first large-scale 3DGS dataset for indoor scenes, comprising 7916 scenes derived from seven established datasets, such as ScanNet and Matterport3D. Generating SceneSplat-7K required computational resources equivalent to 150 GPU days on an L4 GPU, enabling standardized benchmarking for 3DGS-based reasoning for indoor scenes. Our exhaustive experiments on SceneSplat-7K demonstrate the significant benefit of the proposed method over the established baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code, model, and dataset will be released at https://unique1i.github.io/SceneSplat_webpage/</p></details> |

In this position paper, we advocate for charting the world's model population in a unified structure we call the Model Atlas: a graph that captures models, their attributes, and the weight transformations that connect them. The Model Atlas enables applications in model forensics, meta-ML research, and model discovery, challenging tasks given today's unstructured model repositories. However, because most models lack documentation, large atlas regions remain uncharted. Addressing this gap motivates new machine learning methods that treat models themselves as data, inferring properties such as functionality, performance, and lineage directly from their weights. We argue that a scalable path forward is to bypass the unique parameter symmetries that plague model weights. Charting all the world's models will require a community effort, and we hope its broad utility will rally researchers toward this goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://horwitz.ai/model-atlas</p></details> |
| **[Sample complexity of Schrödinger potential estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03043v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of Schr\"odinger potential estimation, which plays a crucial role in modern generative modelling approaches based on Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic optimal control for SDEs. Given a simple prior diffusion process, these methods search for a path between two given distributions $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ requiring minimal efforts. The optimal drift in this case can be expressed through a Schr\"odinger potential. In the present paper, we study generalization ability of an empirical Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk minimizer over a class of admissible log-potentials aimed at fitting the marginal distribution at time $T$. Under reasonable assumptions on the target distribution $\rho_T^*$ and the prior process, we derive a non-asymptotic high-probability upper bound on the KL-divergence between $\rho_T^*$ and the terminal density corresponding to the estimated log-potential. In particular, we show that the excess KL-risk may decrease as fast as $O(\log^2 n / n)$ when the sample size $n$ tends to infinity even if both $\rho_0$ and $\rho_T^*$ have unbounded supports.</p></details> | 60 pages |
| **[Kernel-based estimators for functional causal effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05024v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose causal effect estimators based on empirical Fr\'{e}chet means and operator-valued kernels, tailored to functional data spaces. These methods address the challenges of high-dimensionality, sequential ordering, and model complexity while preserving robustness to treatment misspecification. Using structural assumptions, we obtain compact representations of potential outcomes, enabling scalable estimation of causal effects over time and across covariates. We provide both theoretical, regarding the consistency of functional causal effects, as well as empirical comparison of a range of proposed causal effect estimators. Applications to binary treatment settings with functional outcomes illustrate the framework's utility in biomedical monitoring, where outcomes exhibit complex temporal dynamics. Our estimators accommodate scenarios with registered covariates and outcomes, aligning them to the Fr\'{e}chet means, as well as cases requiring higher-order representations to capture intricate covariate-outcome interactions. These advancements extend causal inference to dynamic and non-linear domains, offering new tools for understanding complex treatment effects in functional data settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/JordanRaykov/Kernel-based-estimators-for-Functional-Causal-Effects</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking Database Vulnerabilities: Zero-Knowledge Schema Inference Attacks in Text-to-SQL Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14545v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-SQL systems empower users to interact with databases using natural language, automatically translating queries into executable SQL code. However, their reliance on database schema information for SQL generation exposes them to significant security vulnerabilities, particularly schema inference attacks that can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation. In this paper, we introduce a novel zero-knowledge framework for reconstructing the underlying database schema of text-to-SQL models without any prior knowledge of the database. Our approach systematically probes text-to-SQL models with specially crafted questions and leverages a surrogate GPT-4 model to interpret the outputs, effectively uncovering hidden schema elements -- including tables, columns, and data types. We demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy in reconstructing table names, with F1 scores of up to .99 for generative models and .78 for fine-tuned models, underscoring the severity of schema leakage risks. We also show that our attack can steal prompt information in non-text-to-SQL models. Furthermore, we propose a simple protection mechanism for generative models and empirically show its limitations in mitigating these attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Yet, understanding how expertise emerges through joint training of gating mechanisms and experts remains incomplete, especially in scenarios without clear task partitions. Motivated by inference costs and data heterogeneity, we study how joint training of gating functions and experts can dynamically allocate domain-specific expertise across multiple underlying data distributions. As an outcome of our framework, we develop an instance tailored specifically to decentralized training scenarios, introducing \textit{Dynamically Decentralized Orchestration of MoEs} or \texttt{DDOME}. \texttt{DDOME} leverages heterogeneity emerging from distributional shifts across decentralized data sources to specialize experts dynamically. By integrating a pretrained common expert to inform a gating function, \texttt{DDOME} achieves personalized expert subset selection on-the-fly, facilitating just-in-time personalization. We empirically validate \texttt{DDOME} within a Federated Learning (FL) context: \texttt{DDOME} attains from 4\% up to an 24\% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art FL baselines in image and text classification tasks, while maintaining competitive zero-shot generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights confirming that the joint gating-experts training is critical for achieving meaningful expert specialization.</p></details> | 26 Pages |

These techniques are useful in a diverse array of tasks, including hypothesis testing and providing uncertainty quantification guarantees for machine learning systems. Much of the current interest in conformal prediction is due to its ability to integrate into complex machine learning workflows, solving the problem of forming prediction sets without any assumptions on the form of the data generating distribution. Since contemporary machine learning algorithms have generally proven difficult to analyze directly, conformal prediction's main appeal is its ability to provide formal, finite-sample guarantees when paired with such methods. The goal of this book is to teach the reader about the fundamental technical arguments that arise when researching conformal prediction and related questions in distribution-free inference. Many of these proof strategies, especially the more recent ones, are scattered among research papers, making it difficult for researchers to understand where to look, which results are important, and how exactly the proofs work. We hope to bridge this gap by curating what we believe to be some of the most important results in the literature and presenting their proofs in a unified language, with illustrations, and with an eye towards pedagogy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This material will be published by Cambridge University Press as Theoretical Foundations of Conformal Prediction by Anastasios N.

| **[Learning on Model Weights using Tree Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13569v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The number of publicly available models is rapidly increasing, yet most remain undocumented. Users looking for suitable models for their tasks must first determine what each model does. Training machine learning models to infer missing documentation directly from model weights is challenging, as these weights often contain significant variation unrelated to model functionality (denoted nuisance). Here, we identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. Concretely, while learning across Model Trees requires complex architectures, even a linear classifier trained on a single model layer often works within trees. While effective, these linear classifiers are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have many parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated and lightweight method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single hidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting the categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights. Excitingly, ProbeX can map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a weight-language embedding space, enabling model search via text, i.e., zero-shot model classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Steering vectors allow users to modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g. honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer, more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL System Demo 2025</p></details> |

However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages,5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

For smooth functions, Armijo-LS alleviates the need to know the global smoothness constant L and adapts to the ``local'' smoothness, enabling GD to converge faster. Existing theoretical analyses show that GD with Armijo-LS (GD-LS) can result in constant factor improvements over GD with a 1/L step-size (denoted as GD(1/L)). We strengthen these results and show that if the objective function satisfies a certain non-uniform smoothness condition, GD-LS can result in a faster convergence rate than GD(1/L). In particular, we prove that for convex objectives corresponding to logistic regression and multi-class classification, GD-LS can converge to the optimum at a linear rate, and hence improves over the sublinear convergence of GD(1/L). Furthermore, for non-convex objectives satisfying gradient domination (e.g., those corresponding to the softmax policy gradient in RL or generalized linear models with a logistic link function), GD-LS can match the fast convergence of algorithms tailored for these specific settings. Finally, we prove that under the interpolation assumption, for convex losses, stochastic GD with a stochastic line-search can match the fast convergence of GD-LS</p></details> | ICML 2025. 37 pages |

By measuring the current functionality or operability of individual components an isolated glimpse into the system is given. Literature provides several of these detached assessments, often in the form of safety or performance measures. But dependencies, redundancies, error propagation and conflicting functionality statements do not allow for easy combination of these measures into a big picture of the functioning of the entire AD stack. Data is processed and exchanged between different components, each of which can fail, making an overall statement challenging. The lack of functionality assessment frameworks that tackle these problems underlines this complexity. This article presents a novel framework for inferring an overall functionality statement for complex component based systems by considering their dependencies, redundancies, error propagation paths and the assessments of individual components. Our framework first incorporates a comprehensive conversion to an assessment representation of the system. The representation is based on Subjective Networks (SNs) that allow for easy identification of faulty system parts. Second, the framework offers a flexible method for computing the system's functionality while dealing with contradicting assessments about the same component and dependencies, as well as redundancies, of the system. We discuss the framework's capabilities on real-life data of our AD stack with assessments of various components.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, these models are impractical for processing streaming data in real-time. In this work, we adapt a sliding window diffusion framework to the speech enhancement task. Our approach progressively corrupts speech signals through time, assigning more noise to frames close to the present in a buffer. This approach outputs denoised frames with a delay proportional to the chosen buffer size, enabling a trade-off between performance and latency. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms standard diffusion models and runs efficiently on a GPU, achieving an input-output latency in the order of 0.3 to 1 seconds. This marks the first practical diffusion-based solution for online speech enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Our work generalizes and simplifies prior work of Hastings, by building on his quantum algorithm for the Tensor Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem. We achieve our quantum speedup using a general framework based on the Kikuchi Method (recovering the quartic speedup for Tensor PCA), and we anticipate it will yield similar speedups for further planted inference problems. These speedups rely on the fact that planted inference problems naturally instantiate the Guided Sparse Hamiltonian problem. Since the Planted Noisy $k$XOR problem has been used as a component of certain cryptographic constructions, our work suggests that some of these are susceptible to super-quadratic quantum attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short version appeared in SODA 2025 and QIP 2025.

Nonetheless, processing long videos remains challenging due to high computational demands and the redundancy present in the visual data. In this work, we propose METok, a training-free, Multi-stage Event-based Token compression framework designed to accelerate VLLMs' inference while preserving accuracy. METok progressively eliminates redundant visual tokens across three critical stages: (1) event-aware compression during vision encoding, (2) hierarchical token pruning in the prefilling stage based on semantic alignment and event importance, and (3) a decoding-stage KV Cache optimization that further reduces memory consumption. Our experiments on diverse video benchmarks demonstrate that METok achieves an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy by dynamically selecting informative visual tokens. For instance, equipping LongVA-7B with METok realizes an 80.6% FLOPs reduction and 93.5% KV Cache memory savings, all while maintaining comparable or even superior accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, the limited storage, weight, and power of edge devices make it difficult to deploy LLM-powered applications. These devices must balance latency requirements with energy consumption and model accuracy. In this paper, we first quantify the challenges of deploying LLMs on off-the-shelf edge devices and then we present CLONE, an in-depth algorithm-hardware co-design at both the model- and system-level that intelligently integrates real-time, energy optimization while maintaining robust generality. In order to maximize the synergistic benefits of these algorithms in always-on and intermediate edge computing settings, we specialize in a 28nm scalable hardware accelerator system. We implement and extensively evaluate CLONE on two off-the-shelf edge platforms. Experiments show that CLONE effectively accelerates the inference process up to 11.92x, and saves energy up to 7.36x, while maintaining high-generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX ATC 2025</p></details> |

We introduce SOCIAL GENOME, the first benchmark for fine-grained, grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models. SOCIAL GENOME contains 272 videos of interactions and 1,486 human-annotated reasoning traces related to inferences about these interactions. These traces contain 5,777 reasoning steps that reference evidence from visual cues, verbal cues, vocal cues, and external knowledge (contextual knowledge external to videos). SOCIAL GENOME is also the first modeling challenge to study external knowledge in social reasoning. SOCIAL GENOME computes metrics to holistically evaluate semantic and structural qualities of model-generated social reasoning traces. We demonstrate the utility of SOCIAL GENOME through experiments with state-of-the-art models, identifying performance gaps and opportunities for future research to improve the grounded social reasoning abilities of multimodal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review, 24 pages</p></details> |
| **[Asymptotically perfect seeded graph matching without edge correlation (and applications to inference)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02825v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the OmniMatch algorithm for seeded multiple graph matching. In the setting of $d$-dimensional Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG), we prove that under mild assumptions, OmniMatch with $s$ seeds asymptotically and efficiently perfectly aligns $O(s^{\alpha})$ unseeded vertices -- for $\alpha<2\wedge d/4$ -- across multiple networks even in the presence of no edge correlation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across numerous simulations and in the context of shuffled graph hypothesis testing. In the shuffled testing setting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices across graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for misaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power. We further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from connectomics and machine translation.</p></details> | 10 figures, 35 pages |
| **[P-TAME: Explain Any Image Classifier with Trained Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17813v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in critical fields where predictions need to be accompanied by justifications is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In this paper, we introduce P-TAME (Perturbation-based Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations), a model-agnostic method for explaining DNN-based image classifiers. P-TAME employs an auxiliary image classifier to extract features from the input image, bypassing the need to tailor the explanation method to the internal architecture of the backbone classifier being explained. Unlike traditional perturbation-based methods, which have high computational requirements, P-TAME offers an efficient alternative by generating high-resolution explanations in a single forward pass during inference. We apply P-TAME to explain the decisions of VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, three distinct and widely used image classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method matches or outperforms previous explainability methods, including model-specific approaches. Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (Volume 6)</p></details> |
| **[The Bayesian Finite Element Method in Inverse Problems: a Critical Comparison between Probabilistic Models for Discretization Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02815v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using the finite element method (FEM) in inverse problems, its discretization error can produce parameter estimates that are inaccurate and overconfident. The Bayesian finite element method (BFEM) provides a probabilistic model for the epistemic uncertainty due to discretization error. In this work, we apply BFEM to various inverse problems, and compare its performance to the random mesh finite element method (RM-FEM) and the statistical finite element method (statFEM), which serve as a frequentist and inference-based counterpart to BFEM. We find that by propagating this uncertainty to the posterior, BFEM can produce more accurate parameter estimates and prevent overconfidence, compared to FEM. Because the BFEM covariance operator is designed to leave uncertainty only in the appropriate space, orthogonal to the FEM basis, BFEM is able to outperform RM-FEM, which does not have such a structure to its covariance. Although inferring the discretization error via a model misspecification component is possible as well, as is done in statFEM, the feasibility of such an approach is contingent on the availability of sufficient data. We find that the BFEM is the most robust way to consistently propagate uncertainty due to discretization error to the posterior of a Bayesian inverse problem.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[AI-Driven Vehicle Condition Monitoring with Cell-Aware Edge Service Migration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02785v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to the condition monitoring of vehicular equipment, aiming to enhance maintenance strategies, reduce costs, and improve safety. Leveraging the edge computing paradigm, AI-based condition monitoring systems process vast streams of vehicular data to detect anomalies and optimize operational performance. In this work, we introduce a novel vehicle condition monitoring service that enables real-time diagnostics of a diverse set of anomalies while remaining practical for deployment in real-world edge environments. To address mobility challenges, we propose a closed-loop service orchestration framework where service migration across edge nodes is dynamically triggered by network-related metrics. Our approach has been implemented and tested in a real-world race circuit environment equipped with 5G network capabilities under diverse operational conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ensuring low-latency AI inference and adaptive service placement, highlighting its potential for intelligent transportation and mobility applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 8 figures |
| **[LeYOLO, New Embedded Architecture for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14239v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient computation in deep neural networks is crucial for real-time object detection. However, recent advancements primarily result from improved high-performing hardware rather than improving parameters and FLOP efficiency. This is especially evident in the latest YOLO architectures, where speed is prioritized over lightweight design. As a result, object detection models optimized for low-resource environments like microcontrollers have received less attention. For devices with limited computing power, existing solutions primarily rely on SSDLite or combinations of low-parameter classifiers, creating a noticeable gap between YOLO-like architectures and truly efficient lightweight detectors. This raises a key question: Can a model optimized for parameter and FLOP efficiency achieve accuracy levels comparable to mainstream YOLO models? To address this, we introduce two key contributions to object detection models using MSCOCO as a base validation set. First, we propose LeNeck, a general-purpose detection framework that maintains inference speed comparable to SSDLite while significantly improving accuracy and reducing parameter count. Second, we present LeYOLO, an efficient object detection model designed to enhance computational efficiency in YOLO-based architectures. LeYOLO effectively bridges the gap between SSDLite-based detectors and YOLO models, offering high accuracy in a model as compact as MobileNets. Both contributions are particularly well-suited for mobile, embedded, and ultra-low-power devices, including microcontrollers, where computational efficiency is critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://crv.pubpub.org/pub/sae4lpdf</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Learning Binarized Representations with Pseudo-positive Sample Enhancement for Efficient Graph Collaborative Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02750v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning vectorized embeddings is fundamental to many recommender systems for user-item matching. To enable efficient online inference, representation binarization, which embeds latent features into compact binary sequences, has recently shown significant promise in optimizing both memory usage and computational overhead. However, existing approaches primarily focus on numerical quantization, neglecting the associated information loss, which often results in noticeable performance degradation. To address these issues, we study the problem of graph representation binarization for efficient collaborative filtering. Our findings indicate that explicitly mitigating information loss at various stages of embedding binarization has a significant positive impact on performance. Building on these insights, we propose an enhanced framework, BiGeaR++, which specifically leverages supervisory signals from pseudo-positive samples, incorporating both real item data and latent embedding samples. Compared to its predecessor BiGeaR, BiGeaR++ introduces a fine-grained inference distillation mechanism and an effective embedding sample synthesis approach. Empirical evaluations across five real-world datasets demonstrate that the new designs in BiGeaR++ work seamlessly well with other modules, delivering substantial improvements of around 1%-10% over BiGeaR and thus achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to the competing methods. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/QueYork/BiGeaR-SS.</p></details> | Accepted by TOIS |
| **[No Training, No Problem: Rethinking Classifier-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02687v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become the standard method for enhancing the quality of conditional diffusion models. However, employing CFG requires either training an unconditional model alongside the main diffusion model or modifying the training procedure by periodically inserting a null condition. There is also no clear extension of CFG to unconditional models. In this paper, we revisit the core principles of CFG and introduce a new method, independent condition guidance (ICG), which provides the benefits of CFG without the need for any special training procedures. Our approach streamlines the training process of conditional diffusion models and can also be applied during inference on any pre-trained conditional model. Additionally, by leveraging the time-step information encoded in all diffusion networks, we propose an extension of CFG, called time-step guidance (TSG), which can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. Our guidance techniques are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as CFG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ICG matches the performance of standard CFG across various conditional diffusion models. Moreover, we show that TSG improves generation quality in a manner similar to CFG, without relying on any conditional information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Relational Learning for Few-Shot Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01205v4)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations, and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/alexhw15/HiRe.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2023</p></details> |

Building on this progress, we investigate their potential in the realm of local life services. In this study, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and systematically evaluate the performance of diverse LLMs across a wide range of tasks relevant to local life services. To further enhance their effectiveness, we explore two key approaches: model fine-tuning and agent-based workflows. Our findings reveal that even a relatively compact 7B model can attain performance levels comparable to a much larger 72B model, effectively balancing inference cost and model capability. This optimization greatly enhances the feasibility and efficiency of deploying LLMs in real-world online services, making them more practical and accessible for local life applications.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

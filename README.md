| **[Sonata: Self-Supervised Learning of Reliable Point Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16429v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we question whether we have a reliable self-supervised point cloud model that can be used for diverse 3D tasks via simple linear probing, even with limited data and minimal computation. We find that existing 3D self-supervised learning approaches fall short when evaluated on representation quality through linear probing. We hypothesize that this is due to what we term the "geometric shortcut", which causes representations to collapse to low-level spatial features. This challenge is unique to 3D and arises from the sparse nature of point cloud data. We address it through two key strategies: obscuring spatial information and enhancing the reliance on input features, ultimately composing a Sonata of 140k point clouds through self-distillation. Sonata is simple and intuitive, yet its learned representations are strong and reliable: zero-shot visualizations demonstrate semantic grouping, alongside strong spatial reasoning through nearest-neighbor relationships. Sonata demonstrates exceptional parameter and data efficiency, tripling linear probing accuracy (from 21.8% to 72.5%) on ScanNet and nearly doubling performance with only 1% of the data compared to previous approaches. Full fine-tuning further advances SOTA across both 3D indoor and outdoor perception tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, produced by Pointcept x Meta, project page: https://xywu.me/sonata/</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Continuous and Discrete Tokens for Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16430v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive visual generation models typically rely on tokenizers to compress images into tokens that can be predicted sequentially. A fundamental dilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward modeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and tokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual details, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation pipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by maintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while preserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we decouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through post-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from continuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise quantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension, paired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently model the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous methods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates that bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the strengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

| **[XAttention: Block Sparse Attention with Antidiagonal Scoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16428v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) are vital for real-world applications but suffer high computational costs due to attention's quadratic complexity. Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

| **[Multi-subject Open-set Personalization in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06187v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video personalization methods allow us to synthesize videos with specific concepts such as people, pets, and places. However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist $-$ a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[GAEA: A Geolocation Aware Conversational Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16423v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image geolocalization, in which, traditionally, an AI model predicts the precise GPS coordinates of an image is a challenging task with many downstream applications. However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their knowledge other than the GPS coordinate; the model lacks an understanding of the location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In recent days, with tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs) proprietary and open-source researchers have attempted to geolocalize images via LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for more specialized downstream tasks, one of which is geolocalization, LMMs struggle. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by introducing a conversational model GAEA that can provide information regarding the location of an image, as required by a user. No large-scale dataset enabling the training of such a model exists. Thus we propose a comprehensive dataset GAEA with 800K images and around 1.6M question answer pairs constructed by leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For quantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark comprising 4K image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse question types. We consider 11 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LMMs and demonstrate that GAEA significantly outperforms the best open-source model, LLaVA-OneVision by 25.69% and the best proprietary model, GPT-4o by 8.28%.

| **[SynCity: Training-Free Generation of 3D Worlds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16420v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of generating 3D worlds from textual descriptions. We propose SynCity, a training- and optimization-free approach, which leverages the geometric precision of pre-trained 3D generative models and the artistic versatility of 2D image generators to create large, high-quality 3D spaces. While most 3D generative models are object-centric and cannot generate large-scale worlds, we show how 3D and 2D generators can be combined to generate ever-expanding scenes. Through a tile-based approach, we allow fine-grained control over the layout and the appearance of scenes. The world is generated tile-by-tile, and each new tile is generated within its world-context and then fused with the scene. SynCity generates compelling and immersive scenes that are rich in detail and diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://research.paulengstler.com/syncity/</p></details> |
| **[Stop Overthinking: A Survey on Efficient Reasoning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16419v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks. Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/Eclipsess/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-LLMs</p></details> |
| **[InfiniteYou: Flexible Photo Recrafting While Preserving Your Identity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16418v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving flexible and high-fidelity identity-preserved image generation remains formidable, particularly with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) like FLUX. We introduce InfiniteYou (InfU), one of the earliest robust frameworks leveraging DiTs for this task. InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bytedance.github.io/InfiniteYou/ Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/InfiniteYou</p></details> |
| **[Computing Lindahl Equilibrium for Public Goods with and without Funding Caps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16414v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lindahl equilibrium is a solution concept for allocating a fixed budget across several divisible public goods. It always lies in the core, meaning that the equilibrium allocation satisfies desirable stability and proportional fairness properties. We consider a model where agents have separable linear utility functions over the public goods, and the output assigns to each good an amount of spending, summing to at most the available budget. In the uncapped setting, each of the public goods can absorb any amount of funding. In this case, it is known that Lindahl equilibrium is equivalent to maximizing Nash social welfare, and this allocation can be computed by a public-goods variant of the proportional response dynamics. We introduce a new convex programming formulation for computing this solution and show that it is related to Nash welfare maximization through duality and reformulation. We then show that the proportional response dynamics is equivalent to running mirror descent on our new formulation, thereby providing a new and immediate proof of the convergence guarantee for the dynamics. Our new formulation has similarities to Shmyrev's convex program for Fisher market equilibrium. In the capped setting, each public good has an upper bound on the amount of funding it can receive. In this setting, existence of Lindahl equilibrium was only known via fixed-point arguments. The existence of an efficient algorithm computing one has been a long-standing open question. We prove that our new convex program continues to work when the cap constraints are added, and its optimal solutions are Lindahl equilibria. Thus, we establish that Lindahl equilibrium can be efficiently computed in the capped setting. Our result also implies that approximately core-stable allocations can be efficiently computed for the class of separable piecewise-linear concave (SPLC) utilities.</p></details> | 32 pages |

However, the underlying multi-view rendering, along with supervision from large-scale generative models, is computationally expensive and under-constrained. We propose DreamTexture, a novel Shape-from-Virtual-Texture approach that leverages monocular depth cues to reconstruct 3D objects. Our method textures an input image by aligning a virtual texture with the real depth cues in the input, exploiting the inherent understanding of monocular geometry encoded in modern diffusion models. We then reconstruct depth from the virtual texture deformation with a new conformal map optimization, which alleviates memory-intensive volumetric representations. Our experiments reveal that generative models possess an understanding of monocular shape cues, which can be extracted by augmenting and aligning texture cues -- a novel monocular reconstruction paradigm that we call Analysis by Augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://anantarb.github.io/dreamtexture/</p></details> |
| **[M3: 3D-Spatial MultiModal Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16413v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present 3D Spatial MultiModal Memory (M3), a multimodal memory system designed to retain information about medium-sized static scenes through video sources for visual perception. By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 homepage: https://m3-spatial-memory.github.io code: https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial</p></details> |
| **[VerbDiff: Text-Only Diffusion Models with Enhanced Interaction Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16406v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large-scale text-to-image diffusion models generate photorealistic images but often struggle to accurately depict interactions between humans and objects due to their limited ability to differentiate various interaction words. In this work, we propose VerbDiff to address the challenge of capturing nuanced interactions within text-to-image diffusion models. VerbDiff is a novel text-to-image generation model that weakens the bias between interaction words and objects, enhancing the understanding of interactions. Specifically, we disentangle various interaction words from frequency-based anchor words and leverage localized interaction regions from generated images to help the model better capture semantics in distinctive words without extra conditions. Our approach enables the model to accurately understand the intended interaction between humans and objects, producing high-quality images with accurate interactions aligned with specified verbs. Extensive experiments on the HICO-DET dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025, code : https://github.com/SeungJuCha/VerbDiff.git</p></details> |
| **[The Emperor's New Clothes in Benchmarking? A Rigorous Examination of Mitigation Strategies for LLM Benchmark Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16402v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples in the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and undermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed various mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including modifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a rigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies remains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline along with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a fine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation strategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy matching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or misleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing question-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs, 5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios reveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the vanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none effectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings underscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation strategies. Our code repository is available at https://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/BDC_mitigation_assessment.</p></details> | 23 pages |

We propose SA-Occ, the first Satellite-Assisted 3D occupancy prediction model, which leverages GPS & IMU to integrate historical yet readily available satellite imagery into real-time applications, effectively mitigating limitations of ego-vehicle perceptions, involving occlusions and degraded performance in distant regions. To address the core challenges of cross-view perception, we propose: 1) Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion, which resolves inconsistencies in dynamic regions caused by the temporal asynchrony between satellite and street views; 2) 3D-Proj Guidance, a module that enhances 3D feature extraction from inherently 2D satellite imagery; and 3) Uniform Sampling Alignment, which aligns the sampling density between street and satellite views. Evaluated on Occ3D-nuScenes, SA-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially among single-frame methods, with a 39.05% mIoU (a 6.97% improvement), while incurring only 6.93 ms of additional latency per frame. Our code and newly curated dataset are available at https://github.com/chenchen235/SA-Occ.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Graph of Effort: Quantifying Risk of AI Usage for Vulnerability Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16392v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With AI-based software becoming widely available, the risk of exploiting its capabilities, such as high automation and complex pattern recognition, could significantly increase. An AI used offensively to attack non-AI assets is referred to as offensive AI. Current research explores how offensive AI can be utilized and how its usage can be classified. Additionally, methods for threat modeling are being developed for AI-based assets within organizations. However, there are gaps that need to be addressed. Firstly, there is a need to quantify the factors contributing to the AI threat. Secondly, there is a requirement to create threat models that analyze the risk of being attacked by AI for vulnerability assessment across all assets of an organization. This is particularly crucial and challenging in cloud environments, where sophisticated infrastructure and access control landscapes are prevalent. The ability to quantify and further analyze the threat posed by offensive AI enables analysts to rank vulnerabilities and prioritize the implementation of proactive countermeasures. To address these gaps, this paper introduces the Graph of Effort, an intuitive, flexible, and effective threat modeling method for analyzing the effort required to use offensive AI for vulnerability exploitation by an adversary. While the threat model is functional and provides valuable support, its design choices need further empirical validation in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; accepted for the 16th International Conference on Cloud Computing, GRIDs, and Virtualization (Cloud Computing 2025), Valencia, Spain, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Where's That Voice Coming? Continual Learning for Sound Source Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03661v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound source localization (SSL) is essential for many speech-processing applications. Deep learning models have achieved high performance, but often fail when the training and inference environments differ. Adapting SSL models to dynamic acoustic conditions faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose an exemplar-free continual learning strategy for SSL (CL-SSL) to address such a forgetting phenomenon. CL-SSL applies task-specific sub-networks to adapt across diverse acoustic environments while retaining previously learned knowledge. It also uses a scaling mechanism to limit parameter growth, ensuring consistent performance across incremental tasks. We evaluated CL-SSL on simulated data with varying microphone distances and real-world data with different noise levels. The results demonstrate CL-SSL's ability to maintain high accuracy with minimal parameter increase, offering an efficient solution for SSL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |

| **[The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate is an evolving complex system with dynamic interactions and non-linear feedback mechanisms, shaping environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Crop production is highly sensitive to such climatic fluctuations. This paper studies the price volatility of agricultural crops as influenced by meteorological variables (and many other environmental, social and governance factors), which is a critical challenge in sustainable finance, agricultural planning, and policy-making. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states of Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns of crop prices from 2012 to 2024. This study further explores the cross-correlations between volatility and the meteorological variables. Further, a Granger-causality test is carried out to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the price volatility. Finally, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. We believe that this will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, incorporating meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v5)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, VLDB 2025</p></details> |
| **[Masked Mixers for Language Generation and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01482v4)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most input information is lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers and more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers, which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. The masked mixer learns causal language modeling more efficiently than early transformer implementations and even outperforms optimized, current transformers when training on small ($n_{ctx}<512$) but not larger context windows. Evidence is presented for the hypothesis that differences in transformer and masked mixer training efficiencies for various tasks are best predicted by input representation accuracy, or equivalently global invertibility. We hypothesize that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be more detrimental to retrieval than generation, as the former is more closely approximated by a bijective and thus invertible function. We find that masked mixers are more effective retrieval models both when the pretrained embedding model is unchanged as well as when the embedding model is modified via cosine similarity-based InfoNCE loss minimization. A small masked mixer is shown to outperform a large and near state-of-the-art transformer-based retrieval model, despite the latter being trained with many orders of magnitude more data and compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, 14 supplementary figures, 10 supplementary tables</p></details> |
| **[JARVIS-VLA: Post-Training Large-Scale Vision Language Models to Play Visual Games with Keyboards and Mouse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16365v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, action-based decision-making in open-world environments has gained significant attention. Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

However, this paradigm disrupts the subsequent tokens prediction, degrading model performance and linguistic coherence. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics overemphasize contextual forgetting while inadequately assessing response fluency and relevance. To address these challenges, we propose ReLearn, a data augmentation and fine-tuning pipeline for effective unlearning, along with a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework introduces Knowledge Forgetting Rate (KFR) and Knowledge Retention Rate (KRR) to measure knowledge-level preservation, and Linguistic Score (LS) to evaluate generation quality. Our experiments show that ReLearn successfully achieves targeted forgetting while preserving high-quality output.

On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to provide a near-term route to quantum utility or advantage, and is usually constructed by using parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in combination with a classical optimizer for training. Although VQAs have been proposed for a multitude of tasks such as ground-state estimation, combinatorial optimization and unitary compilation, there remain major challenges in its trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra Supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training schemes that combine an existing g-sim method (that uses the underlying group structure of the operators) and the Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically test our proposal for ground-state estimation using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and classification of quantum phases using quantum neural networks. Our methods show better accuracy and success of trials, and also need fewer calls to the quantum hardware on an average than using only PSR (upto 60% reduction), that runs exclusively on quantum hardware. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, 4 algorithms</p></details> |

While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</p></details> | Work in progress |

The computational resources and large datasets required, however, limit their applicability in biological contexts. We introduce Lyra, a subquadratic architecture for sequence modeling, grounded in the biological framework of epistasis for understanding sequence-to-function relationships. Mathematically, we demonstrate that state space models efficiently capture global epistatic interactions and combine them with projected gated convolutions for modeling local relationships. We demonstrate that Lyra is performant across over 100 wide-ranging biological tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many key areas, including protein fitness landscape prediction, biophysical property prediction (e.g. disordered protein region functions) peptide engineering applications (e.g. antibody binding, cell-penetrating peptide prediction), RNA structure analysis, RNA function prediction, and CRISPR guide design. It achieves this with orders-of-magnitude improvements in inference speed and reduction in parameters (up to 120,000-fold in our tests) compared to recent biology foundation models. Using Lyra, we were able to train and run every task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing access to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential applications to many fields.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |

While conventional methods require per-scene optimization, more recently several feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate pixel-aligned Gaussian representations with a learnable network, which are generalizable to different scenes. However, these methods simply combine pixel-aligned Gaussians from multiple views as scene representations, thereby leading to artifacts and extra memory cost without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different images. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Graph Network (GGN) to generate efficient and generalizable Gaussian representations. Specifically, we construct Gaussian Graphs to model the relations of Gaussian groups from different views. To support message passing at Gaussian level, we reformulate the basic graph operations over Gaussian representations, enabling each Gaussian to benefit from its connected Gaussian groups with Gaussian feature fusion. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian pooling layer to aggregate various Gaussian groups for efficient representations. We conduct experiments on the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our model uses fewer Gaussians and achieves better image quality with higher rendering speed.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

The existing research on event coreference resolution is mostly limited to news articles. In this paper, we present the first dataset for the legal domain, LegalCore, which has been annotated with comprehensive event and event coreference information. The legal contract documents we annotated in this dataset are several times longer than news articles, with an average length of around 25k tokens per document. The annotations show that legal documents have dense event mentions and feature both short-distance and super long-distance coreference links between event mentions. We further benchmark mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset for both event detection and event coreference resolution tasks, and find that this dataset poses significant challenges for state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, which perform significantly worse than a supervised baseline.

In this paper, we explore the potential of multimodal LLMs (MLLM) for geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), a field that leverages spatial data to address challenges in domains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban Geography, Urban Perception, and Remote Sensing. We propose a MLLM (OmniGeo) tailored to geospatial applications, capable of processing and analyzing heterogeneous data sources, including satellite imagery, geospatial metadata, and textual descriptions. By combining the strengths of natural language understanding and spatial reasoning, our model enhances the ability of instruction following and the accuracy of GeoAI systems.

Speedups ranging from 8x to 1,000x over XFoil are demonstrated, after controlling for equivalent accuracy. NeuralFoil computes both global and local quantities (lift, drag, velocity distribution, etc.) over a broad input space, including: an 18-dimensional space of airfoil shapes, possibly including control deflections; a 360 degree range of angles of attack; Reynolds numbers from $10^2$ to $10^{10}$; subsonic flows up to the transonic drag rise; and with varying turbulence parameters. Results match those of XFoil closely: the mean relative error of drag is 0.37% on simple cases, and remains as low as 2.0% on a test dataset with numerous post-stall and transitional cases. NeuralFoil facilitates gradient-based design optimization, due to its $C^\infty$-continuous solutions, automatic-differentiation-compatibility, and bounded computational cost without non-convergence issues. NeuralFoil is a hybrid of physics-informed machine learning techniques and analytical models. Here, physics information includes symmetries that are structurally embedded into the model architecture, feature engineering using domain knowledge, and guaranteed extrapolation to known limit cases. This work also introduces a new approach for surrogate model uncertainty quantification that enables robust design optimization. This work discusses the methodology and performance of NeuralFoil with several case studies, including a practical airfoil design optimization study including both aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic constraints. Here, NeuralFoil optimization is able to produce airfoils nearly identical in performance and shape to expert-designed airfoils within seconds; these computationally-optimized airfoils provide a useful starting point for further expert refinement.</p></details> | 42 pages, 14 figures |

However, training models for high-resolution image generation remains challenging, particularly when training data and computational resources are limited. In this paper, we explore this practical problem from two key perspectives: data and parameter efficiency, and propose a set of key guidelines for ultra-resolution adaptation termed \emph{URAE}. For data efficiency, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that synthetic data generated by some teacher models can significantly promote training convergence. For parameter efficiency, we find that tuning minor components of the weight matrices outperforms widely-used low-rank adapters when synthetic data are unavailable, offering substantial performance gains while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as FLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, \textit{i.e.}, setting the guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory performance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable 2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1 [Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation.

Fan et al. (2012) introduced a curve-free Bayesian decision-theoretic design (CFBD), which leverages the assumption of a monotonic dose-toxicity relationship without directly modeling dose-toxicity curves. This approach has also been extended to drug combinations for determining the MTD (Lee et al., 2017). Although CFBD has demonstrated improved trial efficiency by using fewer patients while maintaining high accuracy in identifying the MTD, it may artificially inflate the effective sample sizes for the updated prior distributions, particularly at the lowest and highest dose levels. This can lead to either overshooting or undershooting the target dose. In this paper, we propose a modification to CFBD's prior distribution updates that balances effective sample sizes across different doses. Simulation results show that with the modified prior specification, CFBD achieves a more focused dose allocation at the MTD and offers more precise dose recommendations with fewer patients on average. It also demonstrates robustness to other well-known dose finding designs in literature.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Multi-Output Distributional Fairness via Post-Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00553v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The post-processing approaches are becoming prominent techniques to enhance machine learning models' fairness because of their intuitiveness, low computational cost, and excellent scalability. However, most existing post-processing methods are designed for task-specific fairness measures and are limited to single-output models. In this paper, we introduce a post-processing method for multi-output models, such as the ones used for multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning, to enhance a model's distributional parity, a task-agnostic fairness measure. Existing methods for achieving distributional parity rely on the (inverse) cumulative density function of a model's output, restricting their applicability to single-output models. Extending previous works, we propose to employ optimal transport mappings to move a model's outputs across different groups towards their empirical Wasserstein barycenter. An approximation technique is applied to reduce the complexity of computing the exact barycenter and a kernel regression method is proposed to extend this process to out-of-sample data. Our empirical studies evaluate the proposed approach against various baselines on multi-task/multi-class classification and representation learning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

This formulation is elegant and powerful, but unable to tackle dynamic scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Dynamic Point Maps (DPM), extending standard point maps to support 4D tasks such as motion segmentation, scene flow estimation, 3D object tracking, and 2D correspondence. Our key intuition is that, when time is introduced, there are several possible spatial and time references that can be used to define the point maps. We identify a minimal subset of such combinations that can be regressed by a network to solve the sub tasks mentioned above. We train a DPM predictor on a mixture of synthetic and real data and evaluate it across diverse benchmarks for video depth prediction, dynamic point cloud reconstruction, 3D scene flow and object pose tracking, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Active Learning (AL) has shown promise for parameter inference with limited data and budget constraints in machine learning/deep learning tasks. However, AL for reliability model parameter inference remains underexplored for repairable hardware systems. It requires specialized AL Acquisition Functions (AFs) that consider hardware aging and the fact that a hardware system consists of multiple sub-systems, which may undergo only partial testing during a given diagnostic test. To address these challenges, we propose a relaxed Mixed Integer Semidefinite Program (MISDP) AL AF that incorporates Diagnostic Coverage (DC), Fisher Information Matrices (FIMs), and diagnostic testing budgets. Furthermore, we design empirical-based simulation experiments focusing on two diagnostic testing scenarios: (1) partial tests of a hardware system with overlapping subsystem coverage, and (2) partial tests where one diagnostic test fully subsumes the subsystem coverage of another. We evaluate our proposed approach against the most widely used AL AF in the literature (entropy), as well as several intuitive AL AFs tailored for reliability model parameter inference. Our proposed AF ranked best on average among the alternative AFs across 6,000 experimental configurations, with respect to Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Absolute Total Expected Event Error (ATEER) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) curves, with statistical significance calculated at a 0.05 alpha level using a Friedman hypothesis test.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Reliability and Maintainability Symposium - Europe 2025</p></details> |

However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings. We also show that LLM-SR's incorporation of scientific priors enables more efficient equation space exploration than the baselines.

We find generalization in a Goldilocks zone where the decoder is neither too weak nor too powerful. We then introduce an effective theory for the dynamics of representation learning, where latent-space representations are modeled as interacting particles (repons), and find that it explains our experimentally observed phase transition between generalization and overfitting as encoder and decoder learning rates are scanned. This highlights the power of physics-inspired effective theories for bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and practice in machine learning.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences. This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education.Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview.

We introduce UniVLG, a unified architecture for 2D and 3D vision-language understanding that bridges the gap between existing 2D-centric models and the rich 3D sensory data available in embodied systems. Our approach initializes most model weights from pre-trained 2D models and trains on both 2D and 3D vision-language data. We propose a novel language-conditioned mask decoder shared across 2D and 3D modalities to ground objects effectively in both RGB and RGB-D images, outperforming box-based approaches. To further reduce the domain gap between 2D and 3D, we incorporate 2D-to-3D lifting strategies, enabling UniVLG to utilize 2D data to enhance 3D performance. With these innovations, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D vision-language grounding tasks, demonstrating the potential of transferring advances from 2D vision-language learning to the data-constrained 3D domain. Furthermore, co-training on both 2D and 3D data enhances performance across modalities without sacrificing 2D capabilities.

While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

A fundamental dilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward modeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and tokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual details, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation pipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by maintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while preserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we decouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through post-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from continuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise quantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension, paired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently model the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous methods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates that bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the strengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

However, existing methods often focus on limited domains, require time-consuming optimization per subject, or support only a single subject. We present Video Alchemist $-$ a video model with built-in multi-subject, open-set personalization capabilities for both foreground objects and background, eliminating the need for time-consuming test-time optimization. Our model is built on a new Diffusion Transformer module that fuses each conditional reference image and its corresponding subject-level text prompt with cross-attention layers. Developing such a large model presents two main challenges: dataset and evaluation. First, as paired datasets of reference images and videos are extremely hard to collect, we sample selected video frames as reference images and synthesize a clip of the target video. However, while models can easily denoise training videos given reference frames, they fail to generalize to new contexts. To mitigate this issue, we design a new automatic data construction pipeline with extensive image augmentations. Second, evaluating open-set video personalization is a challenge in itself. To address this, we introduce a personalization benchmark that focuses on accurate subject fidelity and supports diverse personalization scenarios. Finally, our extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

InfU addresses significant issues of existing methods, such as insufficient identity similarity, poor text-image alignment, and low generation quality and aesthetics. Central to InfU is InfuseNet, a component that injects identity features into the DiT base model via residual connections, enhancing identity similarity while maintaining generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with synthetic single-person-multiple-sample (SPMS) data, further improves text-image alignment, ameliorates image quality, and alleviates face copy-pasting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baselines. In addition, the plug-and-play design of InfU ensures compatibility with various existing methods, offering a valuable contribution to the broader community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://bytedance.github.io/InfiniteYou/ Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/InfiniteYou</p></details> |

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 homepage: https://m3-spatial-memory.github.io code: https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial</p></details> |

We propose SA-Occ, the first Satellite-Assisted 3D occupancy prediction model, which leverages GPS & IMU to integrate historical yet readily available satellite imagery into real-time applications, effectively mitigating limitations of ego-vehicle perceptions, involving occlusions and degraded performance in distant regions. To address the core challenges of cross-view perception, we propose: 1) Dynamic-Decoupling Fusion, which resolves inconsistencies in dynamic regions caused by the temporal asynchrony between satellite and street views; 2) 3D-Proj Guidance, a module that enhances 3D feature extraction from inherently 2D satellite imagery; and 3) Uniform Sampling Alignment, which aligns the sampling density between street and satellite views. Evaluated on Occ3D-nuScenes, SA-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially among single-frame methods, with a 39.05% mIoU (a 6.97% improvement), while incurring only 6.93 ms of additional latency per frame. Our code and newly curated dataset are available at https://github.com/chenchen235/SA-Occ.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Masked Mixers for Language Generation and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01482v4)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms that confer selective focus on a strict subset of input elements are nearly ubiquitous in language models today. We posit there to be downside to the use of attention: most input information is lost. In support of this idea we observe poor input representation accuracy in transformers and more accurate representation in what we term masked mixers, which replace self-attention with masked convolutions. The masked mixer learns causal language modeling more efficiently than early transformer implementations and even outperforms optimized, current transformers when training on small ($n_{ctx}<512$) but not larger context windows. Evidence is presented for the hypothesis that differences in transformer and masked mixer training efficiencies for various tasks are best predicted by input representation accuracy, or equivalently global invertibility. We hypothesize that the information loss exhibited by transformers would be more detrimental to retrieval than generation, as the former is more closely approximated by a bijective and thus invertible function. We find that masked mixers are more effective retrieval models both when the pretrained embedding model is unchanged as well as when the embedding model is modified via cosine similarity-based InfoNCE loss minimization. A small masked mixer is shown to outperform a large and near state-of-the-art transformer-based retrieval model, despite the latter being trained with many orders of magnitude more data and compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, 14 supplementary figures, 10 supplementary tables</p></details> |

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on large-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks. However, previous work has primarily focused on action post-training, often neglecting enhancements to the foundational model itself. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Act from Visual Language Post-Training, which refines Visual Language Models (VLMs) through visual and linguistic guidance in a self-supervised manner. This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in world knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world environments. Following the above post-training paradigms, we obtain the first VLA models in Minecraft that can follow human instructions on over 1k different atomic tasks, including crafting, smelting, cooking, mining, and killing. Our experiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a significant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of atomic tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses traditional imitation learning-based policies in Minecraft, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We have open-sourced the code, models, and datasets to foster further research. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/JarvisVLA.</p></details> | 22 pages, 5 figures |

The computational resources and large datasets required, however, limit their applicability in biological contexts. We introduce Lyra, a subquadratic architecture for sequence modeling, grounded in the biological framework of epistasis for understanding sequence-to-function relationships. Mathematically, we demonstrate that state space models efficiently capture global epistatic interactions and combine them with projected gated convolutions for modeling local relationships. We demonstrate that Lyra is performant across over 100 wide-ranging biological tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many key areas, including protein fitness landscape prediction, biophysical property prediction (e.g. disordered protein region functions) peptide engineering applications (e.g. antibody binding, cell-penetrating peptide prediction), RNA structure analysis, RNA function prediction, and CRISPR guide design. It achieves this with orders-of-magnitude improvements in inference speed and reduction in parameters (up to 120,000-fold in our tests) compared to recent biology foundation models. Using Lyra, we were able to train and run every task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing access to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential applications to many fields.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |

In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBRACES, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBRACES refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a 'brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBRACES can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs-including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B-demonstrate that LLMBRACES outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBRACES excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

We introduce UniVLG, a unified architecture for 2D and 3D vision-language understanding that bridges the gap between existing 2D-centric models and the rich 3D sensory data available in embodied systems. Our approach initializes most model weights from pre-trained 2D models and trains on both 2D and 3D vision-language data. We propose a novel language-conditioned mask decoder shared across 2D and 3D modalities to ground objects effectively in both RGB and RGB-D images, outperforming box-based approaches. To further reduce the domain gap between 2D and 3D, we incorporate 2D-to-3D lifting strategies, enabling UniVLG to utilize 2D data to enhance 3D performance. With these innovations, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple 3D vision-language grounding tasks, demonstrating the potential of transferring advances from 2D vision-language learning to the data-constrained 3D domain. Furthermore, co-training on both 2D and 3D data enhances performance across modalities without sacrificing 2D capabilities. By removing the reliance on 3D mesh reconstruction and ground-truth object proposals, UniVLG sets a new standard for realistic, embodied-aligned evaluation.

Existing GFS-PCS methods enhance prototypes via interacting with support or query features but remain limited by sparse knowledge from few-shot samples. Meanwhile, 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs), generalizing across open-world novel classes, contain rich but noisy novel class knowledge. In this work, we introduce a GFS-PCS framework that synergizes dense but noisy pseudo-labels from 3D VLMs with precise yet sparse few-shot samples to maximize the strengths of both, named GFS-VL. Specifically, we present a prototype-guided pseudo-label selection to filter low-quality regions, followed by an adaptive infilling strategy that combines knowledge from pseudo-label contexts and few-shot samples to adaptively label the filtered, unlabeled areas. Additionally, we design a novel-base mix strategy to embed few-shot samples into training scenes, preserving essential context for improved novel class learning. Moreover, recognizing the limited diversity in current GFS-PCS benchmarks, we introduce two challenging benchmarks with diverse novel classes for comprehensive generalization evaluation. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework across models and datasets. Our approach and benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing GFS-PCS in the real world.

Current methods in the literature rely on bulky depth cameras to create maps of the anatomy, however this does not translate well to space-limited clinical applications. Monocular cameras are small and allow minimally invasive surgeries in tight spaces but additional processing is required to generate 3D scene understanding. We propose a 3D mapping pipeline that uses only RGB images to create segmented point clouds of the target anatomy. To ensure the most precise reconstruction, we compare different structure from motion algorithms' performance on mapping the central airway obstructions, and test the pipeline on a downstream task of tumor resection. In several metrics, including post-procedure tissue model evaluation, our pipeline performs comparably to RGB-D cameras and, in some cases, even surpasses their performance. These promising results demonstrate that automation guidance can be achieved in minimally invasive procedures with monocular cameras. This study is a step toward the complete autonomy of surgical robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 8 Figures, 1 Table.

However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Link prediction in bipartite networks finds practical applications in various domains such as product recommendation in online sales, and prediction of chemical-disease interaction in medical science. Since for link prediction, the topological structure of a network contains valuable information, many approaches focus on extracting structural features and then utilizing them for link prediction. Bi-cliques, as a type of structural feature of bipartite graphs, can be utilized for link prediction. Although several link prediction methods utilizing bi-cliques have been proposed and perform well in rather small datasets, all of them face challenges with scalability when dealing with large datasets since they demand substantial computational resources. This limits the practical utility of these approaches in real-world applications. To overcome the limitation, we introduce a novel approach employing iceberg concept lattices and the Transformer encoder. Our method requires fewer computational resources, making it suitable for large-scale datasets while maintaining high prediction performance. We conduct experiments on five large real-world datasets that exceed the capacity of previous bi-clique-based approaches to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Additionally, we perform supplementary experiments on five small datasets to compare with the previous bi-clique-based methods for bipartite link prediction and demonstrate that our method is more efficient than the previous ones.</p></details> | 33 pages, 8 figures |

Recent Unified Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between both paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction, which requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a significant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL framework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our Contrastive objective, "Echo Contrast", leverages the generative capabilities of Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations during training. Sorcen "generates" an echo sample in the semantic token space, forming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on precomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation during training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the previous Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear probing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer learning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen surpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA performance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant improvements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code is available in https://github.com/ImaGonEs/Sorcen</p></details> |

Sensitivity questions are especially critical in contexts, such as topology optimization, that yield structures with emergent morphology. However, analyzing emergent structures via conventional, perturbative techniques can mask larger-scale vulnerabilities that could manifest in essential components. Risks that fail to appear in perturbative sensitivity analyses will only continue to proliferate as topology optimization-driven manufacturing penetrates more deeply into engineering design and consumer products. Here, we introduce Laplace-transform based computational filters that supplement computational morphogenesis with a set of nonperturbative sensitivity analyses. We demonstrate how this approach identifies important elements of a structure even in the absence of knowledge of the ultimate, optimal structure itself. We leverage techniques from molecular dynamics and implement these methods in open-source codes, demonstrating their application to compliance minimization problems in both 2D and 3D. Our implementation extends straightforwardly to topology optimization for other problems and benefits from the strong scaling properties observed in conventional molecular simulation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

In the first part of the paper we prove that square root Lasso $({\tt rLasso})$ with a particular choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda>0$ as well as orthogonal matching pursuit $({\tt OMP})$ after sufficiently many iterations provide noise blind decoders which efficiently recover multivariate functions from random samples. In contrast to basis pursuit the decoders $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ do not require any additional information on the width of the function class in $L_\infty$ and lead to instance optimal recovery guarantees. In the second part of the paper we relate the findings to linear recovery methods such as least squares $({\tt Lsqr})$ or Smolyak's algorithm $({\tt Smolyak})$ and compare the performance in a model situation, namely periodic multivariate functions with $L_p$-bounded mixed derivative will be approximated in $L_q$. The main observation is the fact, that $({\tt rLasso})$ and $({\tt OMP})$ outperform Smolyak's algorithm (sparse grids) in various situations, where $1<p<2\leq q<\infty$. For $q=2$ they even outperform any linear method including $({\tt Lsqr})$ in combination with recently proposed subsampled random points.</p></details> | 2 Figures |

Structural causal models (SCMs) are widely used to represent such causal mechanisms. Given an SCM, causal queries on all three levels of Pearl's causal hierarchy can be answered: $L_1$ observational, $L_2$ interventional, and $L_3$ counterfactual. An essential aspect of modeling the SCM is to model the dependency of each variable on its causal parents. Traditionally this is done by parametric statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression models. This allows to handle all kinds of data types and fit interpretable models but bears the risk of introducing a bias. More recently neural causal models came up using neural networks (NNs) to model the causal relationships, allowing the estimation of nearly any underlying functional form without bias. However, current neural causal models are generally restricted to continuous variables and do not yield an interpretable form of the causal relationships. Transformation models range from simple statistical regressions to complex networks and can handle continuous, ordinal, and binary data. Here, we propose to use TRAMs to model the functional relationships in SCMs allowing us to bridge the gap between interpretability and flexibility in causal modeling. We call this method TRAM-DAG and assume currently that the underlying directed acyclic graph is known. For the fully observed case, we benchmark TRAM-DAGs against state-of-the-art statistical and NN-based causal models. We show that TRAM-DAGs are interpretable but also achieve equal or superior performance in queries ranging from $L_1$ to $L_3$ in the causal hierarchy. For the continuous case, TRAM-DAGs allow for counterfactual queries for three common causal structures, including unobserved confounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the CLeaR 2025 Conference</p></details> |

It ensures high-quality imaging in VBMS, which is fundamental for reliable visual measurement and analysis. However, imaging quality can be significantly impaired by adverse weather conditions, particularly rain, leading to blurred images and reduced contrast. Such impairments increase the risk of inaccurate evaluations and misinterpretations in VBMS. To address these limitations, we propose an Expectation Maximization Reconstruction Transformer (EMResformer) for single image rain streak removal. The EMResformer retains the key self-attention values for feature aggregation, enhancing local features to produce superior image reconstruction. Specifically, we propose an Expectation Maximization Block seamlessly integrated into the single image rain streak removal network, enhancing its ability to eliminate superfluous information and restore a cleaner background image. Additionally, to further enhance local information for improved detail rendition, we introduce a Local Model Residual Block, which integrates two local model blocks along with a sequence of convolutions and activation functions. This integration synergistically facilitates the extraction of more pertinent features for enhanced single image rain streak removal. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed EMResformer surpasses current state-of-the-art single image rain streak removal methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving an improved balance between model complexity and single image deraining performance. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method in VBMS scenarios, demonstrating that high-quality imaging significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of VBMS tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, the fundamental reliance of self-attention layers on positional embedding versus query-key similarity during generation remains an intriguing question. We present the first mechanistic analysis of RoPE-based MMDiT models (e.g., FLUX), introducing an automated probing strategy that disentangles positional information versus content dependencies by strategically manipulating RoPE during generation. Our analysis reveals distinct dependency patterns that do not straightforwardly correlate with depth, offering new insights into the layer-specific roles in RoPE-based MMDiT. Based on these findings, we propose a training-free, task-specific image editing framework that categorizes editing tasks into three types: position-dependent editing (e.g., object addition), content similarity-dependent editing (e.g., non-rigid editing), and region-preserved editing (e.g., background replacement). For each type, we design tailored key-value injection strategies based on the characteristics of the editing task. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in preserving original semantic content and achieving seamless modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wtybest.github.io/projects/FreeFlux/</p></details> |

However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability.

| **[Probabilistic Prompt Distribution Learning for Animal Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16120v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-species animal pose estimation has emerged as a challenging yet critical task, hindered by substantial visual diversity and uncertainty. This paper challenges the problem by efficient prompt learning for Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, \textit{e.g.} CLIP, aiming to resolve the cross-species generalization problem. At the core of the solution lies in the prompt designing, probabilistic prompt modeling and cross-modal adaptation, thereby enabling prompts to compensate for cross-modal information and effectively overcome large data variances under unbalanced data distribution. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic prompting approach to fully explore textual descriptions, which could alleviate the diversity issues caused by long-tail property and increase the adaptability of prompts on unseen category instance. Specifically, we first introduce a set of learnable prompts and propose a diversity loss to maintain distinctiveness among prompts, thus representing diverse image attributes. Diverse textual probabilistic representations are sampled and used as the guidance for the pose estimation.

Promptus emerges as a new paradigm for video streaming, substantially cutting down the bandwidth essential for video streaming. However, Promptus is computationally intensive and can not run in real-time on mobile devices. This paper presents PromptMobile, an efficient acceleration framework tailored for on-device Promptus. Specifically, we propose (1) a two-stage efficient generation framework to reduce computational cost by 8.1x, (2) a fine-grained inter-frame caching to reduce redundant computations by 16.6\%, (3) system-level optimizations to further enhance efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that compared with the original Promptus, PromptMobile achieves a 13.6x increase in image generation speed. Compared with other streaming methods, PromptMobile achives an average LPIPS improvement of 0.016 (compared with H.265), reducing 60\% of severely distorted frames (compared to VQGAN).</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

We start by adapting an existing next-scale prediction autoregressive (AR) architecture to T2I generation, investigating and mitigating training stability issues in the process. Next, we argue that scale-wise transformers do not require causality and propose a non-causal counterpart facilitating ~21% faster sampling and lower memory usage while also achieving slightly better generation quality. Furthermore, we reveal that classifier-free guidance at high-resolution scales is often unnecessary and can even degrade performance. By disabling guidance at these scales, we achieve an additional sampling acceleration of ~32% and improve the generation of fine-grained details. Extensive human preference studies and automated evaluations show that Switti outperforms existing T2I AR models and competes with state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models while being up to 7x faster.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Transformation trees -- documentation of multimodal image registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19140v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal image registration plays a key role in creating digital patient models by combining data from different imaging techniques into a single coordinate system. This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

This study presents an automated solution for detecting foreign objects on pork belly meat using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A hyperspectral camera was used to capture data across various bands in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum (900-1700 nm), enabling accurate identification of contaminants that are often undetectable through traditional visual inspection methods. The proposed solution combines pre-processing techniques with a segmentation approach based on a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) to distinguish contaminants from meat, fat, and conveyor belt materials. The adopted strategy demonstrates high detection accuracy and training efficiency, while also addressing key industrial challenges such as inherent noise, temperature variations, and spectral similarity between contaminants and pork belly. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of hyperspectral imaging in enhancing food safety, highlighting its potential for broad real-time applications in automated quality control processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article under review by Computers in Industry, Elsevier</p></details> |

A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis.

Building on this, we use the directions between hidden states with opposing features to fit control vectors. At inference, we add our control vectors to hidden states and evaluate their impact on predictions. Remarkably, such modifications preserve the feasibility of predictions. We further refine our control vectors using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). This leads to more linear changes in predictions when scaling control vectors. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretation as well as zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready.

Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this line of research by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. We also present a theoretical analysis on how the accuracy estimator variance depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. Finally, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms training on real data mined from the dataset used in the original diffusion model training.

A widely used paradigm is to pretrain neural networks on string representations of molecules and fine-tune them using reinforcement learning on specific objectives. However, string-based models face challenges in ensuring chemical validity and enforcing structural constraints like the presence of specific substructures. We propose to instead combine graph-based molecular representations, which can naturally ensure chemical validity, with transformer architectures, which are highly expressive and capable of modeling long-range dependencies between atoms. Our approach iteratively modifies a molecular graph by adding atoms and bonds, which ensures chemical validity and facilitates the incorporation of structural constraints. We present GraphXForm, a decoder-only graph transformer architecture, which is pretrained on existing compounds and then fine-tuned using a new training algorithm that combines elements of the deep cross-entropy method and self-improvement learning. We evaluate GraphXForm on various drug design tasks, demonstrating superior objective scores compared to state-of-the-art molecular design approaches. Furthermore, we apply GraphXForm to two solvent design tasks for liquid-liquid extraction, again outperforming alternative methods while flexibly enforcing structural constraints or initiating design from existing molecular structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Digital Discovery, 2025</p></details> |

However, contemporary methods exhibit significant limitations in semantic preservation, contextual integrity, and information redundancy, which constrains retrieval efficacy. We present PromptHash, an innovative framework leveraging affinity prompt-aware collaborative learning for adaptive cross-modal hashing. We propose an end-to-end framework for affinity-prompted collaborative hashing, with the following fundamental technical contributions: (i) a text affinity prompt learning mechanism that preserves contextual information while maintaining parameter efficiency, (ii) an adaptive gated selection fusion architecture that synthesizes State Space Model with Transformer network for precise cross-modal feature integration, and (iii) a prompt affinity alignment strategy that bridges modal heterogeneity through hierarchical contrastive learning. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first investigation into affinity prompt awareness within collaborative cross-modal adaptive hash learning, establishing a paradigm for enhanced semantic consistency across modalities. Through comprehensive evaluation on three benchmark multi-label datasets, PromptHash demonstrates substantial performance improvements over existing approaches. Notably, on the NUS-WIDE dataset, our method achieves significant gains of 18.22% and 18.65% in image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks, respectively.

However, real-world videos encompass omni-modal information (vision, audio, and speech) with a series of events forming a cohesive storyline. The lack of multi-modal video data with fine-grained event annotations and the high cost of manual labeling are major obstacles to comprehensive omni-modality video perception. To address this gap, we propose an automatic pipeline consisting of high-quality multi-modal video filtering, semantically coherent omni-modal event boundary detection, and cross-modal correlation-aware event captioning. In this way, we present LongVALE, the first-ever Vision-Audio-Language Event understanding benchmark comprising 105K omni-modal events with precise temporal boundaries and detailed relation-aware captions within 8.4K high-quality long videos. Further, we build a baseline that leverages LongVALE to enable video large language models (LLMs) for omni-modality fine-grained temporal video understanding for the first time. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of LongVALE in advancing comprehensive multi-modal video understanding.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, the current implementation of UDC causes serious degradation. The incident light required for camera imaging undergoes attenuation and diffraction when passing through the display panel, leading to various artifacts in UDC imaging. Presently, the prevailing UDC image restoration methods predominantly utilize convolutional neural network architectures, whereas Transformer-based methods have exhibited superior performance in the majority of image restoration tasks. This is attributed to the Transformer's capability to sample global features for the local reconstruction of images, thereby achieving high-quality image restoration. In this paper, we observe that when using the Vision Transformer for UDC degraded image restoration, the global attention samples a large amount of redundant information and noise. Furthermore, compared to the ordinary Transformer employing dense attention, the Transformer utilizing sparse attention can alleviate the adverse impact of redundant information and noise. Building upon this discovery, we propose a Segmentation Guided Sparse Transformer method (SGSFormer) for the task of restoring high-quality images from UDC degraded images. Specifically, we utilize sparse self-attention to filter out redundant information and noise, directing the model's attention to focus on the features more relevant to the degraded regions in need of reconstruction. Moreover, we integrate the instance segmentation map as prior information to guide the sparse self-attention in filtering and focusing on the correct regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, conference or other essential info</p></details> |

These systems often require clear and detailed images for precise object detection and recognition. However, images captured by visual measurement tools frequently suffer from degradation, including blurring and loss of detail, which can impede measurement accuracy.As a potential remedy, we in this paper propose a Semantic-Guided Global-Local Collaborative Network (SGGLC-Net) for lightweight SISR. Our SGGLC-Net leverages semantic priors extracted from a pre-trained model to guide the super-resolution process, enhancing image detail quality effectively. Specifically,we propose a Semantic Guidance Module that seamlessly integrates the semantic priors into the super-resolution network, enabling the network to more adeptly capture and utilize semantic priors, thereby enhancing image details. To further explore both local and non-local interactions for improved detail rendition,we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Module, which features three Global and Local Detail Enhancement Modules, as well as a Hybrid Attention Mechanism to work together to efficiently learn more useful features. Our extensive experiments show that SGGLC-Net achieves competitive PSNR and SSIM values across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating higher performance with the multi-adds reduction of 12.81G compared to state-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution approaches. These improvements underscore the potential of our approach to enhance the precision and effectiveness of visual measurement systems.

In order to overcome these obstacles, we introduce a novel two stage unsupervised segmentation approach that requires no human annotations and combines artificially created and real images. Our method generates challenging synthetic training data, by placing virtual fish in real-world underwater habitats, after performing fish transformations such as Thin Plate Spline shape warping and color Histogram Matching, which realistically integrate synthetic fish into the backgrounds, making the generated images increasingly closer to the real world data with every stage of our approach. While we validate our unsupervised method on the popular DeepFish dataset, obtaining a performance close to a fully-supervised SoTA model, we further show its effectiveness on the specific case of salmon segmentation in underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature (30 GB). Moreover, on both datasets we prove the capability of our approach to boost the performance of the fully-supervised SoTA model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ECCVW 2024</p></details> |

Traditional detection methods, including statistical and rule-based models, struggle to adapt to evolving attack patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Temporal-Spatial Attention Network (TSAN) architecture for detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in network traffic. By leveraging both temporal and spatial features of network traffic, our approach captures complex traffic patterns and anomalies that traditional methods might miss. The TSAN model incorporates transformer-based temporal encoding, convolutional spatial encoding, and a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these complementary feature spaces. Additionally, we employ multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks to enhance the model's robustness. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that TSAN outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment. The proposed architecture offers an optimal balance between detection accuracy and computational overhead, making it highly suitable for real-world network security applications.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 5 figures |
| **[Hybrid-Level Instruction Injection for Video Token Compression in Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16036v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been challenged by the computational overhead resulting from massive video frames, often alleviated through compression strategies. However, the visual content is not equally contributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\eg, average pool) inevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this, we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K. Experiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding ability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43\% average on three multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8\% tokens compared with the SOTA method.

Despite its effectiveness, ICL is prone to errors, especially for challenging examples. With the goal of improving the performance of ICL, we propose corrective in-context learning (CICL), an approach that incorporates a model's incorrect predictions alongside ground truth corrections into the prompt, aiming to enhance classification accuracy through self-correction. However, contrary to our hypothesis, extensive experiments on text classification tasks demonstrate that CICL consistently underperforms standard ICL, with performance degrading as the proportion of corrections in the prompt increases. Our findings indicate that CICL introduces confusion by disrupting the model's task understanding, rather than refining its predictions. Additionally, we observe that presenting harder examples in standard ICL does not improve performance, suggesting that example difficulty alone may not be a reliable criterion for effective selection. By presenting these negative results, we provide important insights into the limitations of self-corrective mechanisms in LLMs and offer directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 6th Workshop on Insights from Negative Results in NLP at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Block-sparse attention mitigates this by focusing computation on critical regions, yet existing methods struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency due to costly block importance measurements. In this paper, we introduce XAttention, a plug-and-play framework that dramatically accelerates long-context inference in Transformers models using sparse attention. XAttention's key innovation is the insight that the sum of antidiagonal values (i.e., from the lower-left to upper-right) in the attention matrix provides a powerful proxy for block importance. This allows for precise identification and pruning of non-essential blocks, resulting in high sparsity and dramatically accelerated inference. Across comprehensive evaluations on demanding long-context benchmarks-including RULER and LongBench for language, VideoMME for video understanding, and VBench for video generation. XAttention achieves accuracy comparable to full attention while delivering substantial computational gains. We demonstrate up to 13.5x acceleration in attention computation. These results underscore XAttention's ability to unlock the practical potential of block sparse attention, paving the way for scalable and efficient deployment of LCTMs in real-world applications.

Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have further improved performance in System-2 reasoning domains like mathematics and programming by harnessing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, while longer CoT reasoning sequences improve performance, they also introduce significant computational overhead due to verbose and redundant outputs, known as the "overthinking phenomenon". In this paper, we provide the first structured survey to systematically investigate and explore the current progress toward achieving efficient reasoning in LLMs. Overall, relying on the inherent mechanism of LLMs, we categorize existing works into several key directions: (1) model-based efficient reasoning, which considers optimizing full-length reasoning models into more concise reasoning models or directly training efficient reasoning models; (2) reasoning output-based efficient reasoning, which aims to dynamically reduce reasoning steps and length during inference; (3) input prompts-based efficient reasoning, which seeks to enhance reasoning efficiency based on input prompt properties such as difficulty or length control. Additionally, we introduce the use of efficient data for training reasoning models, explore the reasoning capabilities of small language models, and discuss evaluation methods and benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://github.com/Eclipsess/Awesome-Efficient-Reasoning-LLMs</p></details> |

By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 homepage: https://m3-spatial-memory.github.io code: https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial</p></details> |

Deep learning models have achieved high performance, but often fail when the training and inference environments differ. Adapting SSL models to dynamic acoustic conditions faces a major challenge: catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose an exemplar-free continual learning strategy for SSL (CL-SSL) to address such a forgetting phenomenon. CL-SSL applies task-specific sub-networks to adapt across diverse acoustic environments while retaining previously learned knowledge. It also uses a scaling mechanism to limit parameter growth, ensuring consistent performance across incremental tasks. We evaluated CL-SSL on simulated data with varying microphone distances and real-world data with different noise levels. The results demonstrate CL-SSL's ability to maintain high accuracy with minimal parameter increase, offering an efficient solution for SSL applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |

| **[Efficient Multi-Cycle Folded Integer Multipliers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13332v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast combinational multipliers with large bit widths can occupy significant silicon area, which also drives up power consumption. Area can be reduced through resource sharing (i.e., folding) at the expense of lower throughput, which is acceptable for some applications. This work explores multiple architectures for Multi-Cycle folded Integer Multiplier (MCIM) designs, which are based on Schoolbook and Karatsuba approaches. Applications sometimes require a fractional number of multiplications to be performed per cycle. For example, an algorithm may only require 3.5 multiplications per cycle. In such a case, 3 multipliers with a throughput of 1 plus an additional smaller multiplier with a throughput of $1/2$ would be sufficient to maintain the algorithm's throughput. Our MCIM design generator offers customization in terms of throughput, latency, and clock frequency. MCIM designs were synthesized and verified for various parameter values using scripts. ASIC synthesis results show that MCIM designs with a throughput of $1/2$ offer area savings of up to 44% for bit widths of 8 to 128 with respect to directly synthesizing the * operator. Additionally, MCIM designs can offer up to 33% energy savings and 65% average peak power reduction.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they struggle to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that depend on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we observe that current layer-localized KE approaches, such as MEMIT and WISE, which edit only single or a few model layers, struggle to effectively incorporate updated information into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we propose CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enables more effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. CaKE leverages strategically curated data, guided by our circuits-based analysis, that enforces the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly integrated knowledge. Experimental results show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of updated knowledge across related reasoning tasks, leading to an average of 20% improvement in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on MQuAKE dataset compared to existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</p></details> | Work in progress |

The computational resources and large datasets required, however, limit their applicability in biological contexts. We introduce Lyra, a subquadratic architecture for sequence modeling, grounded in the biological framework of epistasis for understanding sequence-to-function relationships. Mathematically, we demonstrate that state space models efficiently capture global epistatic interactions and combine them with projected gated convolutions for modeling local relationships. We demonstrate that Lyra is performant across over 100 wide-ranging biological tasks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many key areas, including protein fitness landscape prediction, biophysical property prediction (e.g. disordered protein region functions) peptide engineering applications (e.g. antibody binding, cell-penetrating peptide prediction), RNA structure analysis, RNA function prediction, and CRISPR guide design. It achieves this with orders-of-magnitude improvements in inference speed and reduction in parameters (up to 120,000-fold in our tests) compared to recent biology foundation models. Using Lyra, we were able to train and run every task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing access to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential applications to many fields.</p></details> | 53 pages, 5 figures |

Active Learning (AL) has shown promise for parameter inference with limited data and budget constraints in machine learning/deep learning tasks. However, AL for reliability model parameter inference remains underexplored for repairable hardware systems. It requires specialized AL Acquisition Functions (AFs) that consider hardware aging and the fact that a hardware system consists of multiple sub-systems, which may undergo only partial testing during a given diagnostic test. To address these challenges, we propose a relaxed Mixed Integer Semidefinite Program (MISDP) AL AF that incorporates Diagnostic Coverage (DC), Fisher Information Matrices (FIMs), and diagnostic testing budgets. Furthermore, we design empirical-based simulation experiments focusing on two diagnostic testing scenarios: (1) partial tests of a hardware system with overlapping subsystem coverage, and (2) partial tests where one diagnostic test fully subsumes the subsystem coverage of another. We evaluate our proposed approach against the most widely used AL AF in the literature (entropy), as well as several intuitive AL AFs tailored for reliability model parameter inference. Our proposed AF ranked best on average among the alternative AFs across 6,000 experimental configurations, with respect to Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Absolute Total Expected Event Error (ATEER) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) curves, with statistical significance calculated at a 0.05 alpha level using a Friedman hypothesis test.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Reliability and Maintainability Symposium - Europe 2025</p></details> |

LLMs have a wide range of application value in the field of humanities and social sciences because of its strong text understanding, generation and reasoning capabilities. In humanities and social sciences research, LLMs can analyze large-scale text data and make inferences. This article analyzes the large language model DeepSeek-R1 from seven aspects: low-resource language translation, educational question-answering, student writing improvement in higher education, logical reasoning, educational measurement and psychometrics, public health policy analysis, and art education.Then we compare the answers given by DeepSeek-R1 in the seven aspects with the answers given by o1-preview. DeepSeek-R1 performs well in the humanities and social sciences, answering most questions correctly and logically, and can give reasonable analysis processes and explanations. Compared with o1-preview, it can automatically generate reasoning processes and provide more detailed explanations, which is suitable for beginners or people who need to have a detailed understanding of this knowledge, while o1-preview is more suitable for quick reading. Through analysis, it is found that LLM has broad application potential in the field of humanities and social sciences, and shows great advantages in improving text analysis efficiency, language communication and other fields. LLM's powerful language understanding and generation capabilities enable it to deeply explore complex problems in the field of humanities and social sciences, and provide innovative tools for academic research and practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2409.18486</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing Vecset Diffusion Model for Fast Shape Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16302v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape generation has greatly flourished through the development of so-called "native" 3D diffusion, particularly through the Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM). While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic evaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D generation methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art while reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for generation.

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Recent research indicates that despite training-time safety alignment, these models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In this work, we first highlight an important safety gap to describe that alignment achieved solely through safety training may be insufficient against jailbreak attacks. To address this vulnerability, we propose Immune, an inference-time defense framework that leverages a safe reward model through controlled decoding to defend against jailbreak attacks. Additionally, we provide a mathematical characterization of Immune, offering insights on why it improves safety against jailbreaks. Extensive evaluations on diverse jailbreak benchmarks using recent MLLMs reveal that Immune effectively enhances model safety while preserving the model's original capabilities. For instance, against text-based jailbreak attacks on LLaVA-1.6, Immune reduces the attack success rate by 57.82% and 16.78% compared to the base MLLM and state-of-the-art defense strategy, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Plug-and-Play 1.x-Bit KV Cache Quantization for Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16257v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (VideoLLMs) have demonstrated the capability to process longer video inputs and enable complex reasoning and analysis. However, due to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV) cache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for inference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used approach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV quantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the limit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To bridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization method to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for key, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel dimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit quantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement 1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual tokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and model performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of VideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token fashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically, extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit precision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.</p></details> | 12 pages |

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 17 figures |

To address this issue, we propose a simple three-step approach,Project-Probe-Aggregate (PPA), that enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundation models without relying on group annotations. Building upon the failure-based debiasing scheme, our method, PPA, improves its two key components: minority samples identification and the robust training algorithm. Specifically, we first train biased classifiers by projecting image features onto the nullspace of class proxies from text encoders. Next, we infer group labels using the biased classifier and probe group targets with prior correction. Finally, we aggregate group weights of each class to produce the debiased classifier. Our theoretical analysis shows that our PPA enhances minority group identification and is Bayes optimal for minimizing the balanced group error, mitigating spurious correlations. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our PPA: it outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average worst-group accuracy while requiring less than 0.01% tunable parameters without training group labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-subject Test Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15419v5)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abnormality detection in identifying a single-subject which deviates from the majority of a control group dataset is a fundamental problem. Typically, the control group is characterised using standard Normal statistics, and the detection of a single abnormal subject is in that context. However, in many situations, the control group cannot be described by Normal statistics, making standard statistical methods inappropriate. This paper presents a Bayesian Inference General Procedures for A Single-subject Test (BIGPAST) designed to mitigate the effects of skewness under the assumption that the dataset of the control group comes from the skewed Student \( t \) distribution. BIGPAST operates under the null hypothesis that the single-subject follows the same distribution as the control group. We assess BIGPAST's performance against other methods through simulation studies. The results demonstrate that BIGPAST is robust against deviations from normality and outperforms the existing approaches in accuracy nearest to the nominal accuracy 0.95. BIGPAST can reduce model misspecification errors under the skewed Student $t$ assumption by up to 12 times, as demonstrated in Section 3.3. We apply BIGPAST to a Magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset consisting of an individual with mild traumatic brain injury and an age and gender-matched control group. For example, the previous method failed to detect abnormalities in 8 brain areas, whereas BIGPAST successfully identified them, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting abnormalities in a single-subject.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 13 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |

However, applying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data through vector quantization methods like VQ-VAE. To alleviate the quantization errors that existed in VQ-VAE, recent works tend to use larger codebooks. However, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the autoregressive modeling task. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the benefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more difficult. Through empirical investigation, we discover that tokens with similar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated image, revealing significant redundancy in large codebooks. Based on this insight, we propose to predict tokens from coarse to fine (CTF), realized by assigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. Our framework consists of two stages: (1) an autoregressive model that sequentially predicts coarse labels for each token in the sequence, and (2) an auxiliary model that simultaneously predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their coarse labels. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate our method's superior performance, achieving an average improvement of 59 points in Inception Score compared to baselines. Notably, despite adding an inference step, our approach achieves faster sampling speeds.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Recent research has shown that although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are initially poor at image classification, fine-tuning them with an adequate amount of data can significantly enhance their performance, making them comparable to SOTA classification models. However, acquiring large-scale labeled data is expensive. In this paper, we explore few-shot MLLM classification fine-tuning. We found that SFT can cause severe overfitting issues and may even degrade performance over the zero-shot approach. To address this challenge, inspired by the recent successes in rule-based reinforcement learning, we propose CLS-RL, which uses verifiable signals as reward to fine-tune MLLMs. We discovered that CLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has a much higher average accuracy on both base-to-new and few-shot learning setting. Moreover, we observed a free-lunch phenomenon for CLS-RL; when models are fine-tuned on a particular dataset, their performance on other distinct datasets may also improve over zero-shot models, even if those datasets differ in distribution and class names. This suggests that RL-based methods effectively teach models the fundamentals of classification. Lastly, inspired by recent works in inference time thinking, we re-examine the `thinking process' during fine-tuning, a critical aspect of RL-based methods, in the context of visual classification. We question whether such tasks require extensive thinking process during fine-tuning, proposing that this may actually detract from performance. Based on this premise, we introduce the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes thinking processes during training by setting an equality accuracy reward. Our findings indicate that, with much less fine-tuning time, No-Thinking-CLS-RL method achieves superior in-domain performance and generalization capabilities than CLS-RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |

The well-known issue of RRT* is its slow convergence towards the optimal solution. A possible solution is to draw random samples only from a subset of the configuration space that is known to contain configurations that can improve the cost of the path (omniscient set). A fast convergence rate may be achieved by approximating the omniscient with a low-volume set. In this letter, we propose new methods to approximate the omniscient set and methods for their effective sampling. First, we propose to approximate the omniscient set using several (small) hyperellipsoids defined by sections of the current best solution. The second approach approximates the omniscient set by a convex hull computed from the current solution. Both approaches ensure asymptotical optimality and work in a general n-dimensional configuration space. The experiments have shown superior performance of our approaches in multiple scenarios in 3D and 6D configuration spaces.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures |

Traditional approaches often rely on centralized orchestration to partition tasks among nodes. However, these methods struggle with communication bottlenecks, latency, and reliability when the swarm grows or the topology shifts rapidly. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fully distributed, diffusive metric-based approach for split computing in UAV swarms. Our solution introduces a new iterative measure, termed the aggregated gigaflops, capturing each node's own computing capacity along with that of its neighbors without requiring global network knowledge. By forwarding partial inferences intelligently to underutilized nodes, we achieve improved task throughput, lower latency, and enhanced energy efficiency. Further, to handle sudden workload surges and rapidly changing node conditions, we incorporate an early-exit mechanism that can adapt the inference pathway on-the-fly. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline strategies across multiple performance indices, including latency, fairness, and energy consumption. These results highlight the feasibility of large-scale distributed intelligence in UAV swarms and provide a blueprint for deploying robust, scalable ML services in diverse aerial networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |

Our testbed is the Russian Far East in the summers of 2022 and 2023. Remotely sensed data from NASA's Aqua spacecraft are organized into a within-subject design that can reduce nuisance variation in forecasted temperatures. Spatial grid cells are the study units. Each is exposed to precursors of a faux heat wave in 2022 and to precursors of a reported heat wave in 2023. The precursors are used to forecast temperatures two weeks in the future for each of 31 consecutive days. Algorithmic fitting procedures produce forecasts with promise and relatively small conformal prediction regions having a coverage probability of at least .75. Spatial and temporal dependence are manageable. At worst, there is weak dependence such that conformal prediction inference is only asymptotically valid.</p></details> | 8 figures, 28 pages |

While prompt-based methods using models like CLIP have advanced DG, they falter in low-data regimes (e.g., 1-shot) and lack precision in detecting open-set samples with fine-grained semantics related to training classes. To address these challenges, we propose OSLOPROMPT, an advanced prompt-learning framework for CLIP with two core innovations. First, to manage limited supervision across source domains and improve DG, we introduce a domain-agnostic prompt-learning mechanism that integrates adaptable domain-specific cues and visually guided semantic attributes through a novel cross-attention module, besides being supported by learnable domain- and class-generic visual prompts to enhance cross-modal adaptability. Second, to improve outlier rejection during inference, we classify unfamiliar samples as "unknown" and train specialized prompts with systematically synthesized pseudo-open samples that maintain fine-grained relationships to known classes, generated through a targeted query strategy with off-the-shelf foundation models. This strategy enhances feature learning, enabling our model to detect open samples with varied granularity more effectively. Extensive evaluations across five benchmarks demonstrate that OSLOPROMPT establishes a new state-of-the-art in LSOSDG, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we analyze hidden states and modify them at inference, with a focus on motion forecasting. We use linear probing to analyze whether interpretable features are embedded in hidden states. Our experiments reveal high probing accuracy, indicating latent space regularities with functionally important directions. Building on this, we use the directions between hidden states with opposing features to fit control vectors. At inference, we add our control vectors to hidden states and evaluate their impact on predictions. Remarkably, such modifications preserve the feasibility of predictions. We further refine our control vectors using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). This leads to more linear changes in predictions when scaling control vectors. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretation as well as zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera-ready.

Recent vision foundation models show excellent few-shot transfer abilities, but are large and slow at inference. Using knowledge distillation, the capabilities of high-performing but slow models can be transferred to tiny, efficient models. However, common distillation methods require a large set of unlabeled data, which is not available in the few-shot setting. To overcome this lack of data, there has been a recent interest in using synthetic data. We expand on this line of research by presenting a novel diffusion model inversion technique (TINT) combining the diversity of textual inversion with the specificity of null-text inversion. Using this method in a few-shot distillation pipeline leads to state-of-the-art accuracy among small student models on popular benchmarks, while being significantly faster than prior work. Popular few-shot benchmarks involve evaluation over a large number of episodes, which is computationally cumbersome for methods involving synthetic data generation. We also present a theoretical analysis on how the accuracy estimator variance depends on the number of episodes and query examples, and use these results to lower the computational effort required for method evaluation. Finally, to further motivate the use of generative models in few-shot distillation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms training on real data mined from the dataset used in the original diffusion model training.

In the inverse problem of PDEs, parameters are defined on an infinite-dimensional function space, and the PDEs induce a computationally intensive likelihood function. Additionally, sparse data tends to lead to a multi-modal posterior. These features make it difficult to apply existing sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms. To overcome these difficulties, we propose new conditions for the likelihood functions, construct a Gaussian mixture based preconditioned Crank-Nicolson transition kernel, and demonstrate the universal approximation property of the infinite-dimensional Gaussian mixture probability measure. By combining these three novel tools, we propose a new SMC algorithm, named SMC-GM. For this new algorithm, we obtain a convergence theorem that allows Gaussian priors, illustrating that the sequential particle filter actually reproduces the true posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed new algorithm is rigorously defined on the infinite-dimensional function space, naturally exhibiting the discretization-invariant property. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new approach has a strong ability to probe the multi-modality of the posterior, significantly reduces the computational burden, and numerically exhibits the discretization-invariant property (important for large-scale problems).</p></details> | 35 pages |

I introduce feedback-augmented non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (FAN-HMM), which incorporate time-varying covariates and feedback mechanisms from past observations to latent states and future responses. Integrating these models with the structural causal model framework allows flexible causal inference in longitudinal data with time-varying unobserved heterogeneity and multiple causal pathways. I show how, in a common case of categorical response variables, long-term causal effects can be estimated efficiently without the need for simulating counterfactual trajectories. Using simulation experiments, I study the performance of FAN-HMM under the common misspecification of the number of latent states, and finally apply the proposed approach to estimate the effect of the 2013 parental leave reform on fathers' paternal leave uptake in Finnish workplaces.</p></details> | 30 pages, 12 figures |

Unlike traditional AD benchmarks with fixed anomaly criteria, our task detects anomalies specific to each scene by inferring a reference group of regular objects. To address occlusions, we use multiple views of each scene as input, construct 3D object-centric models for each instance from 2D views, enhancing these models with geometrically consistent part-aware representations. Anomalous objects are then detected through cross-instance comparison. We also introduce two new benchmarks, ToysAD-8K and PartsAD-15K as testbeds for future research in this task. We provide a comprehensive analysis of our method quantitatively and qualitatively on these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes & Dataset at https://github.com/VICO-UoE/OddOneOutAD</p></details> |

Training performant detection models require diverse, precisely annotated, and large scale datasets that involve complex and expensive creation processes. Hence, there are only few public 3D datasets that are additionally limited in their range of classes. In this work, we propose a pipeline for automatic generation of 3D datasets for arbitrary objects. By utilizing the universal 3D representation and rendering capabilities of Radiance Fields, our pipeline generates high quality 3D models for arbitrary objects. These 3D models serve as input for a synthetic dataset generator. Our pipeline is fast, easy to use and has a high degree of automation. Our experiments demonstrate, that 3D pose estimation networks, trained with our generated datasets, archive strong performance in typical application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at ROBOVIS 2025 (5th International Conference on Robotics, Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems)</p></details> |
| **[Differentially Private Steering for Large Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18532v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our PSA algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready; Code: https://github.com/UKPLab/iclr2025-psa</p></details> |

We study the false coverage proportion (FCP) in a transductive setting with a calibration sample of $n$ points and a test sample of $m$ points. We identify the exact, distribution-free, asymptotic distribution of the FCP when both $n$ and $m$ tend to infinity. This shows in particular that FCP control can be achieved by using the well-known Kolmogorov distribution, and puts forward that the asymptotic variance is decreasing in the ratio $n/m$. We then provide a number of extensions by considering the novelty detection problem, weighted conformal inference and distribution shift between the calibration sample and the test sample. In particular, our asymptotic results allow to accurately quantify the asymptotic behavior of the errors when weighted conformal inference is used.</p></details> | 28 pages, 2 figures |
| **[General Bayesian inference for causal effects using covariate balancing procedure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09414v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In observational studies, the propensity score plays a central role in estimating causal effects of interest. The inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator is commonly used for this purpose. However, if the propensity score model is misspecified, the IPW estimator may produce biased estimates of causal effects. Previous studies have proposed some robust propensity score estimation procedures. However, these methods require considering parameters that dominate the uncertainty of sampling and treatment allocation. This study proposes a novel Bayesian estimating procedure that necessitates probabilistically deciding the parameter, rather than deterministically. Since the IPW estimator and propensity score estimator can be derived as solutions to certain loss functions, the general Bayesian paradigm, which does not require the considering the full likelihood, can be applied. Therefore, our proposed method only requires the same level of assumptions as ordinary causal inference contexts. The proposed Bayesian method demonstrates equal or superior results compared to some previous methods in simulation experimentss, and is also applied to real data, namely the Whitehall dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>covar...</summary><p>covariate balancing, general Bayes, inverse probability weighting, M-estimator, propensity score</p></details> |

Contrary to synthetic data generators that achieve DP by globally adding noise, TVineSynth performs a controlled approximation of the estimated data generating distribution, so that it does not suffer from poor utility of the resulting synthetic data for downstream prediction tasks. TVineSynth introduces a targeted bias into the vine copula model that, combined with the specific tree structure of the vine, causes the model to zero out privacy-leaking dependencies while relying on those that are beneficial for utility. Privacy is here measured with membership (MIA) and attribute inference attacks (AIA). Further, we theoretically justify how the construction of TVineSynth ensures AIA privacy under a natural privacy measure for continuous sensitive attributes. When compared to competitor models, with and without DP, on simulated and on real-world data, TVineSynth achieves a superior privacy-utility balance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> |

For example, an image of Albert Einstein holding a smartphone violates common-sense because modern smartphone were invented after Einstein's death. We introduce a novel method for assessing image realism using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our approach is based on the premise that LVLMs may generate hallucinations when confronted with images that defy common sense. Using LVLM to extract atomic facts from these images, we obtain a mix of accurate facts and erroneous hallucinations. We proceed by calculating pairwise entailment scores among these facts, subsequently aggregating these values to yield a singular reality score. This process serves to identify contradictions between genuine facts and hallucinatory elements, signaling the presence of images that violate common sense. Our approach has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot mode on the WHOOPS! dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of De-Factify 4: 4nd Workshop on Multimodal Fact Checking and Hate Speech Detection, co-located with AAAI-2025</p></details> |

Among these descriptors, GeDi has demonstrated strong zero-shot 6D pose estimation capabilities but remains computationally impractical for real-world applications due to its expensive inference process. Can we retain GeDi's effectiveness while significantly improving its efficiency? In this paper, we explore this question by introducing a knowledge distillation framework that trains an efficient student model to regress local descriptors from a GeDi teacher. Our key contributions include: an efficient large-scale training procedure that ensures robustness to occlusions and partial observations while operating under compute and storage constraints, and a novel loss formulation that handles weak supervision from non-distinctive teacher descriptors. We validate our approach on five BOP Benchmark datasets and demonstrate a significant reduction in inference time while maintaining competitive performance with existing methods, bringing zero-shot 6D pose estimation closer to real-time feasibility.

However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

To this end, we present DnLUT, an ultra-efficient lookup table-based framework that achieves high-quality color image denoising with minimal resource consumption. Our key innovation lies in two complementary components: a Pairwise Channel Mixer (PCM) that effectively captures inter-channel correlations and spatial dependencies in parallel, and a novel L-shaped convolution design that maximizes receptive field coverage while minimizing storage overhead. By converting these components into optimized lookup tables post-training, DnLUT achieves remarkable efficiency - requiring only 500KB storage and 0.1% energy consumption compared to its CNN contestant DnCNN, while delivering 20X faster inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DnLUT outperforms all existing LUT-based methods by over 1dB in PSNR, establishing a new state-of-the-art in resource-efficient color image denoising.

However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

However, current state-of-the-art speculative decoding approaches have three key limitations: handling requests with varying difficulty using homogeneous SSMs, lack of robust support for batch processing, and insufficient holistic optimization for both speculation and verification phases. In this paper, we introduce SPIN, an efficient LLM inference serving system based on speculative decoding, designed to address these challenges through three main innovations. First, SPIN improves token speculation by using multiple heterogeneous SSMs, with a learning-based algorithm for SSM selection that operates without prior knowledge of request difficulty. Second, SPIN employs a request decomposition method to minimize batching overhead during LLM verification. Finally, SPIN orchestrates speculation and verification phases by pipelining their executions on GPUs to achieve further acceleration. Experimental results demonstrate that SPIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a performance increase of approximately 2.28X.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INFOCOM 2025</p></details> |

Concept bottleneck models offer an interpretable alternative by integrating human-understandable concepts into policies. However, prior work assumes that concept annotations are readily available during training. For RL, this requirement poses a significant limitation: it necessitates continuous real-time concept annotation, which either places an impractical burden on human annotators or incurs substantial costs in API queries and inference time when employing automated labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel training scheme that enables RL agents to efficiently learn a concept-based policy by only querying annotators to label a small set of data. Our algorithm, LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning and RL training, using an ensemble to actively select informative data points for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data. We show how LICORICE reduces human labeling efforts to 500 or fewer concept labels in three environments, and 5000 or fewer in two more complex environments, all at no cost to performance. We also explore the use of VLMs as automated concept annotators, finding them effective in some cases but imperfect in others. Our work significantly reduces the annotation burden for interpretable RL, making it more practical for real-world applications that necessitate transparency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

The challenge aims to generate semantically aligned sign language pose sequences from text inputs. To this end, we propose a Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) framework. During the training phase, TDM utilizes an encoder to encode text sequences and incorporates them into the diffusion model as conditional input to generate sign pose sequences. To guarantee the high quality and accuracy of the generated pose sequences, we utilize two key loss functions. The joint loss function L_{joint} is used to precisely measure and minimize the differences between the joint positions of the generated pose sequences and those of the ground truth. Similarly, the bone orientation loss function L_{bone} is instrumental in ensuring that the orientation of the bones in the generated poses aligns with the actual, correct orientations. In the inference stage, the TDM framework takes on a different yet equally important task. It starts with noisy sequences and, under the strict constraints of the text conditions, gradually refines and generates semantically consistent sign language pose sequences. Our carefully designed framework performs well on the sign language production task, and our solution achieves a BLEU-1 score of 20.17, placing second in the challenge.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

However, it is found to be susceptible to backdoor attacks merely via polluting a small portion of training data. The victim encoders associate triggered inputs with target embeddings, e.g., mapping a triggered cat image to an airplane embedding, such that the downstream tasks inherit unintended behaviors when the trigger is activated. Emerging backdoor attacks have shown great threats across different SSL paradigms such as contrastive learning and CLIP, yet limited research is devoted to defending against such attacks, and existing defenses fall short in detecting advanced stealthy backdoors. To address the limitations, we propose a novel detection mechanism, DeDe, which detects the activation of backdoor mappings caused by triggered inputs on victim encoders. Specifically, DeDe trains a decoder for any given SSL encoder using an auxiliary dataset (which can be out-of-distribution or even slightly poisoned), so that for any triggered input that misleads the encoder into the target embedding, the decoder generates an output image significantly different from the input. DeDe leverages the discrepancy between the input and the decoded output to identify potential backdoor misbehavior during inference. We empirically evaluate DeDe on both contrastive learning and CLIP models against various types of backdoor attacks. Our results demonstrate promising detection effectiveness over various advanced attacks and superior performance compared over state-of-the-art detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Current test-time adaptation methods are often memory-intensive and not designed to be quantization-compatible or deployed on low-resource devices. To address these challenges, we present LeanTTA, a novel backpropagation-free and stateless framework for quantized test-time adaptation tailored to edge devices. Our approach minimizes computational costs by dynamically updating normalization statistics without backpropagation, which frees LeanTTA from the common pitfall of relying on large batches and historical data, making our method robust to realistic deployment scenarios. Our approach is the first to enable further computational gains by combining partial adaptation with quantized module fusion. We validate our framework across sensor modalities, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art TTA methods, including a 15.7% error reduction, peak memory usage of only 11.2MB for ResNet18, and fast adaptation within an order-of-magnitude of normal inference speeds on-device. LeanTTA provides a robust solution for achieving the right trade offs between accuracy and system efficiency in edge deployments, addressing the unique challenges posed by limited data and varied operational conditions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Moreover, these methods perform unlearning at a coarse granularity, often leading to excessive forgetting and reduced model utility. To address this issue, we introduce SAUCE, a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for fine-grained and selective concept unlearning in VLMs. Briefly, SAUCE first trains SAEs to capture high-dimensional, semantically rich sparse features. It then identifies the features most relevant to the target concept for unlearning. During inference, it selectively modifies these features to suppress specific concepts while preserving unrelated information. We evaluate SAUCE on two distinct VLMs, LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, across two types of tasks: concrete concept unlearning (objects and sports scenes) and abstract concept unlearning (emotions, colors, and materials), encompassing a total of 60 concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAUCE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 18.04% in unlearning quality while maintaining comparable model utility. Furthermore, we investigate SAUCE's robustness against widely used adversarial attacks, its transferability across models, and its scalability in handling multiple simultaneous unlearning requests. Our findings establish SAUCE as an effective and scalable solution for selective concept unlearning in VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More comparative experiments are needed</p></details> |

To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded spatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary text prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model camera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from instability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the modality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and inference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video generation model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a dedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model via communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through separate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image modalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that denoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised poses to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and enhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world datasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms existing text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc refinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without such refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gohyojun15.github.io/VideoRFSplat/</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the performance of on-device LLMs is intrinsically constrained by resource limitations on edge devices. Sitting between cloud and on-device AI, mobile edge intelligence (MEI) presents a viable solution by provisioning AI capabilities at the edge of mobile networks, enabling end users to offload heavy AI computation to capable edge servers nearby.

Finally, we identify future research opportunities.

Some examples of such systems include social networks, financial transactions, supply chains, and molecular structures. In many of these cases, one needs to consider a collection of graphs, rather than a single network. This could be a collection of distinct but related graphs, such as different protein structures or graphs resulting from dynamic processes on the same network. Examples of the latter include the evolution of social networks, community-induced graphs, or ego-nets around various nodes. A significant challenge commonly encountered is the absence of ground-truth labels for graphs or nodes, necessitating the use of unsupervised techniques to analyze such systems. Moreover, even when ground-truth labels are available, many existing graph machine learning methods depend on complex deep learning models, complicating model explainability and interpretability. To address some of these challenges, we have introduced NEExT (Network Embedding Exploration Tool) for embedding collections of graphs via user-defined node features. The advantages of the framework are twofold: (i) the ability to easily define your own interpretable node-based features in view of the task at hand, and (ii) fast embedding of graphs provided by the Vectorizers library. In this paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of NEExT on collections of synthetic and real-world graphs. For supervised tasks, we demonstrate that performance in graph classification tasks could be achieved similarly to other state-of-the-art techniques while maintaining model interpretability. Furthermore, our framework can also be used to generate high-quality embeddings in an unsupervised way, where target variables are not available.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

| **[QVGen: Pushing the Limit of Quantized Video Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11497v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |
| **[SHIELD: Safety on Humanoids via CBFs In Expectation on Learned Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11494v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning has produced remarkably effective ``black-box'' controllers for complex tasks such as dynamic locomotion on humanoids. Yet ensuring dynamic safety, i.e., constraint satisfaction, remains challenging for such policies. Reinforcement learning (RL) embeds constraints heuristically through reward engineering, and adding or modifying constraints requires retraining. Model-based approaches, like control barrier functions (CBFs), enable runtime constraint specification with formal guarantees but require accurate dynamics models. This paper presents SHIELD, a layered safety framework that bridges this gap by: (1) training a generative, stochastic dynamics residual model using real-world data from hardware rollouts of the nominal controller, capturing system behavior and uncertainties; and (2) adding a safety layer on top of the nominal (learned locomotion) controller that leverages this model via a stochastic discrete-time CBF formulation enforcing safety constraints in probability. The result is a minimally-invasive safety layer that can be added to the existing autonomy stack to give probabilistic guarantees of safety that balance risk and performance. In hardware experiments on an Unitree G1 humanoid, SHIELD enables safe navigation (obstacle avoidance) through varied indoor and outdoor environments using a nominal (unknown) RL controller and onboard perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video at https://vimeo.com/1061676063</p></details> |

In this work, we analyze hidden states and modify them at inference, with a focus on motion forecasting. We use linear probing to analyze whether interpretable features are embedded in hidden states. Our experiments reveal high probing accuracy, indicating latent space regularities with functionally important directions. Building on this, we use the directions between hidden states with opposing features to fit control vectors. At inference, we add our control vectors to hidden states and evaluate their impact on predictions. Remarkably, such modifications preserve the feasibility of predictions. We further refine our control vectors using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). This leads to more linear changes in predictions when scaling control vectors. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretation as well as zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 final version.

| **[Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11441v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[MID-L: Matrix-Interpolated Dropout Layer with Layer-wise Neuron Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11416v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural networks often activate all neurons for every input, leading to unnecessary computation and inefficiency. We introduce Matrix-Interpolated Dropout Layer (MID-L), a novel module that dynamically selects and activates only the most informative neurons by interpolating between two transformation paths via a learned, input-dependent gating vector. Unlike conventional dropout or static sparsity methods, MID-L employs a differentiable Top-k masking strategy, enabling per-input adaptive computation while maintaining end-to-end differentiability. MID-L is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing architectures. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, UCI Adult, and IMDB, show that MID-L achieves up to average 55\% reduction in active neurons, 1.7$\times$ FLOPs savings, and maintains or exceeds baseline accuracy. We further validate the informativeness and selectivity of the learned neurons via Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) and observe improved robustness under overfitting and noisy data conditions. Additionally, MID-L demonstrates favorable inference latency and memory usage profiles, making it suitable for both research exploration and deployment on compute-constrained systems. These results position MID-L as a general-purpose, plug-and-play dynamic computation layer, bridging the gap between dropout regularization and efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in a Computer Science Conference, currently in Review</p></details> |
| **[TANTE: Time-Adaptive Operator Learning via Neural Taylor Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08574v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) has seen rapid progress in recent years, enabling efficient approximation of complex spatiotemporal dynamics. However, most existing methods rely on fixed time step sizes during rollout, which limits their ability to adapt to varying temporal complexity and often leads to error accumulation. To address this gap, we propose the Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion (TANTE), a novel operator-learning framework that produces continuous-time predictions with adaptive step sizes. TANTE predicts future states by performing a Taylor expansion at the current state, where neural networks learn both the higher-order temporal derivatives and the local radius of convergence. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its rollout based on the local behavior of the solution, thereby reducing cumulative error and improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TANTE across a wide range of PDE benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to fixed-step baselines, delivering accuracy gains of 10-50 % and speed-ups of 30-80 % at inference.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Drama: Mamba-Enabled Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Is Sample and Parameter Efficient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08893v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to the data inefficiency that plagues most model-free RL algorithms. However, learning a robust world model often requires complex and deep architectures, which are computationally expensive and challenging to train. Within the world model, sequence models play a critical role in accurate predictions, and various architectures have been explored, each with its own challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based world models struggle with vanishing gradients and capturing long-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, suffer from the quadratic memory and computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms, scaling as $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose a state space model (SSM)-based world model, Drama, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and enabling efficient training with longer sequences. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early training stages. Combining these techniques, Drama achieves a normalised score on the Atari100k benchmark that is competitive with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based RL algorithms, using only a 7 million-parameter world model. Drama is accessible and trainable on off-the-shelf hardware, such as a standard laptop. Our code is available at https://github.com/realwenlongwang/Drama.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Research has shown that code following the cryptographic constant-time discipline can be efficiently protected against Spectre v1 using a selective variant of Speculative Load Hardening (SLH). SLH was, however, not strong enough for protecting non-cryptographic code, leading to the introduction of Ultimate SLH, which provides protection for arbitrary programs, but has too large overhead for general use, since it conservatively assumes that all data is secret. In this paper we introduce a flexible SLH notion that achieves the best of both worlds by generalizing both Selective and Ultimate SLH. We give a suitable security definition for such transformations protecting arbitrary programs: any transformed program running with speculation should not leak more than what the source program leaks sequentially. We formally prove using the Rocq prover that two flexible SLH variants enforce this relative security guarantee. As easy corollaries we also obtain that, in our setting, Ultimate SLH enforces our relative security notion, and two selective SLH variants enforce speculative constant-time security.</p></details> | <details><summary>CSF'2...</summary><p>CSF'25 camera-ready version extended version with appendices</p></details> |
| **[Out-of-distribution generalisation is hard: evidence from ARC-like tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09716v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data, it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct features for compositional generalisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction: Pay Less Attention to Learn More](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07490v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.</p></details> | 17 pages,7 figures |
| **[What Can We Learn From MIMO Graph Convolutions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11346v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most graph neural networks (GNNs) utilize approximations of the general graph convolution derived in the graph Fourier domain. While GNNs are typically applied in the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) case, the approximations are performed in the single-input single-output (SISO) case. In this work, we first derive the MIMO graph convolution through the convolution theorem and approximate it directly in the MIMO case. We find the key MIMO-specific property of the graph convolution to be operating on multiple computational graphs, or equivalently, applying distinct feature transformations for each pair of nodes. As a localized approximation, we introduce localized MIMO graph convolutions (LMGCs), which generalize many linear message-passing neural networks. For almost every choice of edge weights, we prove that LMGCs with a single computational graph are injective on multisets, and the resulting representations are linearly independent when more than one computational graph is used. Our experimental results confirm that an LMGC can combine the benefits of various methods.</p></details> | IJCAI 2025 |
| **[Dynamic Base model Shift for Delta Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11344v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models with the pretrain-finetune paradigm bring about significant progress, along with the heavy storage and deployment costs of finetuned models on multiple tasks. Delta compression attempts to lower the costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights) through pruning or quantization. However, existing methods by default employ the pretrained model as the base model and compress the delta parameters for every task, which may causes significant performance degradation, especially when the compression rate is extremely high. To tackle this issue, we investigate the impact of different base models on the performance of delta compression and find that the pre-trained base model can hardly be optimal. To this end, we propose Dynamic Base Model Shift (DBMS), which dynamically adapts the base model to the target task before performing delta compression. Specifically, we adjust two parameters, which respectively determine the magnitude of the base model shift and the overall scale of delta compression, to boost the compression performance on each task. Through low-cost learning of these two parameters, our DBMS can maintain most of the finetuned model's performance even under an extremely high compression ratio setting, significantly surpassing existing methods. Moreover, our DBMS is orthogonal and can be integrated with a variety of other methods, and it has been evaluated across different types of models including language, vision transformer, and multi-modal models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ImprovNet -- Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with Iterative Corruption Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04522v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces.

| **[QuXAI: Explainers for Hybrid Quantum Machine Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10167v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

This representation supports efficiently navigational operations and complex binary operations, such as matrix-matrix multiplication, while maintaining space efficiency. The standard $k^2$-tree follows a level-by-level representation, which, while effective, prevents further compression of identical subtrees and it si not cache friendly when accessing individual subtrees. In this work, we introduce some novel depth-first representations of the $k^2$-tree and propose an efficient linear-time algorithm to identify and compress identical subtrees within these structures. Our experimental results show that the use of a depth-first representations is a strategy worth pursuing: for the adjacency matrix of web graphs exploiting the presence of identical subtrees does improve the compression ratio, and for some matrices depth-first representations turns out to be faster than the standard $k^2$-tree in computing the matrix-matrix multiplication.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended submission for SPIRE 2025</p></details> |

Models that compress videos by local aggregation in time or space have become popular for handling long-form inputs; however, these pooling-based projectors sacrifice the benefits of fixed-length representations that are crucial for streaming and efficient video understanding. We introduce $\texttt{Espresso}$, a new architecture that separately compresses spatial and temporal features into fixed-length sequences. $\texttt{Espresso}$ enables efficient video encoding while maintaining strong long-form reasoning capabilities. Experiments show that fixed-length compression combined with segment-wise processing offers a scalable and competitive alternative to pooling-based approaches. Our results demonstrate that fixed-length projectors, when properly designed and trained, remain a viable foundation for video-language modeling.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Temporal fine-tuning for early risk detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11280v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web aims to identify promptly users facing social and health issues. Users are analyzed post-by-post, and it is necessary to guarantee correct and quick answers, which is particularly challenging in critical scenarios. ERD involves optimizing classification precision and minimizing detection delay. Standard classification metrics may not suffice, resorting to specific metrics such as ERDE(theta) that explicitly consider precision and delay. The current research focuses on applying a multi-objective approach, prioritizing classification performance and establishing a separate criterion for decision time. In this work, we propose a completely different strategy, temporal fine-tuning, which allows tuning transformer-based models by explicitly incorporating time within the learning process. Our method allows us to analyze complete user post histories, tune models considering different contexts, and evaluate training performance using temporal metrics. We evaluated our proposal in the depression and eating disorders tasks for the Spanish language, achieving competitive results compared to the best models of MentalRiskES 2023. We found that temporal fine-tuning optimized decisions considering context and time progress. In this way, by properly taking advantage of the power of transformers, it is possible to address ERD by combining precision and speed as a single objective.</p></details> | <details><summary>In: P...</summary><p>In: Proceedings of the 53rd JAIIO / 50th CLEI - ASAID, 2024, p. 137.

| **[CONGO: Compressive Online Gradient Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06325v4)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of zeroth-order online convex optimization where the objective function's gradient exhibits sparsity, indicating that only a small number of dimensions possess non-zero gradients. Our aim is to leverage this sparsity to obtain useful estimates of the objective function's gradient even when the only information available is a limited number of function samples. Our motivation stems from the optimization of large-scale queueing networks that process time-sensitive jobs. Here, a job must be processed by potentially many queues in sequence to produce an output, and the service time at any queue is a function of the resources allocated to that queue. Since resources are costly, the end-to-end latency for jobs must be balanced with the overall cost of the resources used. While the number of queues is substantial, the latency function primarily reacts to resource changes in only a few, rendering the gradient sparse. We tackle this problem by introducing the Compressive Online Gradient Optimization framework which allows compressive sensing methods previously applied to stochastic optimization to achieve regret bounds with an optimal dependence on the time horizon without the full problem dimension appearing in the bound. For specific algorithms, we reduce the samples required per gradient estimate to scale with the gradient's sparsity factor rather than its full dimensionality. Numerical simulations and real-world microservices benchmarks demonstrate CONGO's superiority over gradient descent approaches that do not account for sparsity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025; 34 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

This review presents a comprehensive analysis of discriminative SSL methods, which focus on learning representations by solving pretext tasks that do not require human labels. The paper systematically categorizes discriminative SSL approaches into five main groups: contrastive methods, clustering methods, self-distillation methods, knowledge distillation methods, and feature decorrelation methods. For each category, the review details the underlying principles, architectural components, loss functions, and representative algorithms, highlighting their unique mechanisms and contributions to the field. Extensive comparative evaluations are provided, including linear and semi-supervised protocols on standard benchmarks such as ImageNet, as well as transfer learning performance across diverse downstream tasks. The review also discusses theoretical foundations, scalability, efficiency, and practical challenges, such as computational demands and accessibility. By synthesizing recent advancements and identifying key trends, open challenges, and future research directions, this work serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to leverage discriminative SSL for robust and generalizable computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 97 pages, 12 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing False-Positive Attributions in Explanations of Non-Linear Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11210v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suppressor variables can influence model predictions without being dependent on the target outcome and they pose a significant challenge for Explainable AI (XAI) methods. These variables may cause false-positive feature attributions, undermining the utility of explanations. Although effective remedies exist for linear models, their extension to non-linear models and to instance-based explanations has remained limited. We introduce PatternLocal, a novel XAI technique that addresses this gap. PatternLocal begins with a locally linear surrogate, e.g. LIME, KernelSHAP, or gradient-based methods, and transforms the resulting discriminative model weights into a generative representation, thereby suppressing the influence of suppressor variables while preserving local fidelity. In extensive hyperparameter optimization on the XAI-TRIS benchmark, PatternLocal consistently outperformed other XAI methods and reduced false-positive attributions when explaining non-linear tasks, thereby enabling more reliable and actionable insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[RanDeS: Randomized Delta Superposition for Multi-Model Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11204v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From a multi-model compression perspective, model merging enables memory-efficient serving of multiple models fine-tuned from the same base, but suffers from degraded performance due to interference among their task-specific parameter adjustments (i.e., deltas). In this paper, we reformulate model merging as a compress-and-retrieve scheme, revealing that the task interference arises from the summation of irrelevant deltas during model retrieval. To address this issue, we use random orthogonal transformations to decorrelate these vectors into self-cancellation. We show that this approach drastically reduces interference, improving performance across both vision and language tasks. Since these transformations are fully defined by random seeds, adding new models requires no extra memory. Further, their data- and model-agnostic nature enables easy addition or removal of models with minimal compute overhead, supporting efficient and flexible multi-model serving.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Zhou-Hangyu/randes</p></details> |
| **[DiCo: Revitalizing ConvNets for Scalable and Efficient Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11196v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a promising diffusion model for visual generation, demonstrates impressive performance but incurs significant computational overhead. Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, DiCo outperforms previous diffusion models in both image quality and generation speed. Notably, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53 at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively. Furthermore, our largest model, DiCo-H, scaled to 1B parameters, reaches an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256x256-without any additional supervision during training.

| **[Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07972v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Representation Learning, 2025</p></details> |

Most current methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which focus on local features while neglecting global features. Recently, self-attention mechanisms have been introduced into the field of computer vision, demonstrating superior performance. Therefore, this paper proposes an effective model, CheX-DS, for classifying long-tail multi-label data in the medical field of chest X-rays. The model is based on the excellent CNN model DenseNet for medical imaging and the newly popular Swin Transformer model, utilizing ensemble deep learning techniques to combine the two models and leverage the advantages of both CNNs and Transformers. The loss function of CheX-DS combines weighted binary cross-entropy loss with asymmetric loss, effectively addressing the issue of data imbalance. The NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset is selected to evaluate the model's effectiveness. The model outperforms previous studies with an excellent average AUC score of 83.76\%, demonstrating its superior performance.</p></details> | BIBM |

While the recent asynchronous-to-synchronous (A2S) paradigm aims to bridge this gap by asynchronously encoding events into learned representations for ML pipelines, existing A2S approaches often sacrifice representation expressivity and generalizability compared to dense, synchronous methods. This paper introduces EVA (EVent Asynchronous representation learning), a novel A2S framework to generate highly expressive and generalizable event-by-event representations. Inspired by the analogy between events and language, EVA uniquely adapts advances from language modeling in linear attention and self-supervised learning for its construction. In demonstration, EVA outperforms prior A2S methods on recognition tasks (DVS128-Gesture and N-Cars), and represents the first A2S framework to successfully master demanding detection tasks, achieving a remarkable 47.7 mAP on the Gen1 dataset. These results underscore EVA's transformative potential for advancing real-time event-based vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, the lack of standardized implementations, evaluation pipelines, and consistent design choices has hindered fair comparison and principled analysis. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{STEP}, a unified benchmark framework for Spiking Transformers that supports a wide range of tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection across static, event-based, and sequential datasets. STEP provides modular support for diverse components such as spiking neurons, input encodings, surrogate gradients, and multiple backends (e.g., SpikingJelly, BrainCog). Using STEP, we reproduce and evaluate several representative models, and conduct systematic ablation studies on attention design, neuron types, encoding schemes, and temporal modeling capabilities. We also propose a unified analytical model for energy estimation, accounting for spike sparsity, bitwidth, and memory access, and show that quantized ANNs may offer comparable or better energy efficiency. Our results suggest that current Spiking Transformers rely heavily on convolutional frontends and lack strong temporal modeling, underscoring the need for spike-native architectural innovations.

Recently, a brain-inspired SSL model named PhiNet was proposed; it is based on a ResNet backbone and operates on static image inputs with strong augmentation. In this paper, we introduce PhiNet v2, a novel Transformer-based architecture that processes temporal visual input (that is, sequences of images) without relying on strong augmentation. Our model leverages variational inference to learn robust visual representations from continuous input streams, similar to human visual processing. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PhiNet v2 achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision foundation models, while maintaining the ability to learn from sequential input without strong data augmentation. This work represents a significant step toward more biologically plausible computer vision systems that process visual information in a manner more closely aligned with human cognitive processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.14650</p></details> |

However, challenges such as high computational and memory demands, heterogeneous client resources, bandwidth constraints, and ineffective global aggregation hinder its efficiency. To address these issues, we propose HAFLQ (Heterogeneous Adaptive Federated Low-Rank Adaptation Fine-tuned LLM with Quantization), a novel framework for efficient and scalable federated fine-tuning of LLMs in heterogeneous environments. To reduce memory and computation demands, we propose a salience-driven adaptive LLM quantization framework that evaluates the importance of transformer blocks using a salience metric and applies adaptive block-wise quantization accordingly. To handle heterogeneous computational capabilities, we propose an importance-based parameter truncation and freezing scheme. To address communication bottlenecks, we propose an importance-aware bandwidth-adaptive quantization method, which dynamically adjusts parameter precision based on importance and bandwidth constraints. To improve global model aggregation, we propose an adaptive rank-1 matrix-level aggregation strategy, which prevents information dilution and accelerates convergence by aggregating only updated rank-1 matrices from clients. Experimental results on the text classification task demonstrate that HAFLQ reduces memory usage by 31%, lowers communication cost by 49%, improves accuracy by 50%, and achieves faster convergence compared to the baseline method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended journal version based on our previous conference paper accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), with additional sections and new results</p></details> |

Within such systems, repetitive transformations can lead to stable configurations, known as attractors, including fixed points and limit cycles. Applying this perspective to large language models (LLMs), which iteratively map input text to output text, provides a principled approach to characterizing long-term behaviors. Successive paraphrasing serves as a compelling testbed for exploring such dynamics, as paraphrases re-express the same underlying meaning with linguistic variation. Although LLMs are expected to explore a diverse set of paraphrases in the text space, our study reveals that successive paraphrasing converges to stable periodic states, such as 2-period attractor cycles, limiting linguistic diversity. This phenomenon is attributed to the self-reinforcing nature of LLMs, as they iteratively favour and amplify certain textual forms over others. This pattern persists with increasing generation randomness or alternating prompts and LLMs. These findings underscore inherent constraints in LLM generative capability, while offering a novel dynamical systems perspective for studying their expressive potential.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVAS, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVAS incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVAS achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVAS-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVAS-100, AVAS achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, AVAS, add latency breakdown</p></details> |

However, recent progress in this area is saturating, underscoring the need to revisit its core limitations and explore further improvements. We address this challenge by identifying a key limitation of existing layer-wise PTQ methods: the growth of quantization errors across layers significantly degrades performance, particularly in low-bit regimes. To address this fundamental issue, we propose Quantization Error Propagation (QEP), a general, lightweight, and scalable framework that enhances layer-wise PTQ by explicitly propagating quantization errors and compensating for accumulated errors. QEP also offers a tunable propagation mechanism that prevents overfitting and controls computational overhead, enabling the framework to adapt to various architectures and resource budgets. Extensive experiments on several LLMs demonstrate that QEP-enhanced layer-wise PTQ achieves substantially higher accuracy than existing methods. Notably, the gains are most pronounced in the extremely low-bit quantization regime.</p></details> | 28 pages, 3 figures |

We investigate the reconstruction of complete syllable sequences from various incomplete input types, including consonant sequences, vowel sequences, partial syllables (with random character deletions), and masked syllables (with fixed syllable deletions). Our experiments reveal that consonant sequences play a critical role in accurate syllable prediction, achieving high BLEU scores, while vowel sequences present a significantly greater challenge. The model demonstrates robust performance across tasks, particularly in handling partial and masked syllable reconstruction, with strong results for tasks involving consonant information and syllable masking. This study advances the understanding of sequence prediction for Abugida languages and provides practical insights for applications such as text prediction, spelling correction, and data augmentation in these scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables, 1 listing</p></details> |
| **[ForensicHub: A Unified Benchmark & Codebase for All-Domain Fake Image Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11003v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset, model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6 backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii) conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. We further simplify the TTS pipeline by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we introduce context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational overhead compared to contemporary TTS models.

| **[Relational Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10960v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational Deep Learning (RDL) is a promising approach for building state-of-the-art predictive models on multi-table relational data by representing it as a heterogeneous temporal graph. However, commonly used Graph Neural Network models suffer from fundamental limitations in capturing complex structural patterns and long-range dependencies that are inherent in relational data. While Graph Transformers have emerged as powerful alternatives to GNNs on general graphs, applying them to relational entity graphs presents unique challenges: (i) Traditional positional encodings fail to generalize to massive, heterogeneous graphs; (ii) existing architectures cannot model the temporal dynamics and schema constraints of relational data; (iii) existing tokenization schemes lose critical structural information. Here we introduce the Relational Graph Transformer (RelGT), the first graph transformer architecture designed specifically for relational tables. RelGT employs a novel multi-element tokenization strategy that decomposes each node into five components (features, type, hop distance, time, and local structure), enabling efficient encoding of heterogeneity, temporality, and topology without expensive precomputation. Our architecture combines local attention over sampled subgraphs with global attention to learnable centroids, incorporating both local and database-wide representations. Across 21 tasks from the RelBench benchmark, RelGT consistently matches or outperforms GNN baselines by up to 18%, establishing Graph Transformers as a powerful architecture for Relational Deep Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/snap-stanford/relgt</p></details> |

By using the so-called tent transform and its mapping properties we inherit error bounds from the periodic setting. Our analysis is based on decay properties of the multivariate Faber-Schauder coefficients of functions with bounded mixed second weak derivatives. As already observed by Hinrichs, Markhasin, Oettershagen, T. Ullrich (Numerische Mathematik 2016), order $2$ nets work particularly well on tensorized (periodic) Faber splines. From this we obtain a quadratic decay rate for tent transformed order $2$ nets also in the nonperiodic setting. This improves the formerly best known bound for this class of point sets by a factor of $\log N$. We back up our findings with numerical experiments, even suggesting that the bounds for order $2$ nets can be improved even further. This particularly indicates that point sets of lower complexity (compared to previously considered constructions) may already give (near) optimal error decay rates for quadrature of functions with second order mixed smoothness.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.06118</p></details> |

Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released upon acceptance</p></details> |

While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode informative thinking without the information loss associated with autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency. Source code is available at https://github.com/xuyige/SoftCoT.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, diffusion models often suffer from slow inference due to costly denoising processes or require complex sequential training arising from recent distilling approaches. This paper introduces Riemannian Flow Matching Policy (RFMP), a model that inherits the easy training and fast inference capabilities of flow matching (FM). Moreover, RFMP inherently incorporates geometric constraints commonly found in realistic robotic applications, as the robot state resides on a Riemannian manifold. To enhance the robustness of RFMP, we propose Stable RFMP (SRFMP), which leverages LaSalle's invariance principle to equip the dynamics of FM with stability to the support of a target Riemannian distribution. Rigorous evaluation on eight simulated and real-world tasks show that RFMP successfully learns and synthesizes complex sensorimotor policies on Euclidean and Riemannian spaces with efficient training and inference phases, outperforming Diffusion Policies and Consistency Policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures, 12 tables, project website: https://sites.google.com/view/rfmp</p></details> |

In this work, we analyze hidden states and modify them at inference, with a focus on motion forecasting. We use linear probing to analyze whether interpretable features are embedded in hidden states. Our experiments reveal high probing accuracy, indicating latent space regularities with functionally important directions. Building on this, we use the directions between hidden states with opposing features to fit control vectors. At inference, we add our control vectors to hidden states and evaluate their impact on predictions. Remarkably, such modifications preserve the feasibility of predictions. We further refine our control vectors using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). This leads to more linear changes in predictions when scaling control vectors. Our approach enables mechanistic interpretation as well as zero-shot generalization to unseen dataset characteristics with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 final version.

Magnetic tactile skins offer a flexible form factor for hand-wide coverage with fast response times, in contrast to vision-based tactile sensors that are restricted to the fingertips and limited by bandwidth. Full hand tactile perception is crucial for robot dexterity. However, a lack of general-purpose models, challenges with interpreting magnetic flux and calibration have limited the adoption of these sensors. Sparsh-skin, given a history of kinematic and tactile sensing across a hand, outputs a latent tactile embedding that can be used in any downstream task. The encoder is self-supervised via self-distillation on a variety of unlabeled hand-object interactions using an Allegro hand sensorized with Xela uSkin. In experiments across several benchmark tasks, from state estimation to policy learning, we find that pretrained Sparsh-skin representations are both sample efficient in learning downstream tasks and improve task performance by over 41% compared to prior work and over 56% compared to end-to-end learning.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

We introduce Matrix-Interpolated Dropout Layer (MID-L), a novel module that dynamically selects and activates only the most informative neurons by interpolating between two transformation paths via a learned, input-dependent gating vector. Unlike conventional dropout or static sparsity methods, MID-L employs a differentiable Top-k masking strategy, enabling per-input adaptive computation while maintaining end-to-end differentiability. MID-L is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing architectures. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, UCI Adult, and IMDB, show that MID-L achieves up to average 55\% reduction in active neurons, 1.7$\times$ FLOPs savings, and maintains or exceeds baseline accuracy. We further validate the informativeness and selectivity of the learned neurons via Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) and observe improved robustness under overfitting and noisy data conditions. Additionally, MID-L demonstrates favorable inference latency and memory usage profiles, making it suitable for both research exploration and deployment on compute-constrained systems. These results position MID-L as a general-purpose, plug-and-play dynamic computation layer, bridging the gap between dropout regularization and efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in a Computer Science Conference, currently in Review</p></details> |

However, most existing methods rely on fixed time step sizes during rollout, which limits their ability to adapt to varying temporal complexity and often leads to error accumulation. To address this gap, we propose the Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion (TANTE), a novel operator-learning framework that produces continuous-time predictions with adaptive step sizes. TANTE predicts future states by performing a Taylor expansion at the current state, where neural networks learn both the higher-order temporal derivatives and the local radius of convergence. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its rollout based on the local behavior of the solution, thereby reducing cumulative error and improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TANTE across a wide range of PDE benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to fixed-step baselines, delivering accuracy gains of 10-50 % and speed-ups of 30-80 % at inference.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Visual Planning: Let's Think Only with Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11409v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have substantially enhanced machine reasoning across diverse tasks. However, these models predominantly rely on pure text as the medium for both expressing and structuring reasoning, even when visual information is present. In this work, we argue that language may not always be the most natural or effective modality for reasoning, particularly in tasks involving spatial and geometrical information. Motivated by this, we propose a new paradigm, Visual Planning, which enables planning through purely visual representations, independent of text. In this paradigm, planning is executed via sequences of images that encode step-by-step inference in the visual domain, akin to how humans sketch or visualize future actions. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework, Visual Planning via Reinforcement Learning (VPRL), empowered by GRPO for post-training large vision models, leading to substantial improvements in planning in a selection of representative visual navigation tasks, FrozenLake, Maze, and MiniBehavior. Our visual planning paradigm outperforms all other planning variants that conduct reasoning in the text-only space. Our results establish Visual Planning as a viable and promising alternative to language-based reasoning, opening new avenues for tasks that benefit from intuitive, image-based inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table (26 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

But what about toxicity detection in speech? To investigate the extent to which text-based biases are mitigated by speech-based systems, we produce a set of high-quality group annotations for the multilingual MuTox dataset, and then leverage these annotations to systematically compare speech- and text-based toxicity classifiers. Our findings indicate that access to speech data during inference supports reduced bias against group mentions, particularly for ambiguous and disagreement-inducing samples. Our results also suggest that improving classifiers, rather than transcription pipelines, is more helpful for reducing group bias. We publicly release our annotations and provide recommendations for future toxicity dataset construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Analog Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09663v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions, off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach enables state-of-the-art models $\unicode{x2013}$ including Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\unicode{x2013}$ to retain performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models.

To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.</p></details> | 17 pages,7 figures |
| **[Sobolev Training of End-to-End Optimization Proxies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11342v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization proxies - machine learning models trained to approximate the solution mapping of parametric optimization problems in a single forward pass - offer dramatic reductions in inference time compared to traditional iterative solvers. This work investigates the integration of solver sensitivities into such end to end proxies via a Sobolev training paradigm and does so in two distinct settings: (i) fully supervised proxies, where exact solver outputs and sensitivities are available, and (ii) self supervised proxies that rely only on the objective and constraint structure of the underlying optimization problem. By augmenting the standard training loss with directional derivative information extracted from the solver, the proxy aligns both its predicted solutions and local derivatives with those of the optimizer. Under Lipschitz continuity assumptions on the true solution mapping, matching first order sensitivities is shown to yield uniform approximation error proportional to the training set covering radius. Empirically, different impacts are observed in each studied setting. On three large Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow benchmarks, supervised Sobolev training cuts mean squared error by up to 56 percent and the median worst case constraint violation by up to 400 percent while keeping the optimality gap below 0.22 percent. For a mean variance portfolio task trained without labeled solutions, self supervised Sobolev training halves the average optimality gap in the medium risk region (standard deviation above 10 percent of budget) and matches the baseline elsewhere. Together, these results highlight Sobolev training whether supervised or self supervised as a path to fast reliable surrogates for safety critical large scale optimization workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 4 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads. Further, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead. We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The computation of one subset is then overlapped with the communication of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce-RMSNorm kernel carefully leveraging Multimem instruction support available on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains. Our evaluations demonstrate up to 29% latency gains and up to 26% throughput gains across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

It optimises the effect parameters to minimise the distance between the style embeddings of the processed audio and the reference. However, this method treats all possible configurations equally and relies solely on the embedding space, which can lead to unrealistic or biased results. We address this pitfall by introducing a Gaussian prior derived from a vocal preset dataset, DiffVox, over the parameter space. The resulting optimisation is equivalent to maximum-a-posteriori estimation. Evaluations on vocal effects transfer on the MedleyDB dataset show significant improvements across metrics compared to baselines, including a blind audio effects estimator, nearest-neighbour approaches, and uncalibrated ST-ITO. The proposed calibration reduces parameter mean squared error by up to 33% and matches the reference style better. Subjective evaluations with 16 participants confirm our method's superiority, especially in limited data regimes. This work demonstrates how incorporating prior knowledge in inference time enhances audio effects transfer, paving the way for more effective and realistic audio processing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WASPAA 2025</p></details> |

Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

However, ML models often do not perform homogeneously across such populations resulting in subgroups of the population (e.g., sex=female AND marital_status=married) where the model underperforms or, conversely, is particularly accurate. Identifying and describing such subgroups can support practical decisions on which subpopulation a model is safe to deploy or where more training data is required. The potential of identifying and analyzing such subgroups has been recognized, however, an efficient and coherent framework for effective search is missing. Consequently, we introduce SubROC, an open-source, easy-to-use framework based on Exceptional Model Mining for reliably and efficiently finding strengths and weaknesses of classification models in the form of interpretable population subgroups. SubROC incorporates common evaluation measures (ROC and PR AUC), efficient search space pruning for fast exhaustive subgroup search, control for class imbalance, adjustment for redundant patterns, and significance testing. We illustrate the practical benefits of SubROC in case studies as well as in comparative analyses across multiple datasets.</p></details> | 49 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Set-Sequence Model for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11243v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many financial prediction problems, the behavior of individual units (such as loans, bonds, or stocks) is influenced by observable unit-level factors and macroeconomic variables, as well as by latent cross-sectional effects. Traditional approaches attempt to capture these latent effects via handcrafted summary features. We propose a Set-Sequence model that eliminates the need for handcrafted features. The Set model first learns a shared cross-sectional summary at each period. The Sequence model then ingests the summary-augmented time series for each unit independently to predict its outcome. Both components are learned jointly over arbitrary sets sampled during training. Our approach harnesses the set nature of the cross-section and is computationally efficient, generating set summaries in linear time relative to the number of units. It is also flexible, allowing the use of existing sequence models and accommodating a variable number of units at inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our Set-Sequence model significantly outperforms benchmarks on stock return prediction and mortgage behavior tasks.

Our findings reveal that these difficulties arise due to two inherent constraints on the self-attention mechanism, i.e., over-deduplication for object queries and self-centric attention for track queries. In contrast, removing the self-attention mechanism not only minimally impacts regression predictions of the tracker, but also tends to generate more latent candidate boxes. Based on these analyses, we present SynCL, a novel plug-and-play synergistic training strategy designed to co-facilitate multi-task learning for detection and tracking. Specifically, we propose a Task-specific Hybrid Matching module for a weight-shared cross-attention-based decoder that matches the targets of track queries with multiple object queries to exploit promising candidates overlooked by the self-attention mechanism. To flexibly select optimal candidates for the one-to-many matching, we also design a Dynamic Query Filtering module controlled by model training status. Moreover, we introduce Instance-aware Contrastive Learning to break through the barrier of self-centric attention for track queries, effectively bridging the gap between detection and tracking. Without additional inference costs, SynCL consistently delivers improvements in various benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance with $58.9\%$ AMOTA on the nuScenes dataset. Code and raw results will be publicly available.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies, and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles, context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool. The white-box ATT-Corpus and Auto-ATT can be found in ATT Hugging Face Collection (https://huggingface.co/collections/meituan/audio-turing-test-682446320368164faeaf38a4).</p></details> | Under Review |

Highly dynamic tasks such as Air Hockey additionally require agile behavior, making the corresponding optimal control problems intractable for planning in realtime. Learning-based approaches address this issue by shifting computationally expensive reasoning through contacts to an offline learning phase. However, learning low-level motor policies subject to kinematic and dynamic constraints can be challenging if operating in proximity to such constraints is desired. This paper explores the combination of distilling a stochastic optimal control policy for high-level contact planning and online model-predictive control for low-level constrained motion planning. Our system learns to balance shooting accuracy and resulting puck speed by leveraging bank shots and the robot's kinematic structure. We show that the proposed framework outperforms purely control-based and purely learning-based techniques in both simulated and real-world games of Robot Air Hockey.</p></details> | <details><summary>Robot...</summary><p>Robotics: Science and Systems 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce PhiNet v2, a novel Transformer-based architecture that processes temporal visual input (that is, sequences of images) without relying on strong augmentation. Our model leverages variational inference to learn robust visual representations from continuous input streams, similar to human visual processing. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PhiNet v2 achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision foundation models, while maintaining the ability to learn from sequential input without strong data augmentation. This work represents a significant step toward more biologically plausible computer vision systems that process visual information in a manner more closely aligned with human cognitive processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.14650</p></details> |

VLM pretraining aims to learn image and language alignments from a large number of image-text pairs. Each pretraining image is often associated with multiple captions containing redundant information due to repeated or semantically similar phrases, resulting in increased pretraining and inference time. To overcome this, we introduce a weighted feature aggregation (WFA) strategy for VLM pretraining in RS. Our strategy aims to extract and exploit complementary information from multiple captions per image while reducing redundancies through feature aggregation with importance weighting. To calculate adaptive importance weights for different captions of each image, we propose two techniques: (i) non-parametric uniqueness and (ii) learning-based attention. In the first technique, importance weights are calculated based on the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) scores of the captions to emphasize unique sentences and reduce the influence of repetitive ones. In the second technique, importance weights are learned through an attention mechanism instead of relying on hand-crafted features. The effectiveness of the proposed WFA strategy with the two techniques is analyzed in terms of downstream performance on text-to-image retrieval in RS. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy enables efficient and effective pretraining of VLMs in RS. Based on the experimental analysis, we derive guidelines for selecting appropriate techniques depending on downstream task requirements and resource constraints.

Considering one pattern occurring in one time series, we might be wondering whether the same pattern occurs in another time series with some distortion that might have a different length. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient framework that deals with this problem yet. In this work, we propose an algorithm that provides the exact solution of finding the most similar multidimensional subsequences between time series where there is a difference in length both between time series and between subsequences. The algorithm is built based on theoretical guarantee of correctness and efficiency. The result in simulation datasets illustrated that our approach not just only provided correct solution, but it also utilized running time only quarter of time compared against the baseline approaches. In real-world datasets, it extracted the most similar subsequences even faster (up to 20 times faster against baseline methods) and provided insights regarding the situation in stock market and following relations of multidimensional time series of baboon movement. Our approach can be used for any time series. The code and datasets of this work are provided for the public use.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite its flexibility and statistical reliability, cubic computational complexity limits its application to large datasets. To address this computational bottleneck, we propose \textit{FastKCI}, a scalable and parallelizable kernel-based conditional independence test that utilizes a mixture-of-experts approach inspired by embarrassingly parallel inference techniques for Gaussian processes. By partitioning the dataset based on a Gaussian mixture model over the conditioning variables, FastKCI conducts local KCI tests in parallel, aggregating the results using an importance-weighted sampling scheme. Experiments on synthetic datasets and benchmarks on real-world production data validate that FastKCI maintains the statistical power of the original KCI test while achieving substantial computational speedups. FastKCI thus represents a practical and efficient solution for conditional independence testing in causal inference on large-scale data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Among the primary variants of FL, vertical federated learning (VFL) addresses feature-partitioned data held by multiple institutions, each holding complementary information for the same set of users. However, existing VFL methods often impose restrictive assumptions such as a small number of participating parties, fully aligned data, or only using labeled data. In this work, we reinterpret alignment gaps in VFL as missing data problems and propose a unified framework that accommodates both training and inference under arbitrary alignment and labeling scenarios, while supporting diverse missingness mechanisms. In the experiments on 168 configurations spanning four benchmark datasets, six training-time missingness patterns, and seven testing-time missingness patterns, our method outperforms all baselines in 160 cases with an average gap of 9.6 percentage points over the next-best competitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first VFL framework to jointly handle arbitrary data alignment, unlabeled data, and multi-party collaboration all at once.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + appendix, 8 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods rarely consider safety requirements crucial in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose Safe Diffusion Models for PDE Control (SafeDiffCon), which introduce the uncertainty quantile as model uncertainty quantification to achieve optimal control under safety constraints through both post-training and inference phases. Firstly, our approach post-trains a pre-trained diffusion model to generate control sequences that better satisfy safety constraints while achieving improved control objectives via a reweighted diffusion loss, which incorporates the uncertainty quantile estimated using conformal prediction. Secondly, during inference, the diffusion model dynamically adjusts both its generation process and parameters through iterative guidance and fine-tuning, conditioned on control targets while simultaneously integrating the estimated uncertainty quantile. We evaluate SafeDiffCon on three control tasks: 1D Burgers' equation, 2D incompressible fluid, and controlled nuclear fusion problem. Results demonstrate that SafeDiffCon is the only method that satisfies all safety constraints, whereas other classical and deep learning baselines fail. Furthermore, while adhering to safety constraints, SafeDiffCon achieves the best control performance.

However, optimizing process parameters to balance product quality and profitability under dynamic environmental and economic conditions remains a persistent challenge. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework for real-time process optimization in injection molding, integrating product quality and profitability into the control objective. A profit function was developed to reflect real-world manufacturing costs, incorporating resin, mold wear, and electricity prices, including time-of-use variations. Surrogate models were constructed to predict product quality and cycle time, enabling efficient offline training of DRL agents using soft actor-critic (SAC) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DRL framework can dynamically adapt to seasonal and operational variations, consistently maintaining product quality while maximizing profit. Compared to traditional optimization methods such as genetic algorithms, the DRL models achieved comparable economic performance with up to 135x faster inference speeds, making them well-suited for real-time applications. The framework's scalability and adaptability highlight its potential as a foundation for intelligent, data-driven decision-making in modern manufacturing environments.</p></details> | 50 pages, 10 figures |

However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a method according to probability theory to quickly and accurately predict the scaling performance and select the best strategy under large sampling times without extra resource-intensive inference in practice. It can serve as the test-time scaling law for majority voting. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Accurate KV Cache Quantization with Outlier Tokens Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10938v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) come at the cost of substantial computational resources during deployment. While KV Cache can significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy. Previous research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern, which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. To address this, we develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization as outlier tokens, significantly improving overall accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements under 2-bit quantization and can deliver a 6.4 times reduction in memory usage and a 2.3 times increase in throughput.</p></details> | ACL2025 Main |
| **[FALCON: Fast Autonomous Aerial Exploration using Coverage Path Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00577v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces FALCON, a novel Fast Autonomous expLoration framework using COverage path guidaNce, which aims at setting a new performance benchmark in the field of autonomous aerial exploration. Despite recent advancements in the domain, existing exploration planners often suffer from inefficiencies such as frequent revisitations of previously explored regions.FALCON effectively harnesses the full potential of online generated coverage paths in enhancing exploration efficiency.The framework begins with an incremental connectivity-aware space decomposition and connectivity graph construction, which facilitate efficient coverage path planning.Subsequently, a hierarchical planner generates a coverage path spanning the entire unexplored space, serving as a global guidance.Then, a local planner optimizes the frontier visitation order, minimizing traversal time while consciously incorporating the intention of the global guidance.Finally, minimum-time smooth and safe trajectories are produced to visit the frontier viewpoints.For fair and comprehensive benchmark experiments, we introduce a lightweight exploration planner evaluation environment that allows for comparing exploration planners across a variety of testing scenarios using an identical quadrotor simulator.Additionally, an in-depth analysis and evaluation is conducted to highlight the significant performance advantages of FALCON in comparison with the state-of-the-art exploration planners based on objective criteria.Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed framework.Real-world experiments conducted fully onboard further validate FALCON's practical capability in complex and challenging environments.The source code of both the exploration planner FALCON and the exploration planner evaluation environment has been released to benefit the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE T-RO.

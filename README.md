| **[Learning to Track Any Points from Human Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06233v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion, with its inherent complexities, such as non-rigid deformations, articulated movements, clothing distortions, and frequent occlusions caused by limbs or other individuals, provides a rich and challenging source of supervision that is crucial for training robust and generalizable point trackers. Despite the suitability of human motion, acquiring extensive training data for point tracking remains difficult due to laborious manual annotation. Our proposed pipeline, AnthroTAP, addresses this by proposing an automated pipeline to generate pseudo-labeled training data, leveraging the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model. We first fit the SMPL model to detected humans in video frames, project the resulting 3D mesh vertices onto 2D image planes to generate pseudo-trajectories, handle occlusions using ray-casting, and filter out unreliable tracks based on optical flow consistency. A point tracking model trained on AnthroTAP annotated dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TAP-Vid benchmark, surpassing other models trained on real videos while using 10,000 times less data and only 1 day in 4 GPUs, compared to 256 GPUs used in recent state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/AnthroTAP/</p></details> |
| **[Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06223v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Is Diversity All You Need for Scalable Robotic Manipulation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06219v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scaling has driven remarkable success in foundation models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), yet the principles of effective data scaling in robotic manipulation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we investigate the nuanced role of data diversity in robot learning by examining three critical dimensions-task (what to do), embodiment (which robot to use), and expert (who demonstrates)-challenging the conventional intuition of "more diverse is better". Throughout extensive experiments on various robot platforms, we reveal that (1) task diversity proves more critical than per-task demonstration quantity, benefiting transfer from diverse pre-training tasks to novel downstream scenarios; (2) multi-embodiment pre-training data is optional for cross-embodiment transfer-models trained on high-quality single-embodiment data can efficiently transfer to different platforms, showing more desirable scaling property during fine-tuning than multi-embodiment pre-trained models; and (3) expert diversity, arising from individual operational preferences and stochastic variations in human demonstrations, can be confounding to policy learning, with velocity multimodality emerging as a key contributing factor. Based on this insight, we propose a distribution debiasing method to mitigate velocity ambiguity, the yielding GO-1-Pro achieves substantial performance gains of 15%, equivalent to using 2.5 times pre-training data. Collectively, these findings provide new perspectives and offer practical guidance on how to scale robotic manipulation datasets effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/AgiBot-World</p></details> |
| **[Embedding Atlas: Low-Friction, Interactive Embedding Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06386v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding projections are popular for visualizing large datasets and models. However, people often encounter "friction" when using embedding visualization tools: (1) barriers to adoption, e.g., tedious data wrangling and loading, scalability limits, no integration of results into existing workflows, and (2) limitations in possible analyses, without integration with external tools to additionally show coordinated views of metadata. In this paper, we present Embedding Atlas, a scalable, interactive visualization tool designed to make interacting with large embeddings as easy as possible. Embedding Atlas uses modern web technologies and advanced algorithms -- including density-based clustering, and automated labeling -- to provide a fast and rich data analysis experience at scale. We evaluate Embedding Atlas with a competitive analysis against other popular embedding tools, showing that Embedding Atlas's feature set specifically helps reduce friction, and report a benchmark on its real-time rendering performance with millions of points. Embedding Atlas is available as open source to support future work in embedding-based analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://apple.github.io/embedding-atlas/</p></details> |
| **[Robust Score-Based Quickest Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11094v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work selects a pair of least-favorable distributions from these sets to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript.

| **[Unitary designs in nearly optimal depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06216v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$, $\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count $\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of pseudorandom unitaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+31 ...</summary><p>8+31 pages, 3+1 figures</p></details> |
| **[StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12491v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>tech ...</summary><p>tech report, the code is available at https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion</p></details> |
| **[Modern Methods in Associative Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06211v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Associative Memories like the famous Hopfield Networks are elegant models for describing fully recurrent neural networks whose fundamental job is to store and retrieve information. In the past few years they experienced a surge of interest due to novel theoretical results pertaining to their information storage capabilities, and their relationship with SOTA AI architectures, such as Transformers and Diffusion Models. These connections open up possibilities for interpreting the computation of traditional AI networks through the theoretical lens of Associative Memories. Additionally, novel Lagrangian formulations of these networks make it possible to design powerful distributed models that learn useful representations and inform the design of novel architectures. This tutorial provides an approachable introduction to Associative Memories, emphasizing the modern language and methods used in this area of research, with practical hands-on mathematical derivations and coding notebooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tutor...</summary><p>Tutorial at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[CultureCLIP: Empowering CLIP with Cultural Awareness through Synthetic Images and Contextualized Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06210v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities. Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.</p></details> | 25 pages, COLM 2025 |
| **[Efficient Implementation of Gaussian Process Regression Accelerated Saddle Point Searches with Application to Molecular Reactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12519v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of locating first order saddle points on high-dimensional surfaces describing the variation of energy as a function of atomic coordinates is an essential step for identifying the mechanism and estimating the rate of thermally activated events within the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. When combined directly with electronic structure calculations, the number of energy and atomic force evaluations needed for convergence is a primary issue. Here, we describe an efficient implementation of Gaussian process regression (GPR) acceleration of the minimum mode following method where a dimer is used to estimate the lowest eigenmode of the Hessian. A surrogate energy surface is constructed and updated after each electronic structure calculation. The method is applied to a test set of 500 molecular reactions previously generated by Hermez and coworkers [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 18, 6974 (2022)]. An order of magnitude reduction in the number of electronic structure calculations needed to reach the saddle point configurations is obtained by using the GPR compared to the dimer method. Despite the wide range in stiffness of the molecular degrees of freedom, the calculations are carried out using Cartesian coordinates and are found to require similar number of electronic structure calculations as an elaborate internal coordinate method implemented in the Sella software package. The present implementation of the GPR surrogate model in C++ is efficient enough for the wall time of the saddle point searches to be reduced in 3 out of 4 cases even though the calculations are carried out at a low Hartree-Fock level.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce UQLM, a Python package for LLM hallucination detection using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques. This toolkit offers a suite of UQ-based scorers that compute response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. This library provides an off-the-shelf solution for UQ-based hallucination detection that can be easily integrated to enhance the reliability of LLM outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of Machine Learning Research (MLOSS); UQLM Repository: https://github.com/cvs-health/uqlm</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Play Ô Ăn Quan Game? A Study of Multi-Step Planning and Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03711v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to plan and make decisions through the lens of the traditional Vietnamese board game, \^O \u{A}n Quan. This game, which involves a series of strategic token movements and captures, offers a unique environment for evaluating the decision-making and strategic capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we develop various agent personas, ranging from aggressive to defensive, and employ the \^O \u{A}n Quan game as a testbed for assessing LLM performance across different strategies. Through experimentation with models like Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, we aim to understand how these models execute strategic decision-making, plan moves, and manage dynamic game states. The results will offer insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in terms of reasoning and strategy, contributing to a deeper understanding of their general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at MAPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Delta Learning Hypothesis: Preference Tuning on Weak Data can Yield Strong Gains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06187v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improvements in language models are often driven by improving the quality of the data we train them on, which can be limiting when strong supervision is scarce. In this work, we show that paired preference data consisting of individually weak data points can enable gains beyond the strength of each individual data point. We formulate the delta learning hypothesis to explain this phenomenon, positing that the relative quality delta between points suffices to drive learning via preference tuning--even when supervised finetuning on the weak data hurts. We validate our hypothesis in controlled experiments and at scale, where we post-train 8B models on preference data generated by pairing a small 3B model's responses with outputs from an even smaller 1.5B model to create a meaningful delta. Strikingly, on a standard 11-benchmark evaluation suite (MATH, MMLU, etc.), our simple recipe matches the performance of Tulu 3, a state-of-the-art open model tuned from the same base model while relying on much stronger supervisors (e.g., GPT-4o). Thus, delta learning enables simpler and cheaper open recipes for state-of-the-art post-training. To better understand delta learning, we prove in logistic regression that the performance gap between two weak teacher models provides useful signal for improving a stronger student. Overall, our work shows that models can learn surprisingly well from paired data that might typically be considered weak.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[Fast Bilateral Teleoperation and Imitation Learning Using Sensorless Force Control via Accurate Dynamics Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06174v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to CoRL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Agile Tensile Perching for Aerial Robots from Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06172v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perching on structures such as trees, beams, and ledges is essential for extending the endurance of aerial robots by enabling energy conservation in standby or observation modes. A tethered tensile perching mechanism offers a simple, adaptable solution that can be retrofitted to existing robots and accommodates a variety of structure sizes and shapes. However, tethered tensile perching introduces significant modelling challenges which require precise management of aerial robot dynamics, including the cases of tether slack & tension, and momentum transfer. Achieving smooth wrapping and secure anchoring by targeting a specific tether segment adds further complexity. In this work, we present a novel trajectory framework for tethered tensile perching, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) through the Soft Actor-Critic from Demonstrations (SACfD) algorithm. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations, our approach enhances training efficiency and responsiveness, achieving precise control over position and velocity. This framework enables the aerial robot to accurately target specific tether segments, facilitating reliable wrapping and secure anchoring. We validate our framework through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, and demonstrate effectiveness in achieving agile and reliable trajectory generation for tensile perching.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[LAKEGEN: A LLM-based Tabular Corpus Generator for Evaluating Dataset Discovery in Data Lakes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04687v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to generate a large, realistic set of tables along with joinability relationships, to stress-test dataset discovery methods? Dataset discovery methods aim to automatically identify related data assets in a data lake. The development and evaluation of such solutions for customers from a wide range of business domains, relies on diverse, high quality and domain-specific tabular benchmarks. Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a wide variety of text data, which can provide a strong foundation of general and domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we ask the question -- \textit{can we leverage LLMs to generate a tabular benchmark adequate for evaluating the dataset discovery solutions?} In particular, we focus on the task of finding joinable tables which is the cornerstone of virtually every dataset discovery method. Current corpora for evaluating dataset discovery methods are mainly based on subsets of open data, and they suffer from three important issues: $i)$ they focus on very common and generic data types (e.g., address, id, name, etc.); $ii)$ they do not contain human-annotated column pairs; instead, practitioners synthesize ground truth using table splits (e.g., horizontal for table union search and vertical ones for joinability) and $iii)$ they do not focus on semantic column relationships.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A simple layered-wheel-like construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06169v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been significant interest in characterizing the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth and pathwidth. While this has recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open, and prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like obstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each branching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete subgraphs. There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather involved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our construction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be arbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and (c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has treewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several previously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most one satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c) simultaneously. In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that every graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must contain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction provides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to have arbitrarily large girth.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |
| **[OmniPart: Part-Aware 3D Generation with Semantic Decoupling and Structural Cohesion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06165v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The creation of 3D assets with explicit, editable part structures is crucial for advancing interactive applications, yet most generative methods produce only monolithic shapes, limiting their utility. We introduce OmniPart, a novel framework for part-aware 3D object generation designed to achieve high semantic decoupling among components while maintaining robust structural cohesion. OmniPart uniquely decouples this complex task into two synergistic stages: (1) an autoregressive structure planning module generates a controllable, variable-length sequence of 3D part bounding boxes, critically guided by flexible 2D part masks that allow for intuitive control over part decomposition without requiring direct correspondences or semantic labels; and (2) a spatially-conditioned rectified flow model, efficiently adapted from a pre-trained holistic 3D generator, synthesizes all 3D parts simultaneously and consistently within the planned layout. Our approach supports user-defined part granularity, precise localization, and enables diverse downstream applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPart achieves state-of-the-art performance, paving the way for more interpretable, editable, and versatile 3D content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://omnipart.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[HyperGaussians: High-Dimensional Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Animatable Face Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02803v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gserifi.github.io/HyperGaussians, Code: https://github.com/gserifi/HyperGaussians</p></details> |
| **[Normalizing Diffusion Kernels with Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06161v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smoothing a signal based on local neighborhoods is a core operation in machine learning and geometry processing. On well-structured domains such as vector spaces and manifolds, the Laplace operator derived from differential geometry offers a principled approach to smoothing via heat diffusion, with strong theoretical guarantees. However, constructing such Laplacians requires a carefully defined domain structure, which is not always available. Most practitioners thus rely on simple convolution kernels and message-passing layers, which are biased against the boundaries of the domain. We bridge this gap by introducing a broad class of smoothing operators, derived from general similarity or adjacency matrices, and demonstrate that they can be normalized into diffusion-like operators that inherit desirable properties from Laplacians. Our approach relies on a symmetric variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm, which rescales positive smoothing operators to match the structural behavior of heat diffusion. This construction enables Laplacian-like smoothing and processing of irregular data such as point clouds, sparse voxel grids or mixture of Gaussians. We show that the resulting operators not only approximate heat diffusion but also retain spectral information from the Laplacian itself, with applications to shape analysis and matching.</p></details> | 33 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06108v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages and 9 Figures</p></details> |

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated potential in modeling cooperative behaviors, but most RL-based approaches remain constrained to simplified simulations with limited dynamics or fixed scenarios. Previous attempts to deploy RL policy to real-world pursuit-evasion are largely restricted to two-dimensional scenarios, such as ground vehicles or UAVs at fixed altitudes. In this paper, we address multi-UAV pursuit-evasion by considering UAV dynamics and physical constraints. We introduce an evader prediction-enhanced network to tackle partial observability in cooperative strategy learning. Additionally, we propose an adaptive environment generator within MARL training, enabling higher exploration efficiency and better policy generalization across diverse scenarios. Simulations show our method significantly outperforms all baselines in challenging scenarios, generalizing to unseen scenarios with a 100% capture rate. Finally, we derive a feasible policy via a two-stage reward refinement and deploy the policy on real quadrotors in a zero-shot manner.

Despite these achievements, the theoretical understanding of transformers' capabilities remains limited. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical capabilities of transformers to autoregressively generate sequences in Bayesian networks based on in-context maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Specifically, we consider a setting where a context is formed by a set of independent sequences generated according to a Bayesian network. We demonstrate that there exists a simple transformer model that can (i) estimate the conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network according to the context, and (ii) autoregressively generate a new sample according to the Bayesian network with estimated conditional probabilities. We further demonstrate in extensive experiments that such a transformer does not only exist in theory, but can also be effectively obtained through training. Our analysis highlights the potential of transformers to learn complex probabilistic models and contributes to a better understanding of large language models as a powerful class of sequence generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Free Conditional Diffusion for Multi-object Image Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06146v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models has underpinned much recent advances of dataset augmentation in various computer vision tasks. However, when involving generating multi-object images as real scenarios, most existing methods either rely entirely on text condition, resulting in a deviation between the generated objects and the original data, or rely too much on the original images, resulting in a lack of diversity in the generated images, which is of limited help to downstream tasks. To mitigate both problems with one stone, we propose a prompt-free conditional diffusion framework for multi-object image augmentation. Specifically, we introduce a local-global semantic fusion strategy to extract semantics from images to replace text, and inject knowledge into the diffusion model through LoRA to alleviate the category deviation between the original model and the target dataset. In addition, we design a reward model based counting loss to assist the traditional reconstruction loss for model training. By constraining the object counts of each category instead of pixel-by-pixel constraints, bridging the quantity deviation between the generated data and the original data while improving the diversity of the generated data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over several representative state-of-the-art baselines and showcase strong downstream task gain and out-of-domain generalization capabilities.

Existing deep learning-based denoising methods focus primarily on pixel-level mappings, overlooking the potential benefits of high-level semantic guidance. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that language can serve as a powerful tool for capturing structured semantic information, offering new opportunities to improve LDCT reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce LangMamba, a Language-driven Mamba framework for LDCT denoising that leverages VLM-derived representations to enhance supervision from normal-dose CT (NDCT). LangMamba follows a two-stage learning strategy. First, we pre-train a Language-guided AutoEncoder (LangAE) that leverages frozen VLMs to map NDCT images into a semantic space enriched with anatomical information. Second, we synergize LangAE with two key components to guide LDCT denoising: Semantic-Enhanced Efficient Denoiser (SEED), which enhances NDCT-relevant local semantic while capturing global features with efficient Mamba mechanism, and Language-engaged Dual-space Alignment (LangDA) Loss, which ensures that denoised images align with NDCT in both perceptual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that LangMamba outperforms conventional state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving detail preservation and visual fidelity. Remarkably, LangAE exhibits strong generalizability to unseen datasets, thereby reducing training costs. Furthermore, LangDA loss improves explainability by integrating language-guided insights into image reconstruction and offers a plug-and-play fashion. Our findings shed new light on the potential of language as a supervisory signal to advance LDCT denoising. The code is publicly available on https://github.com/hao1635/LangMamba.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current and potential applications. An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also, missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials, suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG. NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG. Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably, NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |
| **[The Perils of Optimizing Learned Reward Functions: Low Training Error Does Not Guarantee Low Regret](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15753v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning, specifying reward functions that capture the intended task can be very challenging. Reward learning aims to address this issue by learning the reward function. However, a learned reward model may have a low error on the data distribution, and yet subsequently produce a policy with large regret. We say that such a reward model has an error-regret mismatch. The main source of an error-regret mismatch is the distributional shift that commonly occurs during policy optimization. In this paper, we mathematically show that a sufficiently low expected test error of the reward model guarantees low worst-case regret, but that for any fixed expected test error, there exist realistic data distributions that allow for error-regret mismatch to occur. We then show that similar problems persist even when using policy regularization techniques, commonly employed in methods such as RLHF. We hope our results stimulate the theoretical and empirical study of improved methods to learn reward models, and better ways to measure their quality reliably.</p></details> | 72 pages, 4 figures |

Effective performance in this domain requires coordinating a multi-robot inspection team to prioritize inspecting locations more likely to need immediate response, while also minimizing travel time. This is particularly challenging because robots must directly observe the locations to determine which ones require additional attention. This work introduces a multi-robot planning framework for coordinated time-critical multi-robot search under uncertainty. Our approach uses a graph neural network to estimate the likelihood of PoIs needing attention from noisy sensor data and then uses those predictions to guide a multi-robot model-based planner to determine the cost-effective plan. Simulated experiments demonstrate that our planner improves performance at least by 16.3\%, 26.7\%, and 26.2\% for 1, 3, and 5 robots, respectively, compared to non-learned and learned baselines. We also validate our approach on real-world platforms using quad-copters.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, CASE 2025</p></details> |

Using tracking data, we propose a Bayesian mixed-effects model with heterogeneous variances for assessing a player's ability to make variable directional adjustments while moving on the field. We model the turn angle (i.e., angle between successive displacement vectors) for NFL ball carriers on both passing and rushing plays, focusing on receivers after the catch and running backs after the handoff. In particular, we consider a von Mises distribution for the frame-level turn angle and explicitly model both the mean and concentration parameters with relevant spatiotemporal and contextual covariates. Of primary interest, we include player random effects that allow the turn angle concentration to vary by ball carrier nested within position groups. This offers practical insight into player evaluation, as it reveals the shiftiest ball carriers with great variability in turning behavior. We illustrate our approach with results from the first nine weeks of the 2022 NFL regular season and explore player-specific and positional differences in turn angle variability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) framework provides a way of leveraging both a large pool of pseudo-labelled data and a small sample with real, high-quality labels to produce a low-variance, unbiased estimate of the quantity being evaluated for. Most work on PPI considers a relatively sizable set of labelled samples, which can be resource intensive to obtain. However, we find that when labelled data is scarce, the PPI++ method can perform even worse than classical inference. We analyze this phenomenon by relating PPI++ to ordinary least squares regression, which also experiences high variance with small sample sizes, and use this regression framework to better understand the efficacy of PPI. Motivated by this, we present two new PPI-based techniques that leverage robust regressors to produce even lower variance estimators in the few-label regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented as a conference paper at ICML 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we build a large-scale, matting-level semantic segmentation dataset, named MaSS13K, which consists of 13,348 real-world images, all at 4K resolution. MaSS13K provides high-quality mask annotations of a number of objects, which are categorized into seven categories: human, vegetation, ground, sky, water, building, and others. MaSS13K features precise masks, with an average mask complexity 20-50 times higher than existing semantic segmentation datasets. We consequently present a method specifically designed for high-resolution semantic segmentation, namely MaSSFormer, which employs an efficient pixel decoder that aggregates high-level semantic features and low-level texture features across three stages, aiming to produce high-resolution masks with minimal computational cost. Finally, we propose a new learning paradigm, which integrates the high-quality masks of the seven given categories with pseudo labels from new classes, enabling MaSSFormer to transfer its accurate segmentation capability to other classes of objects. Our proposed MaSSFormer is comprehensively evaluated on the MaSS13K benchmark together with 14 representative segmentation models. We expect that our meticulously annotated MaSS13K dataset and the MaSSFormer model can facilitate the research of high-resolution and high-quality semantic segmentation.

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://sais-fuxi.github.io/Omni-Video/</p></details> |

Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.07540 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Safe Beyond the Horizon: Efficient Sampling-based MPC with Neural Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15006v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common problem when using model predictive control (MPC) in practice is the satisfaction of safety specifications beyond the prediction horizon. While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to ``black-box'' dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments. Project website: https://mit-realm.github.io/ns-vimpc/.</p></details> | Accepted by RSS 2025 |

Achieving this goal requires a deep understanding of the frontiers of human knowledge. As such, Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) provides an exceptionally challenging touchstone for evaluating scientific AI agents. In this work, we aim to construct the foundational architecture for general-purpose agents and validate the capabilities through leading performance on HLE. To achieve this, we introduce X-Master, a tool-augmented reasoning agent designed to emulate human researchers by interacting flexibly with external tools during its reasoning process. This agent, guided by the conceptualization of code as an interaction language, can flexibly leverage built-in Python libraries and our customized tools to augment the reasoning. We further scale its capabilities through X-Masters, a scattered-and-stacked agentic workflow that systematically enhances breadth and depth of reasoning. Our open-source solution, X-Masters, sets a new state-of-the-art record on HLE with a score of 32.1%, surpassing OpenAI's and Google's Deep Research (26.6% and 26.9%) and becoming the first to exceed the 30% threshold.

Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>tech ...</summary><p>tech report, the code is available at https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states.

Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them.

While these methods perform well under controlled conditions, their accuracy drops significantly in real-world scenarios where the audio is captured via mobile devices in noisy environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol designed to better reflect such real-world conditions. We generate three recordings of the same audio, each with increasing levels of noise, captured using a mobile device's microphone. Our results reveal a substantial performance drop for two state-of-the-art CNN-based models under this protocol, compared to previously reported benchmarks. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of the augmentation pipeline during training with contrastive loss. By introduction low pass and high pass filters in the augmentation pipeline we significantly increase the performance of both systems in our proposed evaluation. Furthermore, we develop a transformer-based model with a tailored projection module and demonstrate that transferring knowledge from a semantically relevant domain yields a more robust solution. The transformer architecture outperforms CNN-based models across all noise levels, and query durations. In low noise conditions it achieves 47.99% for 1-sec queries, and 97% for 10-sec queries in finding the correct song, surpassing by 14%, and by 18.5% the second-best performing model, respectively, Under heavy noise levels, we achieve a detection rate 56.5% for 15-second query duration.

| **[Adaptive Tool Use in Large Language Models with Meta-Cognition Trigger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12961v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent capabilities, transforming the execution of functional tasks by leveraging external tools for complex problems that require specialized processing or up-to-date data. While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool calls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks show that MeCo reliably detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, camera ready version for ACL-2025</p></details> |

While these models have demonstrated transformative potential in productivity and communication, they overwhelmingly cater to high-resource languages like English. This has amplified concerns over linguistic inequality in natural language processing (NLP). This paper presents the first systematic review focused specifically on strategies to address data scarcity in generative language modelling for low-resource languages (LRL). Drawing from 54 studies, we identify, categorise and evaluate technical approaches, including monolingual data augmentation, back-translation, multilingual training, and prompt engineering, across generative tasks. We also analyse trends in architecture choices, language family representation, and evaluation methods. Our findings highlight a strong reliance on transformer-based models, a concentration on a small subset of LRLs, and a lack of consistent evaluation across studies. We conclude with recommendations for extending these methods to a wider range of LRLs and outline open challenges in building equitable generative language systems. Ultimately, this review aims to support researchers and developers in building inclusive AI tools for underrepresented languages, a necessary step toward empowering LRL speakers and the preservation of linguistic diversity in a world increasingly shaped by large-scale language technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is currently under review.

However, most existing methods face challenges in maintaining robustness under complex weather conditions, which limits their applicability. Meanwhile, the reliance on attention mechanisms in modality fusion introduces significant computational complexity and storage overhead, particularly when dealing with high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we propose the Cross-modality Fusion Mamba with Weather-removal (CFMW) to augment stability and cost-effectiveness under adverse weather conditions. Leveraging the proposed Perturbation-Adaptive Diffusion Model (PADM) and Cross-modality Fusion Mamba (CFM) modules, CFMW is able to reconstruct visual features affected by adverse weather, enriching the representation of image details. With efficient architecture design, CFMW is 3 times faster than Transformer-style fusion (e.g., CFT). To bridge the gap in relevant datasets, we construct a new Severe Weather Visible-Infrared (SWVI) dataset, encompassing diverse adverse weather scenarios such as rain, haze, and snow. The dataset contains 64,281 paired visible-infrared images, providing a valuable resource for future research. Extensive experiments on public datasets (i.e., M3FD and LLVIP) and the newly constructed SWVI dataset conclusively demonstrate that CFMW achieves state-of-the-art detection performance.

However, reconstructing accurate radio maps from sparse measurements remains challenging. Traditional interpolation and inpainting methods lack environmental awareness, while many deep learning approaches depend on detailed scene data, limiting generalization. To address this, we propose MARS, a Multi-scale Aware Radiomap Super-resolution method that combines CNNs and Transformers with multi-scale feature fusion and residual connections. MARS focuses on both global and local feature extraction, enhancing feature representation across different receptive fields and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments across different scenes and antenna locations show that MARS outperforms baseline models in both MSE and SSIM, while maintaining low computational cost, demonstrating strong practical potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors withdraw this submission to substantially revise the introduction and experimental sections and incorporate new content.

| **[Geo-Registration of Terrestrial LiDAR Point Clouds with Satellite Images without GNSS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05999v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate geo-registration of LiDAR point clouds presents significant challenges in GNSS signal denied urban areas with high-rise buildings and bridges. Existing methods typically rely on real-time GNSS and IMU data, that require pre-calibration and assume stable positioning during data collection. However, this assumption often fails in dense urban areas, resulting in localization errors. To address this, we propose a structured geo-registration and spatial correction method that aligns 3D point clouds with satellite images, enabling frame-wise recovery of GNSS information and reconstruction of city scale 3D maps without relying on prior localization. The proposed approach employs a pre-trained Point Transformer model to segment the road points and then extracts the road skeleton and intersection points from the point cloud as well as the target map for alignment. Global rigid alignment of the two is performed using the intersection points, followed by local refinement using radial basis function (RBF) interpolation. Elevation correction is then applied to the point cloud based on terrain information from SRTM dataset to resolve vertical discrepancies. The proposed method was tested on the popular KITTI benchmark and a locally collected Perth (Western Australia) CBD dataset. On the KITTI dataset, our method achieved an average planimetric alignment standard deviation (STD) of 0.84~m across sequences with intersections, representing a 55.3\% improvement over the original dataset. On the Perth dataset, which lacks GNSS information, our method achieved an average STD of 0.96~m compared to the GPS data extracted from Google Maps API. This corresponds to a 77.4\% improvement from the initial alignment. Our method also resulted in elevation correlation gains of 30.5\% on the KITTI dataset and 50.4\% on the Perth dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transactions on Geoscience & Remote Sensing</p></details> |

The core challenge lies in accurately identifying the ambiguous relationships between labels and instances. In this paper, we emphasize that matching co-occurrence patterns between labels and instances is key to addressing this challenge. To this end, we propose Semantic Co-occurrence Insight Network (SCINet), a novel and effective framework for partial multi-label learning. Specifically, SCINet introduces a bi-dominant prompter module, which leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal model to capture text-image correlations and enhance semantic alignment. To reinforce instance-label interdependencies, we develop a cross-modality fusion module that jointly models inter-label correlations, inter-instance relationships, and co-occurrence patterns across instance-label assignments. Moreover, we propose an intrinsic semantic augmentation strategy that enhances the model's understanding of intrinsic data semantics by applying diverse image transformations, thereby fostering a synergistic relationship between label confidence and sample difficulty. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCINet surpasses state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, Under Review</p></details> |

This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications, such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal in healthcare applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |

| **[Rethinking Associative Memory Mechanism in Induction Head](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11459v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Induction head mechanism is a part of the computational circuits for in-context learning (ICL) that enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks without fine-tuning. Most existing work explains the training dynamics behind acquiring such a powerful mechanism. However, the model's ability to coordinate in-context information over long contexts and global knowledge acquired during pretraining remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how a two-layer transformer thoroughly captures in-context information and balances it with pretrained bigram knowledge in next token prediction, from the viewpoint of associative memory. We theoretically analyze the representation of weight matrices in attention layers and the resulting logits when a transformer is given prompts generated by a bigram model. In the experiments, we design specific prompts to evaluate whether the outputs of the trained transformer align with the theoretical results.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

In this paper, we present Tora2, an enhanced version of Tora, which introduces several design improvements to expand its capabilities in both appearance and motion customization. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled personalization extractor that generates comprehensive personalization embeddings for multiple open-set entities, better preserving fine-grained visual details compared to previous methods. Building on this, we design a gated self-attention mechanism to integrate trajectory, textual description, and visual information for each entity. This innovation significantly reduces misalignment in multimodal conditioning during training. Moreover, we introduce a contrastive loss that jointly optimizes trajectory dynamics and entity consistency through explicit mapping between motion and personalization embeddings. Tora2 is, to our best knowledge, the first method to achieve simultaneous multi-entity customization of appearance and motion for video generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Tora2 achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art customization methods while providing advanced motion control capabilities, which marks a critical advancement in multi-condition video generation.

This shift significantly increases throughput and transactions per second (TPS), while ensuring conflict-free execution in both proposer and attestor modes and preserving execution order consistency in the attestor. At the heart of Conthereum is a novel, lightweight, high-performance scheduler inspired by the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSS). We propose a custom greedy heuristic algorithm, along with its efficient implementation, that solves this formulation effectively and decisively outperforms existing scheduling methods in finding suboptimal solutions that satisfy the constraints, achieve minimal makespan, and maximize speedup in parallel execution. Additionally, Conthereum includes an offline phase that equips its real-time scheduler with a conflict analysis repository obtained through static analysis of smart contracts, identifying potentially conflicting functions using a pessimistic approach. Building on this novel scheduler and extensive conflict data, Conthereum outperforms existing concurrent intra-block solutions. Empirical evaluations show near-linear throughput gains with increasing computational power on standard 8-core machines. Although scalability deviates from linear with higher core counts and increased transaction conflicts, Conthereum still significantly improves upon the current sequential execution model and outperforms existing concurrent solutions under a wide range of conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures, 1 algorithms</p></details> |

However, traditional silicon-based and hybrid electronic technologies for artificial neurons constrain neuromorphic processors in terms of flexibility, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the use of Doped-Gain-Layer-on-Waveguide-Synapses for bio-inspired neurons, utilizing a pulsed pump-signal mechanism to enhance neuromorphic computation. This approach addresses critical challenges in scalability and energy efficiency inherent in current technologies. We introduce the concept of Gain on Waveguide Dynamics for synapses, demonstrating how non-linear pulse transformations of input probe signals occur under various pump-probe configurations. Our findings reveal that primarily properties of pulse amplitude, period as well material properties such as doping densities and population dynamics influence strongly the generation of spiking responses that emulate neuronal behaviour and effectively how computational logic is. By harnessing the complex interactions of asynchronous spiking pump techniques and ion densities in excited states, our method produces event-driven responses that mirror natural neuronal functions. This gain-enhanced environment supports short-term memory capabilities alongside essential characteristics like asynchronous spike generation, threshold operation, and temporal integration, foundational to brain-inspired spiking neural network paradigms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Hence, analyzing and interpreting tabular data is of utmost importance. Application tasks on tabular data are manifold and are often not specified when setting up an industrial database. To address this, we present a novel framework for generating universal, i.e., task-independent embeddings of tabular data for performing downstream tasks without predefined targets. Our method transforms tabular data into a graph structure, leverages Graph Auto-Encoders to create entity embeddings, which are subsequently aggregated to obtain embeddings for each table row, i.e., each data sample. This two-step approach has the advantage that unseen samples, consisting of similar entities, can be embedded without additional training. Downstream tasks such as regression, classification or outlier detection, can then be performed by applying a distance-based similarity measure in the embedding space. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing universal tabular data embedding techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Tabular Data Analysis (TaDA) Workshop at VLDB 2025</p></details> |

No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>trans...</summary><p>transformer example extended, discussion and speculation section added</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchy or Heterarchy? A Theory of Long-Range Connections for the Sensorimotor Brain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05888v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the traditional understanding of the neocortex, sensory information flows up a hierarchy of regions, with each level processing increasingly complex features. Information also flows down the hierarchy via a different set of connections. Although the hierarchical model has significant support, many anatomical connections do not conform to the standard hierarchical interpretation. In addition, hierarchically arranged regions sometimes respond in parallel, not sequentially as would occur in a hierarchy. This and other evidence suggests that two regions can act in parallel and hierarchically at the same time. Given this flexibility, the word "heterarchy" might be a more suitable term to describe neocortical organization. This paper proposes a new interpretation of how sensory and motor information is processed in the neocortex. The key to our proposal is what we call the "Thousand Brains Theory", which posits that every cortical column is a sensorimotor learning system. Columns learn by integrating sensory input over multiple movements of a sensor. In this view, even primary and secondary regions, such as V1 and V2, can learn and recognize complete 3D objects. This suggests that the hierarchical connections between regions are used to learn the compositional structure of parent objects composed of smaller child objects. We explain the theory by examining the different types of long-range connections between cortical regions and between the neocortex and thalamus. We describe these connections, and then suggest the specific roles they play in the context of a heterarchy of sensorimotor regions. We also suggest that the thalamus plays an essential role in transforming the pose between objects and sensors. The novel perspective we argue for here has broad implications for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |

Physics-driven (PD) models have gained prominence in reconstruction tasks due to their desirable performance and generalization. These models jointly promote data fidelity and artifact suppression, typically by combining data-consistency mechanisms with learned network modules. Artifact suppression depends on the network's ability to disentangle artifacts from true tissue signals, both of which can exhibit contextual structure across diverse spatial scales. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are strong in capturing local correlations, albeit relatively insensitive to non-local context. While transformers promise to alleviate this limitation, practical implementations frequently involve design compromises to reduce computational cost by balancing local and non-local sensitivity, occasionally resulting in performance comparable to or trailing that of CNNs. To enhance contextual sensitivity without incurring high complexity, we introduce a novel physics-driven autoregressive state-space model (MambaRoll) for medical image reconstruction. In each cascade of its unrolled architecture, MambaRoll employs a physics-driven state-space module (PD-SSM) to aggregate contextual features efficiently at a given spatial scale, and autoregressively predicts finer-scale feature maps conditioned on coarser-scale features to capture multi-scale context. Learning across scales is further enhanced via a deep multi-scale decoding (DMSD) loss tailored to the autoregressive prediction task. Demonstrations on accelerated MRI and sparse-view CT reconstructions show that MambaRoll consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven and physics-driven methods based on CNN, transformer, and SSM backbones.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its dynamic extensions have enabled high-fidelity scene modeling. However, existing methods often couple scene reconstruction with optimization-dependent coding, which limits generalizability. This paper presents Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (D-FCGS), a novel feedforward framework for compressing temporally correlated Gaussian point cloud sequences. Our approach introduces a Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P frame coding, where inter-frame motions are extracted via sparse control points. The resulting motion tensors are compressed in a feedforward manner using a dual prior-aware entropy model that combines hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation. For reconstruction, we perform control-point-guided motion compensation and employ a refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on multi-view video-derived Gaussian frames, D-FCGS generalizes across scenes without per-scene optimization. Experiments show that it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods, achieving over 40 times compression in under 2 seconds while preserving visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression for dynamic 3DGS, paving the way for scalable FVV transmission and storage in immersive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1) provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in accuracy over baseline algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MICCAI 2025, used llncs document class</p></details> |

However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |

Although recent approaches leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved performance in the open-vocabulary setting, they commonly ignore the inherent limitations of VLMs in spatial relation reasoning, such as difficulty in distinguishing object relative positions, which results in suboptimal relation prediction. Motivated by the denoising diffusion model's inversion process in preserving the spatial structure of input images, we propose SPADE (SPatial-Aware Denoising-nEtwork) framework -- a novel approach for open-vocabulary PSG. SPADE consists of two key steps: (1) inversion-guided calibration for the UNet adaptation, and (2) spatial-aware context reasoning. In the first step, we calibrate a general pre-trained teacher diffusion model into a PSG-specific denoising network with cross-attention maps derived during inversion through a lightweight LoRA-based fine-tuning strategy. In the second step, we develop a spatial-aware relation graph transformer that captures both local and long-range contextual information, facilitating the generation of high-quality relation queries. Extensive experiments on benchmark PSG and Visual Genome datasets demonstrate that SPADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both closed- and open-set scenarios, particularly for spatial relationship prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting.

We introduce a novel approach to address this discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding, without compromising base performance.

In the Clarity Prediction Challenge 2 (CPC2), non-intrusive binaural SIP models based on transformers showed high prediction accuracy. However, the self-attention mechanism theoretically incurs high computational and memory costs, making it a bottleneck for low-latency, power-efficient devices. This may also degrade the temporal processing of binaural SIPs. Therefore, we propose Mamba-based SIP models instead of transformers for the temporal processing blocks. Experimental results show that our proposed SIP model achieves competitive performance compared to the baseline while maintaining a relatively small number of parameters. Our analysis suggests that the SIP model based on bidirectional Mamba effectively captures contextual and spatial speech information from binaural signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

The multiple-scattering FTH-MS method is based on a partition of the domain boundary into a user-prescribed set of overlapping open arcs, along with a corresponding sequence of multiple-scattering problems that effectively decompose the interior problem into a series of open-arc wave equation subproblems. The new strategy provides a significant extension of the original FTH-MS algorithm originally presented in [22], in that (1) By allowing for use of an arbitrary of number of component arcs, and not just two as in the previous contribution, the new approach affords (1a) A significantly increased geometric flexibility, as well as, (1b) The use of partitions for which each open arc leads to small numbers of iterations if iterative linear-algebra solvers are employed; and, (2) It facilitates parallelization -- as the subproblem solutions that are needed at each multiple scattering step can be evaluated in an embarrassingly parallel fashion. Utilizing a suitably-implemented Fourier transformation, each sub-problem is reduced to a Helmholtz frequency-domain problem that is tackled via a uniquely-solvable boundary integral equation. Similar FTH-MS methods are also presented for problems exterior to a number of bounded obstacles. All of the algorithms considered incorporate the previously introduced ``time-windowing and recentering'' methodology (that enables both treatment of incident signals of long duration and long time simulation), as well as a high-frequency Fourier transform algorithm that delivers numerically dispersionless, spectrally-accurate time evolution for arbitrarily long times.</p></details> | 28 pages, 17 figures |

However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

However, when it comes to long context scenarios, the performance of LLMs degrades due to some challenges. To alleviate this phenomenon, there is a number of work proposed recently. In this survey, we first list the challenges of applying pre-trained LLMs to process long contexts. Then systematically review the approaches related to long context and propose our taxonomy categorizing them into four main types: positional encoding, context compression, retrieval augmented, and attention pattern. In addition to the approaches, we focus on the evaluation of long context, organizing relevant data, tasks, and metrics based on existing long context benchmarks. Finally, we summarize unresolved issues in the long context domain and put forward our views on future developments.</p></details> | preprint |

Evaluating Generalist Text Embeddings for Zero-Shot Recommendation and Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05006v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are widely used to derive semantic representations from item metadata in recommendation and search. In sequential recommendation, PLMs enhance ID-based embeddings through textual metadata, while in product search, they align item characteristics with user intent. Recent studies suggest task and domain-specific fine-tuning are needed to improve representational power. This paper challenges this assumption, showing that Generalist Text Embedding Models (GTEs), pre-trained on large-scale corpora, can guarantee strong zero-shot performance without specialized adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that GTEs outperform traditional and fine-tuned models in both sequential recommendation and product search. We attribute this to a superior representational power, as they distribute features more evenly across the embedding space. Finally, we show that compressing embedding dimensions by focusing on the most informative directions (e.g., via PCA) effectively reduces noise and improves the performance of specialized models.

COMPASS handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, COMPASS evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning for Astrophysics</p></details> |

In contrast to prior work on SSC that heavily relies on expensive ground-truth annotations, we approach SSC in an unsupervised setting. Our novel method, SceneDINO, adapts techniques from self-supervised representation learning and 2D unsupervised scene understanding to SSC. Our training exclusively utilizes multi-view consistency self-supervision without any form of semantic or geometric ground truth. Given a single input image, SceneDINO infers the 3D geometry and expressive 3D DINO features in a feed-forward manner. Through a novel 3D feature distillation approach, we obtain unsupervised 3D semantics. In both 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding, SceneDINO reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. Linear probing our 3D features matches the segmentation accuracy of a current supervised SSC approach. Additionally, we showcase the domain generalization and multi-view consistency of SceneDINO, taking the first steps towards a strong foundation for single image 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICCV 2025.

However, people often encounter "friction" when using embedding visualization tools: (1) barriers to adoption, e.g., tedious data wrangling and loading, scalability limits, no integration of results into existing workflows, and (2) limitations in possible analyses, without integration with external tools to additionally show coordinated views of metadata. In this paper, we present Embedding Atlas, a scalable, interactive visualization tool designed to make interacting with large embeddings as easy as possible. Embedding Atlas uses modern web technologies and advanced algorithms -- including density-based clustering, and automated labeling -- to provide a fast and rich data analysis experience at scale. We evaluate Embedding Atlas with a competitive analysis against other popular embedding tools, showing that Embedding Atlas's feature set specifically helps reduce friction, and report a benchmark on its real-time rendering performance with millions of points. Embedding Atlas is available as open source to support future work in embedding-based analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://apple.github.io/embedding-atlas/</p></details> |

However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to CoRL 2025</p></details> |

Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gserifi.github.io/HyperGaussians, Code: https://github.com/gserifi/HyperGaussians</p></details> |
| **[Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06108v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages and 9 Figures</p></details> |

We propose an adaptive sigma-point sampling scheme, which ultimately produces a fast, simple algorithm capable of estimating the collision probability with a median error of 3.5%, and a median runtime of 0.21ms, when measured on an Intel Xeon Gold 6226R Processor. Importantly, the algorithm explicitly accounts for the collision probability's temporal dependence, which is often neglected in prior work and otherwise leads to an overestimation of the collision probability. Finally, the method is tested on a diverse set of relevant real-world scenarios, consisting of 400 6-second snippets of autonomous vehicle logs, where the accuracy and latency is rigorously evaluated.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current and potential applications. An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also, missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials, suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) framework provides a way of leveraging both a large pool of pseudo-labelled data and a small sample with real, high-quality labels to produce a low-variance, unbiased estimate of the quantity being evaluated for. Most work on PPI considers a relatively sizable set of labelled samples, which can be resource intensive to obtain. However, we find that when labelled data is scarce, the PPI++ method can perform even worse than classical inference. We analyze this phenomenon by relating PPI++ to ordinary least squares regression, which also experiences high variance with small sample sizes, and use this regression framework to better understand the efficacy of PPI. Motivated by this, we present two new PPI-based techniques that leverage robust regressors to produce even lower variance estimators in the few-label regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented as a conference paper at ICML 2025</p></details> |

This report presents Omni-Video, an efficient and effective unified framework for video understanding, generation, as well as instruction-based editing. Our key insight is to teach existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce continuous visual clues that are used as the input of diffusion decoders, which produce high-quality videos conditioned on these visual clues. To fully unlock the potential of our system for unified video modeling, we integrate several technical improvements: 1) a lightweight architectural design that respectively attaches a vision head on the top of MLLMs and a adapter before the input of diffusion decoders, the former produce visual tokens for the latter, which adapts these visual tokens to the conditional space of diffusion decoders; and 2) an efficient multi-stage training scheme that facilitates a fast connection between MLLMs and diffusion decoders with limited data and computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that our model exhibits satisfactory generalization abilities across video generation, editing and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, project page: https://sais-fuxi.github.io/Omni-Video/</p></details> |

While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to ``black-box'' dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments. Project website: https://mit-realm.github.io/ns-vimpc/.</p></details> | Accepted by RSS 2025 |

LLM unlearning methods aim to remove information on demand from LLMs. Current LLM unlearning methods struggle to balance the unlearning efficacy and utility due to the competing nature of these objectives. Keeping the unlearning process computationally feasible without assuming access to the model weights is an overlooked area. In this work we show that \textit{agents might be all we need for effective and practical inference-time LLM unlearning}. We present the first agentic LLM unlearning (\texttt{ALU}) method, a multi-agent, retrain-free, model-agnostic approach to LLM unlearning that achieves effective unlearning while preserving the utility. Our \texttt{ALU} framework unlearns by involving multiple LLM agents, each designed for a specific step in the unlearning process, without the need to update model weights for any of the agents in the framework. Users can easily request any set of unlearning instances in any sequence, and \texttt{ALU} seamlessly adapts in real time. This is facilitated without requiring any changes in the underlying LLM model. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks (TOFU, WMDP, WPU) and jailbreaking techniques (many shot, target masking, other languages), we demonstrate that \texttt{ALU} consistently stands out as the most robust inference-time LLM unlearning framework among current state-of-the-art methods while incurring time cost that remains effectively constant regardless of the number of unlearning targets. We further highlight \texttt{ALU}'s superior performance compared to existing methods when evaluated at scale. Specifically, \texttt{ALU} is assessed on up to 1000 unlearning targets, exceeding the evaluation scope of all previously proposed LLM unlearning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

Despite their strong performance, LRMs often exhibit overthinking -- excessive and redundant reasoning steps that introduce inefficiencies during inference. This phenomenon raises an important question for LRM self-evaluation: How can a model autonomously assess the correctness of its own reasoning trajectory without external labels? To address this, we propose Chain-of-Reasoning Embedding (CoRE), a series of hidden states in latent space to enable label-free self-evaluation on intermediate reasoning steps of LRMs, so as to enhance metacognition abilities for improved reasoning efficiency. By analyzing the geometric properties of the CoRE trajectories, we reveal that redundant reasoning usually presents cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to repetitive and unconscious reflection/exploration. Leveraging this insight, we further introduce a training-free, label-free self-evaluation framework, CoRE-Eval, to detect such patterns and dynamically determine whether to terminate reasoning early. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME) and across model sizes from 7B to 32B demonstrate that CoRE-Eval reduces chain-of-thought length by 13.7% to 33.2% while improving answer accuracy by around 10%, achieving 70.0% accuracy on the challenging AIME benchmark with the 32B model.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration space, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer ineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between exploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting guidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is that we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes challenges in the explainability of the results. In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by causally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn rules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify them with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated reflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these places in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the impact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions can then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial explainability at the landscape level. Comparing with 11 state-of-the-art tuners on 12 systems and varying budgets, we show that PromiseTune performs significantly better than the others with $42\%$ superior rank to the overall second best while providing richer information to explain the hidden system characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSE26</p></details> |

To balance the explore-exploit trade-off successfully, Thompson sampling provides a natural and widespread paradigm to probabilistically select which action to take. Questions of causal and counterfactual inference, which underpin use-cases like offline evaluation, are not straightforward to answer in these contexts. Specifically, whilst most existing estimators rely on action propensities, these are not readily available under Thompson sampling procedures. We derive exact and efficiently computable expressions for action propensities under a variety of parameter and outcome distributions, enabling the use of off-policy estimators in Thompson sampling scenarios. This opens up a range of practical use-cases where counterfactual inference is crucial, including unbiased offline evaluation of recommender systems, as well as general applications of causal inference in online advertising, personalisation, and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the Nineteenth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys '25)</p></details> |

This work proposes a holistic framework for construction task specification, optimization of robot morphology, and mission execution using a mobile modular reconfigurable robot. Users can specify and monitor the desired robot behavior through a graphical interface. In contrast to existing, monolithic solutions, we automatically identify a new task-tailored robot for every task by integrating \acf{bim}. Our framework leverages modular robot components that enable the fast adaption of robot hardware to the specific demands of the construction task. Other than previous works on modular robot optimization, we consider multiple competing objectives, which allow us to explicitly model the challenges of real-world transfer, such as calibration errors. We demonstrate our framework in simulation by optimizing robots for drilling and spray painting. Finally, experimental validation demonstrates that our approach robustly enables the autonomous execution of robotic drilling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036791</p></details> |

While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Efficient Systems for Foundation Models at iCML</p></details> |

However, scaling MCTS to parallel compute has proven challenging in practice which has motivated alternative planners like sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC). Many of these SMC methods adopt particle filters for smoothing through a reformulation of RL as a policy inference problem. Yet, persisting design choices of these particle filters often conflict with the aim of online planning in RL, which is to obtain a policy improvement at the start of planning. Drawing inspiration from MCTS, we tailor SMC planners specifically for RL by improving data generation within the planner through constrained action sampling and explicit terminal state handling, as well as improving policy and value target estimation. This leads to our Trust-Region Twisted SMC (TRT-SMC), which shows improved runtime and sample-efficiency over baseline MCTS and SMC methods in both discrete and continuous domains.</p></details> | Poster at ICML2025 |
| **[On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove that perfect hallucination control in large language models is mathematically impossible. No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>trans...</summary><p>transformer example extended, discussion and speculation section added</p></details> |

Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models provide estimates of population size and spatial density from data collected from remote sensors such as camera traps. Such data contain spatial correlation between observations of the same individual, which SCR models partly account for through a latent individual-specific activity centre, a location near which the individual is more likely detected. However, SCR models assume that the observations of an individual are independent over time and space, conditional on its activity centre, so that observed sightings at a given time and location do not influence the probability of being seen at future times and/or locations. This assumption is ecologically unrealistic given the smooth movement of animals over space through time. We propose a new continuous-time modelling framework that incorporates both an individual's (latent) activity centre and its (known) previous location and time of detection. By formulating the detections of an individual as an inhomogeneous temporal Poisson process, we develop a model drawing inspiration from the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is commonly used to model animal movement. Applying our model to a camera-trap survey of American martens, we observe a substantial improvement in model fit and notable differences in the estimated spatial distribution of activity centres. A simulation study shows that standard SCR models can produce substantially biased population estimates when spatio-temporal dependence is ignored, while the memory-based model remains robust. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for memory of previous detections in SCR models to improve ecological interpretation and inference.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

These issues, exacerbated by token limits, often cause models to miss vulnerability-related signals, thereby impairing effective learning. A key intuition is to enhance LMs with concise, information-rich context. Commit-based annotations offer precise, CWE-agnostic supervision, but are unavailable during inference, as they depend on historical code changes. Moreover, their extreme sparsity, often covering only a few lines, makes it difficult for LMs to process directly. In this paper, we propose FocusVul, a model-agnostic framework that improves LM-based vulnerability detection by learning to select sensitive context. FocusVul learns commit-based annotation patterns through hierarchical semantic modeling and generalizes them to identify line-level vulnerability-relevant regions during inference. It then extracts LM-oriented context via both dependency and execution flows surrounding selected regions, yielding semantically rich inputs for effective vulnerability detection. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that FocusVul consistently outperforms heuristic-based and full-function fine-tuning approaches, improving classification performance by 164.04% and reducing FLOPs by 19.12% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>withd...</summary><p>withdrawal for fixing errors</p></details> |
| **[A novel framework for fully-automated co-registration of intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography imaging data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05883v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aims: To develop a deep-learning (DL) framework that will allow fully automated longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Methods and results: Data from 230 patients (714 vessels) with acute coronary syndrome that underwent near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS and OCT imaging in their non-culprit vessels were included in the present analysis. The lumen borders annotated by expert analysts in 61,655 NIRS-IVUS and 62,334 OCT frames, and the side branches and calcific tissue identified in 10,000 NIRS-IVUS frames and 10,000 OCT frames, were used to train DL solutions for the automated extraction of these features. The trained DL solutions were used to process NIRS-IVUS and OCT images and their output was used by a dynamic time warping algorithm to co-register longitudinally the NIRS-IVUS and OCT images, while the circumferential registration of the IVUS and OCT was optimized through dynamic programming. On a test set of 77 vessels from 22 patients, the DL method showed high concordance with the expert analysts for the longitudinal and circumferential co-registration of the two imaging sets (concordance correlation coefficient >0.99 for the longitudinal and >0.90 for the circumferential co-registration). The Williams Index was 0.96 for longitudinal and 0.97 for circumferential co-registration, indicating a comparable performance to the analysts. The time needed for the DL pipeline to process imaging data from a vessel was <90s. Conclusion: The fully automated, DL-based framework introduced in this study for the co-registration of IVUS and OCT is fast and provides estimations that compare favorably to the expert analysts. These features renders it useful in research in the analysis of large-scale data collected in studies that incorporate multimodality imaging to characterize plaque composition.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[HiBayES: A Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling Framework for AI Evaluation Statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05602v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems evolve, robustly estimating their capabilities from inherently stochastic outputs while systematically quantifying uncertainty in these estimates becomes increasingly important. Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta version) for out-of-the-box implementation.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |

While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations. To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e., operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 19 figures |

Building on the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in Text-to-Speech (TTS) tasks, this study investigates the adaptation of LLM-based techniques for FAC, which we term SpeechAccentLLM. At the core of this framework, we introduce SpeechCodeVAE, the first model to integrate connectionist temporal classification (CTC) directly into codebook discretization for speech content tokenization. This novel architecture generates tokens with a unique "locality" property, as validated by experiments demonstrating optimal trade-offs among content faithfulness, temporal coherence, and structural recoverability. Then, to address data scarcity for the FAC module, we adopted a multitask learning strategy that jointly trains the FAC and TTS modules. Beyond mitigating data limitations, this approach yielded accelerated convergence and superior speech quality compared to standalone FAC training. Moreover, leveraging the salient properties of our discrete speech representations, we introduce SpeechRestorer, a postprocessing architecture designed to refine LLM-generated outputs. This module effectively mitigates stochastic errors prevalent in LLM inference pipelines while enhancing prosodic continuity, as validated by ablation experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, includes references, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Classical and Learning-based Iterative Registration through Deep Equilibrium Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00582v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively, recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps. Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast, DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern learning-based registration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted version.

Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.

We use a learner-verifier procedure that learns a certificate for the specification, represented as a neural network. Verifying that this neural network certificate is a so-called reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM) proves the satisfaction of a reach-avoid specification. Existing approaches for such a verification task rely on computed Lipschitz constants of neural networks. These approaches struggle with large Lipschitz constants, especially for reach-avoid specifications with high threshold probabilities. We present two key contributions to obtain smaller Lipschitz constants than existing approaches. First, we introduce logarithmic RASMs (logRASMs), which take exponentially smaller values than RASMs and hence have lower theoretical Lipschitz constants. Second, we present a fast method to compute tighter upper bounds on Lipschitz constants based on weighted norms. Our empirical evaluation shows we can consistently verify the satisfaction of reach-avoid specifications with probabilities as high as 99.9999%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (with appendix) of the paper presented at CAV 2025</p></details> |

However, fast satellite motion, brief satellite-ground station (GS) contact windows, and large size of the images pose a data download challenge. To enable near real-time Earth observation applications (e.g., disaster and extreme weather monitoring), we should explore how to deploy LVLM in LEO satellite networks, and design SpaceVerse, an efficient satellite-ground synergistic LVLM inference system. To this end, firstly, we deploy compact LVLMs on satellites for lightweight tasks, whereas regular LVLMs operate on GSs to handle computationally intensive tasks. Then, we propose a computing and communication co-design framework comprised of a progressive confidence network and an attention-based multi-scale preprocessing, used to identify on-satellite inferring data, and reduce data redundancy before satellite-GS transmission, separately. We implement and evaluate SpaceVerse on real-world LEO satellite constellations and datasets, achieving a 31.2% average gain in accuracy and a 51.2% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

However, their practical application suffers from inherent dynamic feature instability, leading to error amplification during cached inference. Through systematic analysis, we identify the absence of long-range feature preservation mechanisms as the root cause of unstable feature propagation and perturbation sensitivity. To this end, we propose Skip-DiT, an image and video generative DiT variant enhanced with Long-Skip-Connections (LSCs) - the key efficiency component in U-Nets. Theoretical spectral norm and visualization analysis demonstrate how LSCs stabilize feature dynamics. Skip-DiT architecture and its stabilized dynamic feature enable an efficient statical caching mechanism that reuses deep features across timesteps while updating shallow components. Extensive experiments across the image and video generation tasks demonstrate that Skip-DiT achieves: (1) 4.4 times training acceleration and faster convergence, (2) 1.5-2 times inference acceleration with negligible quality loss and high fidelity to the original output, outperforming existing DiT caching methods across various quantitative metrics. Our findings establish Long-Skip-Connections as critical architectural components for stable and efficient diffusion transformers.

Consistency distillation has recently emerged as a promising alternative by distilling a one-step consistency model from a multi-step diffusion-based teacher model. However, distilled consistency models are inherently biased towards the sampling trajectory of the teacher model, making them less robust to noise and prone to inheriting inaccuracies from the teacher model. To address this limitation, we propose ROSE-CD: Robust One-step Speech Enhancement via Consistency Distillation, a novel approach for distilling a one-step consistency model. Specifically, we introduce a randomized learning trajectory to improve the model's robustness to noise. Furthermore, we jointly optimize the one-step model with two time-domain auxiliary losses, enabling it to recover from teacher-induced errors and surpass the teacher model in overall performance. This is the first pure one-step consistency distillation model for diffusion-based speech enhancement, achieving 54 times faster inference speed and superior performance compared to its 30-step teacher model. Experiments on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality. Moreover, its generalization ability is validated on both an out-of-domain dataset and real-world noisy recordings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE WASPAA 2025. 6 pages, 1 figures</p></details> |

SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing sequential approximate verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This reduces the number of calls to the larger LLM, achieving further speedups and lower computation cost. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025, Workshop on Efficient Systems for Foundation Models</p></details> |

Most TSAD methods driven by forecasting models tend to overfit by emphasizing minor fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that effective TSAD should focus on modeling "normal" behavior through smooth local patterns. To achieve this, we reformulate time series modeling as approximating the series with smooth univariate functions. The local smoothness of each univariate function ensures that the fitted time series remains resilient against local disturbances. However, a direct KAN implementation proves susceptible to these disturbances due to the inherently localized characteristics of B-spline functions. We thus propose KAN-AD, replacing B-splines with truncated Fourier expansions and introducing a novel lightweight learning mechanism that emphasizes global patterns while staying robust to local disturbances. On four popular TSAD benchmarks, KAN-AD achieves an average 15% improvement in detection accuracy (with peaks exceeding 27%) over state-of-the-art baselines. Remarkably, it requires fewer than 1,000 trainable parameters, resulting in a 50% faster inference speed compared to the original KAN, demonstrating the approach's efficiency and practical viability.</p></details> | 11 pages, ICML 2025 |
| **[DESIGN: Encrypted GNN Inference via Server-Side Input Graph Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05649v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN (EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy, presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review in Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion-Based Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction under Noisy Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05647v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a challenging inverse problem where missing angular projections lead to incomplete sinograms and severe artifacts in the reconstructed images. While recent learning-based methods have demonstrated effectiveness, most of them assume ideal, noise-free measurements and fail to address the impact of measurement noise. To overcome this limitation, we treat LACT as a sinogram inpainting task and propose a diffusion-based framework that completes missing angular views using a Mean-Reverting Stochastic Differential Equation (MR-SDE) formulation. To improve robustness under realistic noise, we propose RNSD$^+$, a novel noise-aware rectification mechanism that explicitly models inference-time uncertainty, enabling reliable and robust reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses baseline models in data consistency and perceptual quality, and generalizes well across varying noise intensity and acquisition scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), Workshop</p></details> |
| **[A Physics-Based Continuum Model for Versatile, Scalable, and Fast Terramechanics Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05643v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses Chrono's Continuous Representation Model (called herein Chrono::CRM), a general-purpose, scalable, and efficient simulation solution for terramechanics problems. Built on Chrono's Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework, Chrono::CRM moves beyond semi-empirical terramechanics approaches, e.g., Bekker-Wong/Janosi-Hanamoto, to provide a physics-based model able to address complex tasks such as digging, grading, as well as interaction with deformable wheels and complex grouser/lug patterns. The terramechanics model is versatile in that it allows the terrain to interact with both rigid and flexible implements simulated via the Chrono dynamics engine. We validate Chrono::CRM against experimental data from three physical tests, including one involving NASA's MGRU3 rover. In addition, the simulator is benchmarked against a high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation of a digging scenario involving the Regolith Advanced Surface Systems Operations Robot (RASSOR). Being GPU-accelerated, Chrono::CRM achieves computational efficiency comparable to that of semi-empirical simulation approaches for terramechanics problems. Through an ``active domains'' implementation, Chrono::CRM can handle terrain stretches up to 10 km long with 100 million SPH particles at near interactive rates, making high-fidelity off-road simulations at large scales feasible. As a component of the Chrono package, the CRM model is open source and released under a BSD-3 license. All models and simulations used in this contribution are available in a public GitHub repository for reproducibility studies and further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 21 figures, Submitted to Journal of Terramechanics</p></details> |

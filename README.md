| **[mRadNet: A Compact Radar Object Detector with MetaFormer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16223v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frequency-modulated continuous wave radars have gained increasing popularity in the automotive industry. Its robustness against adverse weather conditions makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the lightweight design. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026.

| **[VolSplat: Rethinking Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting with Voxel-Aligned Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19297v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat, Code: https://github.com/ziplab/VolSplat</p></details> |
| **[Lyra: Generative 3D Scene Reconstruction via Video Diffusion Model Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19296v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/lyra/</p></details> |
| **[Audio-Based Pedestrian Detection in the Presence of Vehicular Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19295v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-based pedestrian detection is a challenging task and has, thus far, only been explored in noise-limited environments. We present a new dataset, results, and a detailed analysis of the state-of-the-art in audio-based pedestrian detection in the presence of vehicular noise. In our study, we conduct three analyses: (i) cross-dataset evaluation between noisy and noise-limited environments, (ii) an assessment of the impact of noisy data on model performance, highlighting the influence of acoustic context, and (iii) an evaluation of the model's predictive robustness on out-of-domain sounds. The new dataset is a comprehensive 1321-hour roadside dataset. It incorporates traffic-rich soundscapes. Each recording includes 16kHz audio synchronized with frame-level pedestrian annotations and 1fps video thumbnails.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 10th Workshop on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE), 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Preliminary Study on the Robustness of Code Generation by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20197v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness is a critical factor for reliable code generation by large language models, yet most evaluations focus on correctness and overlook key issues such as missing input validation and inadequate error handling. In this work, we present the first empirical study of LLM-generated code robustness using the CoderEval benchmark. Evaluating four state-of-the-art code LLMs, we find that 35.2% of their outputs are less robust than human-written code, with over 90% of deficiencies caused by missing conditional checks-70% of which occur in the first line. Interestingly, in 63% of cases where a conditional statement is needed but absent, the "if" token still ranks among the top three predictions, suggesting implicit recognition of control flow. To address these issues, we propose RobGen, a model-agnostic framework that improves robustness without retraining. RobGen combines a line-level intervention checker, which decides whether to adjust logits for each generated line, with token-level conditional logit adjustments to promote essential control structures. Experiments show that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust code by 10%, achieves the highest average Pass@1 (43.57), and adds minimal overhead (+33.4%). As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively enhances the reliability of LLM-generated code across diverse tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Earth Observation Foundation Model PhilEO: Pretraining on the MajorTOM and FastTOM Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14765v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today, Earth Observation (EO) satellites generate massive volumes of data. To fully exploit this, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this paper, we study scaling-up FMs: we train our models on the pretraining dataset MajorTOM 23TB which includes all regions, and the performance on average is competitive versus models pretrained on more specialized datasets which are substantially smaller and include only land. The additional data of oceans and ice do not decrease the performance on land-focused downstream tasks. These results indicate that large FMs trained on global datasets for a wider variety of downstream tasks can be useful for downstream applications that only require a subset of the information included in their training. The second contribution is the exploration of U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Mamba State-Space Models (SSM) as FMs. U-Net captures local correlations amongst pixels, while ViT and Mamba capture local and distant correlations. We develop various models using different architectures, including U-Net, ViT, and Mamba, and different number of parameters. We evaluate the FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs) needed by the models. We fine-tune on the PhilEO Bench for different downstream tasks: roads, buildings, and land cover. For most n-shots for roads and buildings, U-Net 200M-2T outperforms the other models. Using Mamba, we achieve comparable results on the downstream tasks, with less computational expenses. We also compare with the recent FM TerraMind which we evaluate on PhilEO Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables, 64 references</p></details> |
| **[The information flow among Green Bonds exchange traded funds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19285v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article investigates the information flow between 13 Green Bond ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) from three global markets: the USA, Canada,and Europe, between 2021 and 2022. We used the transfer entropy and effective transfer entropy methods to model and investigate the Green Bond price information flow between these global markets. The American market demonstrated market dominance among the other two markets (Canadian and European). The FLMB Green Bond of the American ETF presented the greatest flow of information transfer among the ETFs analyzed, being considered the dominant ETF among the three Green Bond ETF markets investigated. The HGGB ETF has emerged as a major information transmitter in Europe and in the Canadian market, but it has had a strong influence from the American ETF FLMB. In the European market, the FLRG and GRON.MI bonds played a major role in the flow of information sent to other ETFs in Europe. The KLMH.F in Europe is highlighted as the largest receiver of information. Thus, through this article, it was possible to understand the direction of the flow of information between the Green Bond ETF markets and their dimensionality.</p></details> | 27 pages,13 figures |
| **[OverLayBench: A Benchmark for Layout-to-Image Generation with Dense Overlaps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19282v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2) overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging scenarios.

We propose leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models for this task through a new training-free approach, termed Diffusion-regularized Wasserstein Gradient Flow (DWGF). Specifically, we formulate the posterior sampling problem as a regularized Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in the latent space. We demonstrate the performance of our method on standard benchmarks using StableDiffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) as the prior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2nd Workshop on Frontiers in Probabilistic Inference: Sampling Meets Learning, 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[DRISHTIKON: A Multimodal Multilingual Benchmark for Testing Language Models' Understanding on Indian Culture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19274v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The dataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines, art forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models, proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models, across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded, multimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented traditions. DRISHTIKON fills a vital gap in inclusive AI research, offering a robust testbed to advance culturally aware, multimodally competent language technologies.</p></details> | EMNLP MAINS 2025 |

Inspired by work in marketing, we attempt to break down visual advertisement creativity into atypicality and originality. With fine-grained human annotations on these dimensions, we propose a suite of tasks specifically for such a subjective problem. We also evaluate the alignment between state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision language models (VLMs) and humans on our proposed benchmark, demonstrating both the promises and challenges of using VLMs for automatic creativity assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in EMNLP2025</p></details> |
| **[WolBanking77: Wolof Banking Speech Intent Classification Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19271v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years. However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets, which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written. This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\% of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset (WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77 currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4 hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77 dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Latent Representation Learning of Multi-scale Thermophysics: Application to Dynamics in Shocked Porous Energetic Material](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12996v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 19 figures, complementary results added, restructured Introduction section</p></details> |
| **[The Bayesian Separation Principle for Data-driven Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16717v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we investigate the existence of a separation principle between model identification and control design in the context of model predictive control. First, we clarify that such a separation principle holds asymptotically in the number of data in a Fisherian context, and show that it holds universally, i.e. regardless of the data size, in a Bayesian context. Then, by formulating model predictive control within a Gaussian regression framework, we describe how the Bayesian separation principle can be used to derive computable, uncertainty-aware expressions for the control cost and optimal input sequence, thereby bridging direct and indirect data-driven approaches. Numerical results in both linear and nonlinear scenarios illustrate that the proposed approach outperform nominal methods that neglect uncertainty, highlighting the advantages of incorporating uncertainty in the control design process.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Exploring Model Kinship for Merging Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12613v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution.

| **[Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from the Arab World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19265v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 - Findings</p></details> |
| **[LightThinker: Thinking Step-by-Step Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15589v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance. Code is released at https://github.com/zjunlp/LightThinker.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 (oral) |

New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information in Safe RL. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer (PIGDreamer), a model-based RL approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that PIGDreamer significantly outperforms existing Safe RL methods. Furthermore, compared to alternative privileged RL methods, our approach exhibits enhanced performance, robustness, and efficiency.

| **[Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19249v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.</p></details> | Work in progress |

While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they often fail to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that rely on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we find that current layer-localized KE approaches (e.g., MEMIT, WISE), which edit only single or a few model layers, inadequately integrate updated knowledge into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we present CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enhances the effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. By only leveraging a few curated data samples guided by our circuit-based analysis, CaKE stimulates the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly incorporated knowledge. Experiments show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of edited knowledge across related reasoning tasks, achieving an average improvement of 20% in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on the MQuAKE dataset while requiring less memory than existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

Videos may appear similar when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains. Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating video similarity.

Unlike existing multimodal diffsion language models such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O exhibits many new capabilities such as object grounding, image-editing, and high-resolution (1024px) image synthesis. It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection.

To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.</p></details> | Work in progress |

A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method.

Maintaining grid stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the corresponding Github page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML PKDD ML4SPS 2025 workshop</p></details> |

The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Although routinely collected, these signatures are not measured with exact precision because the sampling mechanism involves examination of small tissue cores from a larger section of interest. We model these error-prone biomarkers as Poisson processes with latent rates, inducing heteroscedasticity in their conditional variance. While critical for tumor histology, such measurement error frameworks remain understudied for conditionally Poisson-distributed covariates. To address this, we propose a Bayesian joint model that incorporates a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture to flexibly characterize the latent covariate distribution. The proposed approach is evaluated using simulation studies which demonstrate a superior bias reduction and robustness to the underlying model in realistic settings when compared to existing methods. We further incorporate Bayes factors for hypothesis testing in the Bayesian semiparametric joint model. The methodology is applied to a survival study of high-grade serous carcinoma where comparisons are made between the proposed and existing approaches.

Recently, mechanistic interpretability has attracted significant attention from the research community as a means to understand the inner workings of LLMs. Among various mechanistic interpretability approaches, Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising method due to their ability to disentangle the complex, superimposed features within LLMs into more interpretable components. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of SAEs for interpreting and understanding the internal workings of LLMs. Our major contributions include: (1) exploring the technical framework of SAEs, covering basic architecture, design improvements, and effective training strategies; (2) examining different approaches to explaining SAE features, categorized into input-based and output-based explanation methods; (3) discussing evaluation methods for assessing SAE performance, covering both structural and functional metrics; and (4) investigating real-world applications of SAEs in understanding and manipulating LLM behaviors.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Yet these systems come with significant computational costs, and their energy demands remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the latency and energy consumption of state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. We first develop a compute-bound analytical model that predicts scaling laws with respect to spatial resolution, temporal length, and denoising steps. We then validate these predictions through fine-grained experiments on WAN2.1-T2V, showing quadratic growth with spatial and temporal dimensions, and linear scaling with the number of denoising steps. Finally, we extend our analysis to six diverse T2V models, comparing their runtime and energy profiles under default settings. Our results provide both a benchmark reference and practical insights for designing and deploying more sustainable generative video systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

However, conventional approaches to analyzing SAEs typically rely solely on input-side activations, without considering the causal influence between each latent feature and the model's output. This work is built on two key hypotheses: (1) activated latents do not contribute equally to the construction of the model's output, and (2) only latents with high causal influence are effective for model steering. To validate these hypotheses, we propose Gradient Sparse Autoencoder (GradSAE), a simple yet effective method that identifies the most influential latents by incorporating output-side gradient information.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Main |

The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Neurips 2025 AI4Science Workshop</p></details> |

To address this, we present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus, were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation, achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in hydrocephalus assessments.

However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and textual representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

We propose two novel methods: the conformal convolution T-learner (CCT) and the conformal Monte Carlo (CMC) meta-learner, that generate full predictive distributions of both potential outcomes and ITEs. Our approaches combine weighted conformal predictive systems with either analytic convolution of potential outcome distributions or Monte Carlo sampling, addressing covariate shift through propensity score weighting. In contrast to other approaches that allow the generation of potential outcome predictive distributions, our approaches are model agnostic, universal, and come with finite-sample guarantees of probabilistic calibration under knowledge of the propensity score. Regarding estimating the ITE distribution, we formally characterize how assumptions about potential outcomes' noise dependency impact distribution validity and establish universal consistency under independence noise assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve probabilistically calibrated predictive distributions while maintaining narrow prediction intervals and having performant continuous ranked probability scores. Besides probabilistic forecasting performance, we observe significant efficiency gains for the CCT- and CMC meta-learners compared to other conformal approaches that produce prediction intervals for ITE with coverage guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major update (rescope to distributional regression in counterfactual inference)</p></details> |

Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>A lig...</summary><p>A lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context</p></details> |

To fully exploit this, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this paper, we study scaling-up FMs: we train our models on the pretraining dataset MajorTOM 23TB which includes all regions, and the performance on average is competitive versus models pretrained on more specialized datasets which are substantially smaller and include only land. The additional data of oceans and ice do not decrease the performance on land-focused downstream tasks. These results indicate that large FMs trained on global datasets for a wider variety of downstream tasks can be useful for downstream applications that only require a subset of the information included in their training. The second contribution is the exploration of U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Mamba State-Space Models (SSM) as FMs. U-Net captures local correlations amongst pixels, while ViT and Mamba capture local and distant correlations. We develop various models using different architectures, including U-Net, ViT, and Mamba, and different number of parameters. We evaluate the FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs) needed by the models. We fine-tune on the PhilEO Bench for different downstream tasks: roads, buildings, and land cover. For most n-shots for roads and buildings, U-Net 200M-2T outperforms the other models. Using Mamba, we achieve comparable results on the downstream tasks, with less computational expenses. We also compare with the recent FM TerraMind which we evaluate on PhilEO Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables, 64 references</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance.

New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on Earth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Neurips 2025 AI4Science Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19199v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Topological Feature Compression for Molecular Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07807v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in molecular representation learning have produced highly effective encodings of molecules for numerous cheminformatics and bioinformatics tasks. However, extracting general chemical insight while balancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture that combines compressed higher-order topological signals with standard molecular features. Our approach captures global geometric information while preserving computational tractability and human-interpretable structure. We evaluate our model across a range of benchmarks, from small-molecule datasets to complex material datasets, and demonstrate superior performance using a parameter-efficient architecture. We achieve the best performing results in both accuracy and robustness across almost all benchmarks. We open source all code \footnote{All code and results can be found on Github https://github.com/rahulkhorana/TFC-PACT-Net}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Thirty-ninth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025 AI4Science Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Saturation-Aware Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Theory and Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11869v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) uses coded masks to compress a 3D data cube into a single 2D snapshot. In practice, multiplexing can push intensities beyond the sensor's dynamic range, producing saturation that violates the linear SCI model and degrades reconstruction. This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of SCI recovery under saturation. We model clipping as an element-wise nonlinearity and derive a finite-sample recovery bound for compression-based SCI that links reconstruction error to mask density and the extent of saturation. The analysis yields a clear design rule: optimal Bernoulli masks use densities below one-half, decreasing further as saturation strengthens. Guided by this principle, we optimize mask patterns and introduce a novel reconstruction framework, Saturation-Aware PnP Net (SAPnet), which explicitly enforces consistency with saturated measurements. Experiments on standard video-SCI benchmarks confirm our theory and demonstrate that SAPnet significantly outperforms existing PnP-based methods.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[SupertonicTTS: Towards Highly Efficient and Streamlined Text-to-Speech System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23108v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SupertonicTTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system designed for efficient and streamlined speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. The TTS pipeline is further simplified by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we propose context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment with minimal memory and I/O overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS delivers performance comparable to contemporary zero-shot TTS models with only 44M parameters, while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational cost.

| **[Circuit Complexity From Physical Constraints: Scaling Limitations of Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19161v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that the standard circuit complexity measures derived from $NC, AC, TC$ provide limited practical information and are now insufficient to further differentiate model expressivity. To address these new limitations, we define a novel notion of local uniformity and a family of circuit complexity classes $RC(\cdot)$ that capture the fundamental constraints of scaling physical circuits. Through the lens of $RC(\cdot)$, we show that attention mechanisms with $\omega(n^{3/2})$ runtime cannot scale to accommodate the entropy of increasingly complex datasets. Our results simultaneously provide a methodology for defining meaningful bounds on transformer expressivity and naturally expose the restricted viability of attention.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[NeuCODEX: Edge-Cloud Co-Inference with Spike-Driven Compression and Dynamic Early-Exit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19156v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16 backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at ICMLA 2025.

| **[Entropy conservative discretization of compressible Euler equations with an arbitrary equation of state](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01235v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a novel spatial discretization procedure for the compressible Euler equations which guarantees entropy conservation at a discrete level when an arbitrary equation of state is assumed. The proposed method, based on a locally-conservative discretization, guarantees also the spatial conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy and is kinetic energy-preserving. In order to achieve the entropy-conservation property for an arbitrary non-ideal gas, a general strategy is adopted based on the manipulation of discrete balance equations through the imposition of global entropy conservation and the use of a summation by parts rule. The procedure, which is extended to an arbitrary order of accuracy, conducts to a general form of the internal-energy numerical flux which results in a nonlinear function of thermodynamic and dynamic variables and still admits the mass flux as a residual degree of freedom. The effectiveness of the novel entropy-conservative formulation is demonstrated through numerical tests making use of some of the most popular cubic equations of state.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Interpretable and Efficient Attention: Compressing All by Contracting a Few](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16875v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks.

| **[BiGraspFormer: End-to-End Bimanual Grasp Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19142v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual grasping is essential for robots to handle large and complex objects. However, existing methods either focus solely on single-arm grasping or employ separate grasp generation and bimanual evaluation stages, leading to coordination problems including collision risks and unbalanced force distribution. To address these limitations, we propose BiGraspFormer, a unified end-to-end transformer framework that directly generates coordinated bimanual grasps from object point clouds. Our key idea is the Single-Guided Bimanual (SGB) strategy, which first generates diverse single grasp candidates using a transformer decoder, then leverages their learned features through specialized attention mechanisms to jointly predict bimanual poses and quality scores. This conditioning strategy reduces the complexity of the 12-DoF search space while ensuring coordinated bimanual manipulation. Comprehensive simulation experiments and real-world validation demonstrate that BiGraspFormer consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining efficient inference speed (<0.05s), confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

| **[Bilateral Distribution Compression: Reducing Both Data Size and Dimensionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17543v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing distribution compression methods reduce dataset size by minimising the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between original and compressed sets, but modern datasets are often large in both sample size and dimensionality. We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.</p></details> | 43 pages, 20 figures |

These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-LLM fusion Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We open-source the codes, models and datasets we constructed: github.com/sony/DeepResonance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeuRIPS2025 Workshop on Structured Probabilistic Inference and Generative Modeling</p></details> |

Comprising 1,499 news articles from the 24.KG news portal, the dataset contains 10,900 sentences and 39,075 entity mentions across 27 named entity classes. We show our annotation scheme, discuss the challenges encountered in the annotation process, and present the descriptive statistics. We also evaluate several named entity recognition models, including traditional sequence labeling approaches based on conditional random fields and state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models fine-tuned on our dataset. While all models show difficulties with rare entity categories, models such as the multilingual RoBERTa variant pretrained on a large corpus across many languages achieve a promising balance between precision and recall. These findings emphasize both the challenges and opportunities of using multilingual pretrained models for processing languages with limited resources. Although the multilingual RoBERTa model performed best, other multilingual models yielded comparable results. This suggests that future work exploring more granular annotation schemes may offer deeper insights for Kyrgyz language processing pipelines evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TurkLang-2025 conference, DOI and copyright will be added upon confirmation of acceptance to publication in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |
| **[Fast and memory-efficient BWT construction of repetitive texts using Lyndon grammars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19123v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) serves as the basis for many important sequence indexes. On very large datasets (e.g. genomic databases), classical BWT construction algorithms are often infeasible because they usually need to have the entire dataset in main memory. Fortunately, such large datasets are often highly repetitive. It can thus be beneficial to compute the BWT from a compressed representation. We propose an algorithm for computing the BWT via the Lyndon straight-line program, a grammar based on the standard factorization of Lyndon words. Our algorithm can also be used to compute the extended BWT (eBWT) of a multiset of sequences. We empirically evaluate our implementation and find that we can compute the BWT and eBWT of very large datasets faster and/or with less memory than competing methods.</p></details> | Accepted to ESA 2025 |
| **[Finite-difference compatible entropy-conserving schemes for the compressible Euler equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16621v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a family of entropy-conserving finite-difference discretizations for the compressible flow equations. In addition to conserving the primary quantities of mass, momentum, and total energy, the methods also preserve kinetic energy and pressure equilibrium. The schemes are based on finite-difference (FD) representations of the logarithmic mean, establishing and leveraging a broader link between linear and nonlinear two-point averages and FD forms. The schemes are locally conservative due to the summation-by-parts property and therefore admit a local flux form, making them applicable also in finite-volume and finite-element settings. The effectiveness of these schemes is validated through various test cases (1D Sod shock tube, 1D density wave, 2D isentropic vortex, 3D Taylor-Green vortex) that demonstrate exact conservation of entropy along with conservation of the primary quantities and preservation of pressure equilibrium.</p></details> | 37 pages, 13 figures |
| **[ManipForce: Force-Guided Policy Learning with Frequency-Aware Representation for Contact-Rich Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19047v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-rich manipulation tasks such as precision assembly require precise control of interaction forces, yet existing imitation learning methods rely mainly on vision-only demonstrations. We propose ManipForce, a handheld system designed to capture high-frequency force-torque (F/T) and RGB data during natural human demonstrations for contact-rich manipulation. Building on these demonstrations, we introduce the Frequency-Aware Multimodal Transformer (FMT). FMT encodes asynchronous RGB and F/T signals using frequency- and modality-aware embeddings and fuses them via bi-directional cross-attention within a transformer diffusion policy. Through extensive experiments on six real-world contact-rich manipulation tasks - such as gear assembly, box flipping, and battery insertion - FMT trained on ManipForce demonstrations achieves robust performance with an average success rate of 83% across all tasks, substantially outperforming RGB-only baselines. Ablation and sampling-frequency analyses further confirm that incorporating high-frequency F/T data and cross-modal integration improves policy performance, especially in tasks demanding high precision and stable contact.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |

Existing approaches often depend on impractical unbiased gradient assumptions or incur sample-size memory overhead. This paper introduces Clapping, a Communication compression algorithm with LAzy samPling for Pipeline-parallel learnING. Clapping adopts a lazy sampling strategy that reuses data samples across steps, breaking sample-wise memory barrier and supporting convergence in few-epoch or online training regimes. Clapping comprises two variants including Clapping-FC and Clapping-FU, both of which achieve convergence without unbiased gradient assumption, effectively addressing compression error propagation in multi-worker settings. Numerical experiments validate the performance of Clapping across different learning tasks.</p></details> | 60 pages |

Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 20th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization</p></details> |

However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis.

This bound has many interesting properties such as transforming appropriately under affine distance transformations and is notably tight for various families of traveling salesman problems with arbitrarily many cities. It is also computed for some real world traveling salesman problems. The eigenvalues in the bound are further related to the Schoenberg criterion from Euclidean geometry. Graph theoretic applications to the Hamiltonian cycle and path problems are given by the fact that the new bound entails necessary graph eigenvalue conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian or traceable. Various non-trivial families of Cayley graphs saturate these Hamiltonicity conditions, thus in a sense providing almost counterexamples to the famous conjecture that all Cayley graphs are Hamiltonian.</p></details> | 21 pages, 2 figures |
| **[One-shot Embroidery Customization via Contrastive LoRA Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18948v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques, and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties, which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation. Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer, we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and appearance transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), SIGGRAPH Asia 2025</p></details> |

Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) 2025</p></details> |

While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VCIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, we posit that these methods excessively relax their inherent low-rank, nonnegative, doubly stochastic, and orthonormal constraints to ensure numerical feasibility, potentially limiting their clustering efficacy. In this paper, guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose \textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{D}oubly stochastic clustering (\textbf{LoRD}), a model that only relaxes the orthonormal constraint to derive a probabilistic clustering results. Furthermore, we theoretically establish the equivalence between orthogonality and block diagonality under the doubly stochastic constraint. By integrating \textbf{B}lock diagonal regularization into LoRD, expressed as the maximization of the Frobenius norm, we propose \textbf{B-LoRD}, which further enhances the clustering performance. To ensure numerical solvability, we transform the non-convex doubly stochastic constraint into a linear convex constraint through the introduction of a class probability parameter. We further theoretically demonstrate the gradient Lipschitz continuity of our LoRD and B-LoRD enables the proposal of a globally convergent projected gradient descent algorithm for their optimization. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approaches. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lwl-learning/LoRD.</p></details> | 39 pages, 20 figures |

This bias hinders their ability to fully utilize acoustic cues, causing suboptimal performance on audio reasoning tasks. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{MATA}, a novel training-free method that dynamically pushes LALMs to pay \textbf{M}ore \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{T}o \textbf{A}udio tokens within the self-attention mechanism. Specifically, MATA intervenes post raw attention scoring, targeting only the last token in intermediate layers without introducing additional parameters or computational overhead. Experiments on the MMAU and MMAR benchmarks confirm MATA's effectiveness, with consistent performance gains. Notably, on MMAR, MATA enables an open-source model to surpass the proprietary Gemini 2.0 Flash for the first time. Our work provides an efficient solution to mitigate attention bias and opens a new research direction for enhancing the audio-processing capabilities of multi-modal models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Exploring time-varying data is critical for data science practitioners aiming to understand dynamic behaviors and discover periodic patterns and trends. However, the analysis of such data often requires sophisticated procedures and tools. Information visualization is a communication channel that leverages human perceptual abilities to transform abstract data into visual representations. Visualization techniques have been successfully applied in the context of time series to enhance interpretability by graphically representing the temporal evolution of data. The challenge for information visualization developers lies in integrating a wide range of analytical tools into rich visualization systems that can summarize complex datasets while clearly describing the impacts of the temporal component. Such systems enable data scientists to turn raw data into understandable and potentially useful knowledge. This review examines techniques and approaches designed for handling time series data, guiding users through knowledge discovery processes based on visual analysis. We also provide readers with theoretical insights and design guidelines for considering when developing comprehensive information visualization approaches for time series, with a particular focus on time series with multiple features. As a result, we highlight the challenges and future research directions to address open questions in the visualization of time-dependent data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

We investigate whether tokens can be more effectively represented through a compositional structure that accumulates diverse semantic facets. To explore this, we propose Aggregate Semantic Grouping (ASG), a novel approach leveraging Product Quantization (PQ). We apply ASG to standard transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-R, mT5) and evaluate this representational scheme across diverse tasks (NLI, NER, QA), as well as a biomedical domain-specific benchmark (BC5CDR) using BioBERT. Our findings demonstrate that representing tokens compositionally via ASG achieves extreme compression in embedding parameters (0.4--0.5\%) while maintaining $>$95\% task performance relative to the base model, even in generative tasks and extends to both cross lingual transfer and domain-specific settings. These results validate the principle that tokens can be effectively modeled as combinations of shared semantic building blocks. ASG offers a simple yet concrete method for achieving this, showcasing how compositional representations can capture linguistic richness while enabling compact yet semantically rich models.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Findings (Short)</p></details> |

However, leveraging a latent continuous space for reasoning may offer benefits in terms of both efficiency and robustness. Prior implicit CoT methods attempt to bypass language completely by reasoning in continuous space but have consistently underperformed compared to the standard explicit CoT approach. We introduce CODI (Continuous Chain-of-Thought via Self-Distillation), a novel training framework that effectively compresses natural language CoT into continuous space. CODI jointly trains a teacher task (Explicit CoT) and a student task (Implicit CoT), distilling the reasoning ability from language into continuous space by aligning the hidden states of a designated token. Our experiments show that CODI is the first implicit CoT approach to match the performance of explicit CoT on GSM8k at the GPT-2 scale, achieving a 3.1x compression rate and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by 28.2% in accuracy. CODI also demonstrates robustness, generalizable to complex datasets, and interpretability. These results validate that LLMs can reason effectively not only in natural language, but also in a latent continuous space.

While existing approaches mainly focus on policy design, they often neglect the structure and capacity of visual encoders, limiting spatial understanding and generalization. Inspired by biological vision systems, which rely on both visual and proprioceptive cues for robust control, we propose VGGT-DP, a visuomotor policy framework that integrates geometric priors from a pretrained 3D perception model with proprioceptive feedback. We adopt the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as the visual encoder and introduce a proprioception-guided visual learning strategy to align perception with internal robot states, improving spatial grounding and closed-loop control. To reduce inference latency, we design a frame-wise token reuse mechanism that compacts multi-view tokens into an efficient spatial representation. We further apply random token pruning to enhance policy robustness and reduce overfitting. Experiments on challenging MetaWorld tasks show that VGGT-DP significantly outperforms strong baselines such as DP and DP3, particularly in precision-critical and long-horizon scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/lyra/</p></details> |

In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 19 figures, complementary results added, restructured Introduction section</p></details> |

Recent research has increasingly focused on test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We introduce the reward-shifted speculative sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks. Additionally, we introduce the Dependency (Dep) metric to quantify the degree of compression by measuring the reliance on historical tokens during generation. Extensive experiments on four datasets and two models show that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our work provides a new direction for improving the efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance.

New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they often fail to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that rely on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we find that current layer-localized KE approaches (e.g., MEMIT, WISE), which edit only single or a few model layers, inadequately integrate updated knowledge into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we present CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enhances the effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. By only leveraging a few curated data samples guided by our circuit-based analysis, CaKE stimulates the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly incorporated knowledge. Experiments show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of edited knowledge across related reasoning tasks, achieving an average improvement of 20% in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on the MQuAKE dataset while requiring less memory than existing KE methods.

Unlike existing multimodal diffsion language models such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O exhibits many new capabilities such as object grounding, image-editing, and high-resolution (1024px) image synthesis. It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection.

Maintaining grid stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g., Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the corresponding Github page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECML PKDD ML4SPS 2025 workshop</p></details> |

However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and textual representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

We propose two novel methods: the conformal convolution T-learner (CCT) and the conformal Monte Carlo (CMC) meta-learner, that generate full predictive distributions of both potential outcomes and ITEs. Our approaches combine weighted conformal predictive systems with either analytic convolution of potential outcome distributions or Monte Carlo sampling, addressing covariate shift through propensity score weighting. In contrast to other approaches that allow the generation of potential outcome predictive distributions, our approaches are model agnostic, universal, and come with finite-sample guarantees of probabilistic calibration under knowledge of the propensity score. Regarding estimating the ITE distribution, we formally characterize how assumptions about potential outcomes' noise dependency impact distribution validity and establish universal consistency under independence noise assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve probabilistically calibrated predictive distributions while maintaining narrow prediction intervals and having performant continuous ranked probability scores. Besides probabilistic forecasting performance, we observe significant efficiency gains for the CCT- and CMC meta-learners compared to other conformal approaches that produce prediction intervals for ITE with coverage guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Major...</summary><p>Major update (rescope to distributional regression in counterfactual inference)</p></details> |

However, performing full SNN inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16 backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted at ICMLA 2025.

However, existing methods either focus solely on single-arm grasping or employ separate grasp generation and bimanual evaluation stages, leading to coordination problems including collision risks and unbalanced force distribution. To address these limitations, we propose BiGraspFormer, a unified end-to-end transformer framework that directly generates coordinated bimanual grasps from object point clouds. Our key idea is the Single-Guided Bimanual (SGB) strategy, which first generates diverse single grasp candidates using a transformer decoder, then leverages their learned features through specialized attention mechanisms to jointly predict bimanual poses and quality scores. This conditioning strategy reduces the complexity of the 12-DoF search space while ensuring coordinated bimanual manipulation. Comprehensive simulation experiments and real-world validation demonstrate that BiGraspFormer consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining efficient inference speed (<0.05s), confirming the effectiveness of our framework.

On very large datasets (e.g. genomic databases), classical BWT construction algorithms are often infeasible because they usually need to have the entire dataset in main memory. Fortunately, such large datasets are often highly repetitive. It can thus be beneficial to compute the BWT from a compressed representation. We propose an algorithm for computing the BWT via the Lyndon straight-line program, a grammar based on the standard factorization of Lyndon words. Our algorithm can also be used to compute the extended BWT (eBWT) of a multiset of sequences. We empirically evaluate our implementation and find that we can compute the BWT and eBWT of very large datasets faster and/or with less memory than competing methods.</p></details> | Accepted to ESA 2025 |

However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spectral Signature Mapping from RGB Imagery for Terrain-Aware Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19105v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful navigation in outdoor environments requires accurate prediction of the physical interactions between the robot and the terrain. To this end, several methods rely on geometric or semantic labels to classify traversable surfaces. However, such labels cannot distinguish visually similar surfaces that differ in material properties. Spectral sensors enable inference of material composition from surface reflectance measured across multiple wavelength bands. Although spectral sensing is gaining traction in robotics, widespread deployment remains constrained by the need for custom hardware integration, high sensor costs, and compute-intensive processing pipelines. In this paper, we present RGB Image to Spectral Signature Neural Network (RS-Net), a deep neural network designed to bridge the gap between the accessibility of RGB sensing and the rich material information provided by spectral data. RS-Net predicts spectral signatures from RGB patches, which we map to terrain labels and friction coefficients. The resulting terrain classifications are integrated into a sampling-based motion planner for a wheeled robot operating in outdoor environments. Likewise, the friction estimates are incorporated into a contact-force-based MPC for a quadruped robot navigating slippery surfaces. Thus, we introduce a framework that learns the task-relevant physical property once during training and thereafter relies solely on RGB sensing at test time.

Existing attempts typically employ reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex multimodal reasoning.

However, the precision control of TTS inference is still challenging. Although instruction-based Text-to-Speech (Instruct-TTS) models are proposed, these models still lack fine-grained control due to the modality gap between single-level text instructions and multilevel speech tokens. To address this limitation, we propose HD-PPT, a framework that transforms speech synthesis into a structured, hierarchical task. To enable fine-grained control, we introduce a novel speech codec to extract distinct prompt-preference and content-preference tokens from the complex speech tokens, supervised by automatic speech recognition (ASR) and cross-lingual audio-text pre-training (CLAP) objectives. To bridge the modality gap of these tokens, we propose a hierarchical decoding strategy, where the LLM generates tokens in a structured order: first semantic, then fine-grained style, and finally complete acoustic representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this hierarchical paradigm significantly improves instruction adherence and achieves state-of-the-art naturalness, validating our approach for precise and controllable speech synthesis.

| **[Towards Privacy-Aware Bayesian Networks: A Credal Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18949v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that enable efficient knowledge representation and inference. These have proven effective across diverse domains, including healthcare, bioinformatics and economics. The structure and parameters of a BN can be obtained by domain experts or directly learned from available data. However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes increasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive information in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize privacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine the released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals belong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection tecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this offers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the model's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the resulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of releasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks (CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After adapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the masking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful attacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve meaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy. Moreover, we identify key learning information that must be concealed to prevent attackers from recovering the underlying BN. Finally, we conduct a set of numerical experiments to analyze how privacy gains can be modulated by tuning the CN hyperparameters. Our results confirm that CNs provide a principled, practical, and effective approach towards the development of privacy-aware probabilistic graphical models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECAI2025 conference, 20 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

Beyond artistic style transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties, which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation. Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer, we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and appearance transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), SIGGRAPH Asia 2025</p></details> |

We utilize Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIMs) to control wireless propagation, enabling the channel itself to perform over-the-air computation. This eliminates the need for symbol estimation at the receiver, significantly reducing computational and communication overhead. Our approach models the transmitter-channel-receiver system as an end-to-end Deep Neural Network (DNN) where the response of the SIM elements are trainable parameters. To address channel variability, we incorporate a dedicated DNN module responsible for dynamically adjusting transmission power leveraging user location information. Our performance evaluations showcase that the proposed metasurfaces-integrated DNN framework with deep SIM architectures are capable of balancing classification accuracy and power consumption under diverse scenarios, offering significant energy efficiency improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

For this, existing methods rely on resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training, we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and synthetic rationales.

However, the scarcity of high-resolution, comprehensive open-source datasets and the difficulty in achieving robust performance across varying change types remain major challenges. To address these issues, we introduce JL1-CD, a large-scale, sub-meter CD dataset consisting of 5,000 image pairs. We further propose a novel Origin-Partition (O-P) strategy and integrate it into a Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) framework to enhance CD performance. The O-P strategy partitions the training set by Change Area Ratio (CAR) and trains specialized teacher models on each subset. The MTKD framework then distills complementary knowledge from these teachers into a single student model, enabling improved detection results across diverse CAR scenarios without additional inference cost. Our MTKD approach demonstrated strong performance in the 2024 ``Jilin-1'' Cup challenge, ranking first in the preliminary and second in the final rounds. Extensive experiments on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets show that the MTKD framework consistently improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

We propose a four-part taxonomy (parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple (location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism, evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval) that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC), and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout, monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 1 figure, 8 tables This is a survey/framework paper on LLM memory mechanisms and evaluation</p></details> |

However, within-label variation--cases where annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for categorizing free-text explanations. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Main, 22 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Extremely memory-efficient model architectures are decisive to fit within an MCU's tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. However, inference latency must remain small to fit real-time constraints. An approach to tackle this is patch-based fusion, which aims to optimize data flows across neural network layers. In this paper, we introduce msf-CNN, a novel technique that efficiently finds optimal fusion settings for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by walking through the fusion solution space represented as a directed acyclic graph. Compared to previous work on CNN fusion for MCUs, msf-CNN identifies a wider set of solutions. We published an implementation of msf-CNN running on various microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32). We show that msf-CNN can achieve inference using 50% less RAM compared to the prior art (MCUNetV2 and StreamNet). We thus demonstrate how msf-CNN offers additional flexibility for system designers.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (poster)</p></details> |

However, hardware limitations of real-world systems constrain to smaller ensembles and lower-capacity networks, significantly deteriorating their performance and properties. We introduce Packed-Ensembles (PE), a strategy to design and train lightweight structured ensembles by carefully modulating the dimension of their encoding space. We leverage grouped convolutions to parallelize the ensemble into a single shared backbone and forward pass to improve training and inference speeds. PE is designed to operate within the memory limits of a standard neural network. Our extensive research indicates that PE accurately preserves the properties of DE, such as diversity, and performs equally well in terms of accuracy, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and robustness to distribution shift.

We show that, when the approximation family is exponential, the best approximation is the solution of a fixed-point equation. We introduce LSVI (Least-Squares Variational Inference), a Monte Carlo variant of the corresponding fixed-point recursion, where each iteration boils down to ordinary least squares regression and does not require computing gradients. We show that LSVI is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent; we use this insight to derive convergence guarantees. We introduce various ideas to improve LSVI further when the approximation family is Gaussian, leading to a $O(d^3)$ complexity in the dimension $d$ of the target in the full-covariance case, and a $O(d)$ complexity in the mean-field case. We show that LSVI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a range of examples, while remaining gradient-free, that is, it does not require computing gradients.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 41 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

Yet existing approaches typically collapse homophily to a single scale, either one parameter for the whole network or one per community, thereby detaching it from other structural features. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy random graph model that moves beyond these limits, capturing homophily across all social scales in the network, with parameters for each group size. The framework decomposes homophily into within- and across-group contributions, recovering the stochastic block model as a special case. As an exponential-family model, it fits empirical data and enables inference of group-level variation of homophily that aggregate metrics miss. The group-dependence of homophily substantially impacts network percolation thresholds, altering predictions for epidemic spread, information diffusion, and the effectiveness of interventions. Ignoring such heterogeneity risks systematically misjudging connectivity and dynamics in complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 Fig...</summary><p>3 Figures, 15 pages, 2 tables</p></details> |

Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative framework that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this predictive task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, additional supplementary text and figures</p></details> |

Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD unified settings without disaggregation. Under the same (default) settings, our method achieves improved performance and faster inference, along with a 4.95$\times$ reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption.</p></details> | 22 pages |

SGG shows significant promise as a foundational component for downstream tasks, such as reasoning for embodied agents.

However, current methods tend to focus on one of the following: (1) improving relation prediction accuracy, (2) enhancing object detection accuracy, or (3) reducing latency, without aiming to balance all three objectives simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose the Real-time Efficiency and Accuracy Compromise for Tradeoffs in Scene Graph Generation (REACT) architecture, which achieves the highest inference speed among existing SGG models, improving object detection accuracy without sacrificing relation prediction performance.

This motivated the development of quantization-aware PEFT to produce accurate yet efficient quantized models. In this setting, reducing quantization error prior to fine-tuning is crucial for achieving high model accuracy. However, existing methods that rely on low-rank adaptation suffer from limited representational capacity. Recent Fourier-related transform (FT)-based adapters offer greater representational power than low-rank adapters, but their direct integration into quantized models often results in ineffective error reduction and increased computational overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose QWHA, a method that integrates FT-based adapters into quantized models by employing the Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) as the transform kernel, together with a novel adapter initialization scheme incorporating adaptive parameter selection and value refinement. We demonstrate that QWHA effectively mitigates quantization errors while facilitating fine-tuning, and that its design substantially reduces computational cost. Experimental results show that QWHA consistently outperforms baselines in low-bit quantization accuracy and achieves significant training speedups over existing FT-based adapters.

However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition).

| **[6G Twin: Hybrid Gaussian Radio Fields for Channel Estimation and Non-Linear Precoder Design for Radio Access Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18735v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces 6G Twin, the first end-to-end artificial intelligence (AI)-native radio access network (RAN) design that unifies (i) neural Gaussian Radio Fields (GRF) for compressed channel state information (CSI) acquisition, (ii) continual channel prediction with handover persistence, and (iii) an energy-optimal nonlinear precoder (minPMAC). GRF replaces dense pilots with a sparse Gaussian field, cutting pilot overhead by about 100x while delivering 1.1 ms inference and less than 2 minutes on-site training, thus enabling millisecond-scale closed-loop operation. A replay-driven continual learner sustains accuracy under mobility and cell transitions, improving channel normalized mean square error (NMSE) by more than 10 dB over frozen predictors and an additional 2-5 dB over uniform replay, thereby stabilizing performance across UMi/UMa handovers. Finally, minPMAC solves a convex, order-free MAC precoder design that recovers the globally optimal order from Broadcast Channel (BC) duals and minimizes transmit energy subject to minimum-rate guarantees, achieving 4-10 times lower energy (scenario dependent) with monotonically increasing bits per joule as SNR grows. This translates to up to 5 times higher data rate at comparable power or the same rates at substantially lower power. Together, these components form a practical, GPU-ready framework that attains real-time CSI, robust tracking in dynamic networks with efficient handovers, and state-of-the-art throughput-energy tradeoffs under 3GPP-style settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[PruneCD: Contrasting Pruned Self Model to Improve Decoding Factuality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16598v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the hallucination problem in large language models, DoLa exploits early exit logits from the same model as a contrastive prior. However, we found that these early exit logits tend to be flat, low in magnitude, and fail to reflect meaningful contrasts. To address this, we propose PruneCD, a novel contrastive decoding method that constructs the amateur model via layer pruning rather than early exit. This design leads to more informative and well-aligned logits, enabling more effective contrastive decoding. Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that PruneCD consistently improves factuality with minimal inference overhead, offering a robust and practical approach to mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Memorization or Reasoning? Exploring the Idiom Understanding of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16216v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Idioms have long posed a challenge due to their unique linguistic properties, which set them apart from other common expressions. While recent studies have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to handle idioms across various tasks, e.g., idiom-containing sentence generation and idiomatic machine translation, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of idiom processing in LLMs, particularly in multilingual settings. To this end, we introduce MIDAS, a new large-scale dataset of idioms in six languages, each paired with its corresponding meaning. Leveraging this resource, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' idiom processing ability, identifying key factors that influence their performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs rely not only on memorization, but also adopt a hybrid approach that integrates contextual cues and reasoning, especially when processing compositional idioms. This implies that idiom understanding in LLMs emerges from an interplay between internal knowledge retrieval and reasoning-based inference.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding.

| **[What Makes You Unique? Attribute Prompt Composition for Object Re-Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18715v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically, we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS) to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization.

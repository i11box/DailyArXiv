| **[Capturing Visualization Design Rationale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16571v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior natural language datasets for data visualization have focused on tasks such as visualization literacy assessment, insight generation, and visualization generation from natural language instructions. These studies often rely on controlled setups with purpose-built visualizations and artificially constructed questions. As a result, they tend to prioritize the interpretation of visualizations, focusing on decoding visualizations rather than understanding their encoding. In this paper, we present a new dataset and methodology for probing visualization design rationale through natural language. We leverage a unique source of real-world visualizations and natural language narratives: literate visualization notebooks created by students as part of a data visualization course. These notebooks combine visual artifacts with design exposition, in which students make explicit the rationale behind their design decisions. We also use large language models (LLMs) to generate and categorize question-answer-rationale triples from the narratives and articulations in the notebooks. We then carefully validate the triples and curate a dataset that captures and distills the visualization design choices and corresponding rationales of the students.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at IEEE VIS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Flow-Modulated Scoring for Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23137v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective modeling of multifaceted relations is pivotal for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC). However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 26 figures, submitted to Journal of Mechanical Design</p></details> |
| **[Defensive Adversarial CAPTCHA: A Semantics-Driven Framework for Natural Adversarial Example Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10685v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) schemes are increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on the original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit their applicability in scenarios where no initial input images are available. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (DAC), a novel framework that generates high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified semantics information. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), DAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and enriches the semantic information. To address various application scenarios, we examine the white-box targeted attack scenario and the black box untargeted attack scenario. For target attacks, we introduce two latent noise variables that are alternately guided in the diffusion step to achieve robust inversion. The synergy between gradient guidance and latent variable optimization achieved in this way ensures that the generated adversarial examples not only accurately align with the target conditions but also achieve optimal performance in terms of distributional consistency and attack effectiveness. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-DAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show that the defensive adversarial CAPTCHA generated by BP-DAC is able to defend against most of the unknown models, and the generated CAPTCHA is indistinguishable to both humans and DNNs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Training Free Stylized Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22663v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stylized abstraction synthesizes visually exaggerated yet semantically faithful representations of subjects, balancing recognizability with perceptual distortion. Unlike image-to-image translation, which prioritizes structural fidelity, stylized abstraction demands selective retention of identity cues while embracing stylistic divergence, especially challenging for out-of-distribution individuals. We propose a training-free framework that generates stylized abstractions from a single image using inference-time scaling in vision-language models (VLLMs) to extract identity-relevant features, and a novel cross-domain rectified flow inversion strategy that reconstructs structure based on style-dependent priors. Our method adapts structural restoration dynamically through style-aware temporal scheduling, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions that honor both subject and style. It supports multi-round abstraction-aware generation without fine-tuning. To evaluate this task, we introduce StyleBench, a GPT-based human-aligned metric suited for abstract styles where pixel-level similarity fails. Experiments across diverse abstraction (e.g., LEGO, knitted dolls, South Park) show strong generalization to unseen identities and styles in a fully open-source setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kartik-3004.github.io/TF-SA/</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting mean estimation over $\ell_p$ balls: Is the MLE optimal?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10354v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the problem of mean estimation in the Gaussian sequence model with $\ell_p$ constraints for $p \in [0, \infty]$. We demonstrate two phenomena for the behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which depend on the noise level, the radius of the (quasi)norm constraint, the dimension, and the norm index $p$. First, if $p$ lies between $0$ and $1 + \Theta(\tfrac{1}{\log d})$, inclusive, or if it is greater than or equal to $2$, the MLE is minimax rate-optimal for all noise levels and all constraint radii. On the other hand, for the remaining norm indices -- namely, if $p$ lies between $1 + \Theta(\tfrac{1}{\log d})$ and $2$ -- here is a more striking behavior: the MLE is minimax rate-suboptimal, despite its nonlinearity in the observations, for essentially all noise levels and constraint radii for which nonlinear estimates are necessary for minimax-optimal estimation. Our results imply that when given $n$ independent and identically distributed Gaussian samples, the MLE can be suboptimal by a polynomial factor in the sample size. Our lower bounds are constructive: whenever the MLE is rate-suboptimal, we provide explicit instances on which the MLE provably incurs suboptimal risk. Finally, in the non-convex case -- namely when $p < 1$ -- we develop sharp local Gaussian width bounds, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 43 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Meta-Posterior Consistency for the Bayesian Inference of Metastable System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01868v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast majority of the literature on learning dynamical systems or stochastic processes from time series has focused on stable or ergodic systems, for both Bayesian and frequentist inference procedures. However, most real-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be stable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales. Consistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one can ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when observations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on longer time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify metaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be exploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system, where inference on the global behavior may require much more data, or there is no theoretical guarantee as to the asymptotic success of inference procedures. We also discuss the relation between metaconsistency and the spectral properties of the model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic and non-ergodic diffusions.</p></details> | 32 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Source-Channel Separation Theorems for Distortion Perception Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17706v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that separation between lossy source coding and channel coding is asymptotically optimal under classical additive distortion measures. Recently, coding under a new class of quality considerations, often referred to as perception or realism, has attracted significant attention due to its close connection to neural generative models and semantic communications. In this work, we revisit source-channel separation under the consideration of distortion-perception. We show that when the perception quality is measured on the block level, i.e., in the strong-sense, the optimality of separation still holds when common randomness is shared between the encoder and the decoder; however, separation is no longer optimal when such common randomness is not available. In contrast, when the perception quality is the average per-symbol measure, i.e., in the weak-sense, the optimality of separation holds regardless of the availability of common randomness.</p></details> | 1 figure, 6 pages |
| **[Large Language Model Confidence Estimation via Black-Box Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04370v4)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b, Mistral-7b and GPT-4 on four benchmark Q\&A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Nonparametric causal inference for optogenetics: sequential excursion effects for dynamic regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18597v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optogenetics is a powerful neuroscience technique for studying how neural circuit manipulation affects behavior. Standard analysis conventions discard information and severely limit the scope of the causal questions that can be probed. To address this gap, we 1) draw connections to the causal inference literature on sequentially randomized experiments, 2) propose a non-parametric framework for analyzing "open-loop" (static regime) optogenetics behavioral experiments, 3) derive extensions of history-restricted marginal structural models for dynamic treatment regimes with positivity violations for "closed-loop" designs, and 4) propose a taxonomy of identifiable causal effects that encompass a far richer collection of scientific questions compared to standard methods. From another view, our work extends "excursion effect" methods, popularized recently in the mobile health literature, to enable estimation of causal contrasts for treatment sequences in the presence of positivity violations. We describe sufficient conditions for identifiability of the proposed causal estimands, and provide asymptotic statistical guarantees for a proposed inverse probability-weighted estimator, a multiply-robust estimator (for two intervention timepoints), a framework for hypothesis testing, and a computationally scalable implementation. Finally, we apply our framework to data from a recent neuroscience study and show how it provides insight into causal effects of optogenetics on behavior that are obscured by standard analyses.</p></details> | 62 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Privacy-Preserving LLM Interaction with Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning and Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Databases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17336v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as personal agents, accessing sensitive user data such as calendars, emails, and medical records. Users currently face a trade-off: They can send private records, many of which are stored in remote databases, to powerful but untrusted LLM providers, increasing their exposure risk. Alternatively, they can run less powerful models locally on trusted devices. We bridge this gap. Our Socratic Chain-of-Thought Reasoning first sends a generic, non-private user query to a powerful, untrusted LLM, which generates a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt and detailed sub-queries without accessing user data. Next, we embed these sub-queries and perform encrypted sub-second semantic search using our Homomorphically Encrypted Vector Database across one million entries of a single user's private data. This represents a realistic scale of personal documents, emails, and records accumulated over years of digital activity. Finally, we feed the CoT prompt and the decrypted records to a local language model and generate the final response. On the LoCoMo long-context QA benchmark, our hybrid framework, combining GPT-4o with a local Llama-3.2-1B model, outperforms using GPT-4o alone by up to 7.1 percentage points. This demonstrates a first step toward systems where tasks are decomposed and split between untrusted strong LLMs and weak local ones, preserving user privacy.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

| **[Bayesian estimation of causal effects from observational categorical data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05198v3)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Bayesian procedure for estimation of pairwise intervention effects in a high-dimensional system of categorical variables. We assume that we have observational data generated from an unknown causal Bayesian network for which there are no latent confounders. Most of the existing methods developed for this setting assume that the underlying model is linear Gaussian, including the Bayesian IDA (BIDA) method that we build upon in this work. By combining a Bayesian backdoor estimator with model averaging, we obtain a posterior over the intervention distributions of a cause-effect pair that can be expressed as a mixture over stochastic linear combinations of Dirichlet distributions. Although there is no closed-form expression for the posterior density, it is straightforward to produce Monte Carlo approximations of target quantities through direct sampling, and we also derive closed-form expressions for a few selected moments. To scale up the proposed procedure, we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which also enables us to use more efficient adjustment sets compared to the current exact BIDA. Finally, we use Jensen-Shannon divergence to define a novel causal effect based on a set of intervention distributions in the general categorical setting. We compare our method to the original IDA method and existing Bayesian approaches in numerical simulations and show that categorical BIDA performs favorably against the existing alternative methods in terms of producing point estimates and discovering strong effects.</p></details> | 39 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Lion Secretly Solves Constrained Optimization: As Lyapunov Predicts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05898v7)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program search, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs comparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can expect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements from several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight decay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing category of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears to perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its theoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits opportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy. This work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and discrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and principled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while enforcing a bound constraint $\|x\|_\infty \leq 1/\lambda$. Lion achieves this through the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\lambda$ represents the weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development of a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family of Lion-$\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\text{sign}(\cdot)$ operator in Lion is replaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\kappa$, leading to the solution of a general composite optimization problem of $\min_x f(x) + \kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion and pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related algorithms.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 Spotlight |
| **[Hybrid Explicit-Implicit Predictor-Corrector Exponential Time-Differencing Multistep Padé Schemes for Semilinear Parabolic Equations with Time-Delay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22664v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose and analyze ETD-Multistep-Pad\'{e} (ETD-MS-Pad\'{e}) and ETD Implicit Multistep-Pad\'{e} (ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e}) for semilinear parabolic delay differential equations with smooth solutions. In our previous work [15], we proposed ETD-RK-Pad\'{e} scheme to compute high-order numerical solutions for nonlinear parabolic reaction-diffusion equation with constant time delay. However, the based ETD-RK numerical scheme in [15] is very complex and the corresponding calculation program is also very complicated. We propose in this paper ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} and ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} schemes for the solution of semilinear parabolic equations with delay. We synergize the ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} with ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} to construct efficient predictor-corrector scheme. This new predictor-corrector scheme will become an important tool for solving the numerical solutions of parabolic differential equations. Remarkably, we also conducted experiments in Table$10$ to compare the numerical results of the predictor-corrector scheme with the EERK scheme proposed in paper [42]. The predictor-corrector scheme demonstrated better convergence. The main idea is to employ an ETD-based Adams multistep extrapolation for the time integration of the corresponding equation. To overcome the well-known numerical instability associated with computing the exponential operator, we utilize the Pad\'{e} approach to approximate this exponential operator. This methodology leads to the development of the ETD-MS-Pad\'{e} and ETD-IMS-Pad\'{e} schemes, applicable even for arbitrary time orders. We validate the ETD-MS1,2,3,4-Pad\'{e} schemes and ETD-IMS2,3,4 schemes through numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper requires substantial revisions for clarity and correctness</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Attributed Dynamic Network Embedding with Stability Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02859v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability for dynamic network embeddings ensures that nodes behaving the same at different times receive the same embedding, allowing comparison of nodes in the network across time. We present attributed unfolded adjacency spectral embedding (AUASE), a stable unsupervised representation learning framework for dynamic networks in which nodes are attributed with time-varying covariate information. To establish stability, we prove uniform convergence to an associated latent position model. We quantify the benefits of our dynamic embedding by comparing with state-of-the-art network representation learning methods on four real attributed networks. To the best of our knowledge, AUASE is the only attributed dynamic embedding that satisfies stability guarantees without the need for ground truth labels, which we demonstrate provides significant improvements for link prediction and node classification.</p></details> | 28 pages, 5 figures |
| **[What About Emotions? Guiding Fine-Grained Emotion Extraction from Mobile App Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23452v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Opinion mining plays a vital role in analysing user feedback and extracting insights from textual data. While most research focuses on sentiment polarity (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), fine-grained emotion classification in app reviews remains underexplored. Fine-grained emotion classification is thus needed to better understand users' affective responses and support downstream tasks such as feature-emotion analysis, user-oriented release planning, and issue triaging. This paper addresses this gap by identifying and addressing the challenges and limitations in fine-grained emotion analysis in the context of app reviews. Our study adapts Plutchik's emotion taxonomy to app reviews by developing a structured annotation framework and dataset. Through an iterative human annotation process, we define clear annotation guidelines and document key challenges in emotion classification. Additionally, we evaluate the feasibility of automating emotion annotation using large language models, assessing their cost-effectiveness and agreement with human-labelled data. Our findings reveal that while large language models significantly reduce manual effort and maintain substantial agreement with human annotators, full automation remains challenging due to the complexity of emotional interpretation. This work contributes to opinion mining in requirements engineering by providing structured guidelines, an annotated dataset, and insights for developing automated pipelines to capture the complexity of emotions in app reviews.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning by Superposition: A Theoretical Perspective on Chain of Continuous Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12514v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many applications, including challenging reasoning problems via chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) techniques that generate ``thinking tokens'' before answering the questions. While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$ steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state, which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs, without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths simultaneously.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model (VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization, which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training, particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by enhancing surgical precision and safety.

In this article, we propose a methodology for enabling mixed-precision with the help of computer arithmetic tools, roofline model, and computer arithmetic techniques. As case studies, we consider Nekbone, a mini-application for the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver Nek5000, and a modern Neko CFD application. With the help of the Verificarlo tool and computer arithmetic techniques, we introduce a strategy to address stagnation issues in the preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method in Nekbone and apply these insights to implement a mixed-precision version of Neko. We evaluate the derived mixed-precision versions of these codes by combining metrics in three dimensions: accuracy, time-to-solution, and energy-to-solution. Notably, mixed-precision in Nekbone reduces time-to-solution by roughly 1.62x and energy-to-solution by 2.43x on MareNostrum 5, while in the real-world Neko application, the gain is up to 1.3x in both time and energy, with the accuracy that matches double-precision results.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11065</p></details> |

We propose LUPIN, a Lagrangian Double U-Net for Physics-Informed Nowcasting, that draws from existing extrapolation-based nowcasting methods. It consists of a U-Net that dynamically produces mesoscale advection motion fields, a differentiable semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an advection-free U-Net capturing the growth and decay of precipitation over time. Using our approach, we successfully implement the Lagrangian convolutional neural network for precipitation nowcasting in a fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated manner. This allows for end-to-end training and inference, including the data-driven Lagrangian coordinate system transformation of the data at runtime. We evaluate the model and compare it with other related AI-based models both quantitatively and qualitatively in an extreme event case study. Based on our evaluation, LUPIN matches and even exceeds the performance of the chosen benchmarks, opening the door for other Lagrangian machine learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Applied Computing and Geosciences</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Diagnostic Performance: Revealing and Quantifying Ethical Risks in Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16889v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs), as large-scale pre-trained models tailored for computational pathology, have significantly advanced a wide range of applications. Their ability to leverage prior knowledge from massive datasets has streamlined the development of intelligent pathology models. However, we identify several critical and interrelated ethical risks that remain underexplored, yet must be addressed to enable the safe translation of PFMs from lab to clinic. These include the potential leakage of patient-sensitive attributes, disparities in model performance across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the reliance on diagnosis-irrelevant features that undermine clinical reliability. In this study, we pioneer the quantitative analysis for ethical risks in PFMs, including privacy leakage, clinical reliability, and group fairness. Specifically, we propose an evaluation framework that systematically measures key dimensions of ethical concern: the degree to which patient-sensitive attributes can be inferred from model representations, the extent of performance disparities across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the influence of diagnostically irrelevant features on model decisions. We further investigate the underlying causes of these ethical risks in PFMs and empirically validate our findings. Then we offer insights into potential directions for mitigating such risks, aiming to inform the development of more ethically robust PFMs. This work provides the first quantitative and systematic evaluation of ethical risks in PFMs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for ethical safeguards in PFMs and offer actionable insights for building more trustworthy and clinically robust PFMs. To facilitate future research and deployment, we will release the assessment framework as an online toolkit to support the development, auditing, and deployment of ethically robust PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages,5 figure,23 tables</p></details> |

Accurate organ segmentation from PET images is essential for comprehensive multi-systemic analysis of interactions between different organs and pathologies. Existing segmentation methods are limited by insufficient annotation data and varying levels of annotation, resulting in weak generalization ability and difficulty in clinical application. Recent developments in segmentation foundation models have shown superior versatility across diverse segmentation tasks. Despite the efforts of medical adaptations, these works primarily focus on structural medical images with detailed physiological structural information and exhibit limited generalization performance on molecular PET imaging. In this paper, we collect and construct PETS-5k, the largest PET segmentation dataset to date, comprising 5,731 three-dimensional whole-body PET images and encompassing over 1.3M 2D images. Based on the established dataset, we develop SegAnyPET, a modality-specific 3D foundation model for universal promptable segmentation from PET images. To issue the challenge of discrepant annotation quality, we adopt a cross prompting confident learning (CPCL) strategy with an uncertainty-guided self-rectification process to robustly learn segmentation from high-quality labeled data and low-quality noisy labeled data for promptable segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that SegAnyPET can segment seen and unseen target organs using only one or a few prompt points, outperforming state-of-the-art foundation models and task-specific fully supervised models with higher accuracy and strong generalization ability for universal segmentation.</p></details> | Accept for ICCV 2025 |
| **[Studying and Improving Graph Neural Network-based Motif Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15709v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a predominant method for graph representation learning. However, beyond subgraph frequency estimation, their application to network motif significance-profile (SP) prediction remains under-explored, with no established benchmarks in the literature. We propose to address this problem, framing SP estimation as a task independent of subgraph frequency estimation. Our approach shifts from frequency counting to direct SP estimation and modulates the problem as multitarget regression. The reformulation is optimised for interpretability, stability and scalability on large graphs. We validate our method using a large synthetic dataset and further test it on real-world graphs. Our experiments reveal that 1-WL limited models struggle to make precise estimations of SPs. However, they can generalise to approximate the graph generation processes of networks by comparing their predicted SP with the ones originating from synthetic generators. This first study on GNN-based motif estimation also hints at how using direct SP estimation can help go past the theoretical limitations that motif estimation faces when performed through subgraph counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript represents a revised version from the paper on https://openreview.net/forum?id=PZVVOeu6xx.

| **[Exploring Text-Guided Single Image Editing for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05769v4)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence generative content (AIGC) has significantly impacted image generation in the field of remote sensing. However, the equally important area of remote sensing image (RSI) editing has not received sufficient attention. Deep learning based editing methods generally involve two sequential stages: generation and editing. For natural images, these stages primarily rely on generative backbones pre-trained on large-scale benchmark datasets and text guidance facilitated by vision-language models (VLMs). However, it become less viable for RSIs: First, existing generative RSI benchmark datasets do not fully capture the diversity of RSIs, and is often inadequate for universal editing tasks. Second, the single text semantic corresponds to multiple image semantics, leading to the introduction of incorrect semantics. To solve above problems, this paper proposes a text-guided RSI editing method and can be trained using only a single image. A multi-scale training approach is adopted to preserve consistency without the need for training on extensive benchmarks, while leveraging RSI pre-trained VLMs and prompt ensembling (PE) to ensure accuracy and controllability. Experimental results on multiple RSI editing tasks show that the proposed method offers significant advantages in both CLIP scores and subjective evaluations compared to existing methods. Additionally, we explore the ability of the edited RSIs to support disaster assessment tasks in order to validate their practicality. Codes will be released at https://github.com/HIT-PhilipHan/remote_sensing_image_editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 18 figures, Accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

Despite their promise, the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, particularly those augmented with intermediate thinking traces (MLLMs-T), remain poorly understood and lack standardized evaluation benchmarks. Existing work focuses primarily on perception or final answer correctness, offering limited insight into how models reason or fail across modalities. To address this gap, we introduce the MMMR, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate multi-modal reasoning with explicit thinking. The MMMR comprises 1) a high-difficulty dataset of 1,083 questions spanning six diverse reasoning types with symbolic depth and multi-hop demands and 2) a modular Reasoning Trace Evaluation Pipeline (RTEP) for assessing reasoning quality beyond accuracy through metrics like relevance, consistency, and structured error annotations. Empirical results show that MLLMs-T overall outperform non-thinking counterparts, but even top models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5 Pro suffer from reasoning pathologies such as inconsistency and overthinking. This benchmark reveals persistent gaps between accuracy and reasoning quality and provides an actionable evaluation pipeline for future model development. Overall, the MMMR offers a scalable foundation for evaluating, comparing, and improving the next generation of multi-modal reasoning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA).

| **[EvoPress: Accurate Dynamic Model Compression via Evolutionary Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14649v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high computational costs of large language models (LLMs) have led to a flurry of research on LLM compression, via methods such as quantization, sparsification, or structured pruning. A new frontier in this area is given by dynamic, non-uniform compression methods, which adjust the compression levels (e.g., sparsity) per-block or even per-layer in order to minimize accuracy loss, while guaranteeing a global compression threshold. Yet, current methods rely on estimating the importance of a given layer, implicitly assuming that layers contribute independently to the overall compression error. We begin from the motivating observation that this independence assumption does not generally hold for LLM compression: pruning a model further may even significantly recover performance. To address this, we propose EvoPress, a novel evolutionary framework for dynamic LLM compression. By formulating dynamic compression as a general optimization problem, EvoPress identifies optimal compression profiles in a highly efficient manner, and generalizes across diverse models and compression techniques. Via EvoPress, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for dynamic compression of Llama, Mistral, and Phi models, setting new benchmarks for structural pruning (block/layer dropping), unstructured sparsity, and quantization with dynamic bitwidths.

| **[OM4OV: Leveraging Ontology Matching for Ontology Versioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20302v4)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the dynamic nature of the Semantic Web, version control is necessary to capture time-varying information, particularly for widely used ontologies. Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component for efficient ontology management, the growing size of ontologies and accumulating errors caused by manual labour overwhelm current OV approaches. In this paper, we propose a fresh approach to performing OV using existing ontology matching (OM) techniques and systems. We introduce a unified OM4OV pipeline. From an OM perspective, we reconstruct a new task formulation and measurements for OV tasks. Building upon the prior alignment(s) from OM, we propose a pipeline optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism to enhance overall OV performance. We experimentally validate the OM4OV pipeline and the cross-reference mechanism in an OV testbed originating from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) datasets. We also discuss insights into OM used for OV tasks, where some apparent false mappings detected by OV systems are not actually untrue.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

By introducing a more pessimistic stochastic process, the partially-ordered evolutionary algorithm (PO-EA) model, Jansen first proved a runtime bound of $O(n^{3/2})$. More recently, Lengler, Martinsson and Steger improved this upper bound to $O(n \log^2 n)$ by an entropy compression argument. In this work, we analyze monotone functions that may adversarially vary at each step of the optimization, so-called dynamic monotone functions. We introduce the function Switching Dynamic BinVal (SDBV) and prove, using a combinatorial argument, that for the $(1+1)$-EA with any mutation rate $p \in [0,1]$, SDBV is drift minimizing within the class of dynamic monotone functions. We further show that the $(1+1)$-EA optimizes SDBV in $\Theta(n^{3/2})$ generations. Therefore, our construction provides the first explicit example which realizes the pessimism of the \poea model. Our simulations demonstrate matching runtimes for both the static and the self-adjusting $(1,\lambda)$-EA and $(1+\lambda)$-EA. Moreover, devising an example for fixed dimension, we illustrate that drift minimization does not equal maximal runtime beyond asymptotic analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>revis...</summary><p>revised journal version</p></details> |

Under controlled water tank validation conditions, StreakNet-Arch with Self-Attention or DBC-Attention outperforms traditional bandpass filtering and achieves higher $F_1$ scores than learning-based MP networks and CNNs at comparable model size and complexity. Real-time benchmarks on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 show a constant Average Imaging Time (54 to 84 ms) regardless of frame count, versus a linear increase (58 to 1,257 ms) for conventional methods. To facilitate further research, we contribute a publicly available streak-tube camera image dataset contains 2,695,168 real-world underwater 3D point cloud data. More importantly, we validate our UCLR system in a South China Sea trial, reaching an error of 46mm for 3D target at 1,000 m depth and 20 m range.

However, a majority of existing approaches are predicated on static, embedding-based scoring, exhibiting inherent limitations in capturing contextual dependencies and relational dynamics. Addressing this gap, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework. FMS comprises two principal components: (1) a semantic context learning module that encodes context-sensitive entity representations, and (2) a conditional flow-matching module designed to learn the dynamic transformation from a head to a tail embedding, governed by the aforementioned context. The resultant predictive vector field, representing the context-informed relational path, serves to dynamically refine the initial static score of an entity pair. Through this synergy of context-aware static representations and conditioned dynamic information, FMS facilitates a more profound modeling of relational semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing studies have paid insufficient attention to the intrinsic spatial properties of depth maps. This oversight significantly impacts the attention representation, leading to prediction errors caused by attention shift issues. To this end, we propose a novel learnable Depth interaction Pyramid Transformer (DiPFormer) to explore the effectiveness of depth. Firstly, we introduce Depth Spatial-Aware Optimization (Depth SAO) as offset to represent real-world spatial relationships. Secondly, the similarity in the feature space of RGB-D is learned by Depth Linear Cross-Attention (Depth LCA) to clarify spatial differences at the pixel level. Finally, an MLP Decoder is utilized to effectively fuse multi-scale features for meeting real-time requirements. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DiPFormer significantly addresses the issue of attention misalignment in both road detection (+7.5%) and semantic segmentation (+4.9% / +1.5%) tasks. DiPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI (97.57% F-score on KITTI road and 68.74% mIoU on KITTI-360) and Cityscapes (83.4% mIoU) datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

While existing theoretical works demonstrate that CoTs with discrete tokens boost the capability of LLMs, recent work on continuous CoTs lacks a theoretical understanding of why it outperforms discrete counterparts in various reasoning tasks such as directed graph reachability, a fundamental graph reasoning problem that includes many practical domain applications as special cases. In this paper, we prove that a two-layer transformer with $D$ steps of continuous CoTs can solve the directed graph reachability problem, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph, while the best known result of constant-depth transformers with discrete CoTs requires $O(n^2)$ decoding steps where $n$ is the number of vertices ($D<n$). In our construction, each continuous thought vector is a superposition state that encodes multiple search frontiers simultaneously (i.e., parallel breadth-first search (BFS)), while discrete CoTs must choose a single path sampled from the superposition state, which leads to sequential search that requires many more steps and may be trapped into local solutions. We also performed extensive experiments to verify that our theoretical construction aligns well with the empirical solution obtained via training dynamics. Notably, encoding of multiple search frontiers as a superposition state automatically emerges in training continuous CoTs, without explicit supervision to guide the model to explore multiple paths simultaneously.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

We propose LUPIN, a Lagrangian Double U-Net for Physics-Informed Nowcasting, that draws from existing extrapolation-based nowcasting methods. It consists of a U-Net that dynamically produces mesoscale advection motion fields, a differentiable semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an advection-free U-Net capturing the growth and decay of precipitation over time. Using our approach, we successfully implement the Lagrangian convolutional neural network for precipitation nowcasting in a fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated manner. This allows for end-to-end training and inference, including the data-driven Lagrangian coordinate system transformation of the data at runtime. We evaluate the model and compare it with other related AI-based models both quantitatively and qualitatively in an extreme event case study.

How can we deliver such property to the current distributional sentence representations to control and interpret the generation of language models (LMs)? In this work, we theoretically frame the sentence semantics as the composition of \textit{semantic role - word content} features and propose the formal semantic geometry. To inject such geometry into Transformer-based LMs (i.e. GPT2), we deploy Transformer-based Variational AutoEncoder with a supervision approach, where the sentence generation can be manipulated and explained over low-dimensional latent Gaussian space. In addition, we propose a new probing algorithm to guide the movement of sentence vectors over such geometry. Experimental results reveal that the formal semantic geometry can potentially deliver better control and interpretation to sentence generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoNLL...</summary><p>CoNLL2025 (Best Paper nomination)</p></details> |

They are devoted to learning the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. As a SNPE technique, the automatic posterior transformation (APT) method proposed by Greenberg et al. (2019) performs notably and scales to high dimensional data. However, the APT method bears the computation of an expectation of the logarithm of an intractable normalizing constant, i.e., a nested expectation. Although atomic APT was proposed to solve this by discretizing the normalizing constant, it remains challenging to analyze the convergence of learning. In this paper, we propose a nested APT method to estimate the involved nested expectation instead. This facilitates establishing the convergence analysis. Since the nested estimators for the loss function and its gradient are biased, we make use of unbiased multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators for debiasing. To further reduce the excessive variance of the unbiased estimators, this paper also develops some truncated MLMC estimators by taking account of the trade-off between the bias and the average cost. Numerical experiments for approximating complex posteriors with multimodal in moderate dimensions are provided.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing RL benchmarks lack the ability to systematically evaluate representation learning capabilities in isolation from other learning challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Sliding Puzzles Gym (SPGym), a novel benchmark that transforms the classic 8-tile puzzle into a visual RL task with images drawn from arbitrarily large datasets. SPGym's key innovation lies in its ability to precisely control representation learning complexity through adjustable grid sizes and image pools, while maintaining fixed environment dynamics, observation, and action spaces. This design enables researchers to isolate and scale the visual representation challenge independently of other learning components. Through extensive experiments with model-free and model-based RL algorithms, we uncover fundamental limitations in current methods' ability to handle visual diversity. As we increase the pool of possible images, all algorithms exhibit in- and out-of-distribution performance degradation, with sophisticated representation learning techniques often underperforming simpler approaches like data augmentation. These findings highlight critical gaps in visual representation learning for RL and establish SPGym as a valuable tool for driving progress in robust, generalizable decision-making systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements.

This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions. (1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications. (4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions. By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ma...</summary><p>We maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking progress at: https://github.com/zhaochen0110/Awesome_Think_With_Images</p></details> |

While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation). However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways, limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor (NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning benchmarks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Transformers from Diffusion: A Unified Framework for Neural Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09111v4)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning representations for structured data with certain geometries (e.g., observed or unobserved) is a fundamental challenge, wherein message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have become a de facto class of model solutions. In this paper, inspired by physical systems, we propose an energy-constrained diffusion model, which integrates the inductive bias of diffusion on manifolds with layer-wise constraints of energy minimization. We identify that the diffusion operators have a one-to-one correspondence with the energy functions implicitly descended by the diffusion process, and the finite-difference iteration for solving the energy-constrained diffusion system induces the propagation layers of various types of MPNNs operating on observed or latent structures. This leads to a unified mathematical framework for common neural architectures whose computational flows can be cast as message passing (or its special case), including MLPs, GNNs, and Transformers. Building on these insights, we devise a new class of neural message passing models, dubbed diffusion-inspired Transformers (DIFFormer), whose global attention layers are derived from the principled energy-constrained diffusion framework. Across diverse datasets ranging from real-world networks to images, texts, and physical particles, we demonstrate that the new model achieves promising performance in scenarios where the data structures are observed (as a graph), partially observed, or entirely unobserved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).

It has been believed that weights in LLMs contain significant redundancy, leading to the conception that a considerable chunk of the parameters can be removed by pruning without compromising performance. Contrary to this belief, this paper presents a counter-argument: small-magnitude weights of pre-trained model weights encode vital knowledge essential for tackling difficult downstream tasks - manifested as the monotonic relationship between the performance drop of downstream tasks across the difficulty spectrum, as we prune more pre-trained weights by magnitude. Moreover, we reveal that these seemingly inconsequential weights can result in irreparable loss of knowledge and performance degradation in difficult tasks, even when downstream continual training is allowed. Interestingly, our evaluations show that the other popular compression, namely quantization, fails to exhibit similar monotonic effect and does not as convincingly disentangle this task-difficulty information. To study formally, we introduce several quantifiable metrics to gauge the downstream task difficulty: (1) within the same task category, and (2) across different task categories. Our extensive experiments substantiate the Junk DNA Hypothesis across a diverse range of model sizes, tasks, datasets, and even pruning methods.

We propose TabNSA, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Native Sparse Attention (NSA) with a TabMixer backbone to efficiently model tabular data. TabNSA tackles computational and representational challenges by dynamically focusing on relevant feature subsets per instance. The NSA module employs a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism, including token compression, selective preservation, and localized sliding windows, to significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of standard attention operations while addressing feature heterogeneity. Complementing this, the TabMixer backbone captures complex, non-linear dependencies through parallel multilayer perceptron (MLP) branches with independent parameters. These modules are synergistically combined via element-wise summation and mean pooling, enabling TabNSA to model both global context and fine-grained interactions. Extensive experiments across supervised and transfer learning settings show that TabNSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, by augmenting TabNSA with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), we enable it to effectively address Few-Shot Learning challenges through language-guided generalization on diverse tabular benchmarks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 tables |

A growing body of work focuses on generating text from multi-channeled ECG signals and corresponding textual prompts. Existing approaches often involve a two-stage process: pretraining an ECG-specific encoder with a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective, followed by finetuning an LLM for natural language generation (NLG) using encoder-derived features. However, these methods face two key limitations: inefficiency due to multi-stage training and challenges in interpreting encoder-generated features. To overcome these issues, we propose ECG-Byte, an adapted byte pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer pipeline for autoregressive language modeling of ECGs. ECG-Byte compresses and encodes ECG signals into tokens, enabling direct end-to-end LLM training by combining ECG and text tokens. This approach enhances interpretability, as ECG tokens can be directly mapped back to the original signals. Leveraging ECG-Byte, we achieve competitive NLG performance while training 3 times faster and using just 48\% of the data required by traditional two-stage methods.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score-function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a task-dependent score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived exactly from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title changed, main text substantially revised, including new experiments, method acronym changed, references added. 34 pages, 11 figures, 2tables</p></details> |

Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, due to the need for per-sample network training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time. We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7 different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at 0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by 0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar speeds.

However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%.

This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising 8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc., providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of 90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain.

In this work, we propose Zenesis, a comprehensive no-code interactive platform designed to minimize barriers posed by data readiness for scientific images. We develop lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and heuristic-based temporal enhancement options. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through comprehensive comparison and validation on challenging Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) data of catalyst-loaded membranes. Zenesis significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average accuracy of 0.947, an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.858, and a Dice score of 0.923 for amorphous catalyst samples and accuracy of 0.987, an IOU of 0.857, and a Dice score of 0.923 for crystalline samples. These results mark a substantial improvement over traditional methods like Otsu thresholding and even advanced models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) when used in isolation. Our results demonstrate that Zenesis is a powerful tool for scientific applications, particularly in fields where high-quality annotated datasets are unavailable, accelerating accurate analysis of experimental imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a draft on arxiv.

This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | 39 Pages, 7 Figures |

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

This research tackles this challenge by transforming complex medical documents -- in this case, prosthetic device user manuals -- into accessible formats for underserved populations. This case study in cross-cultural translation is particularly pertinent/relevant for communities that receive donated prosthetic devices but may not receive the accompanying user documentation. Or, if available online, may only be available in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context). The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users -- such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 0 figures, 0 tables</p></details> |

Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g., masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore, high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence modeling in MIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISMIR 2025</p></details> |

When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.</p></details> | ISMIR (2025) |

Recent advancements in efficient point cloud transformers have underscored the efficacy of integrating information in sparse formats. When it comes to fusion, since image patches are dense in pixel space with ambiguous depth, it necessitates additional design considerations for effective fusion. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of design choices for Transformer-based sparse cameraLiDAR fusion. This investigation encompasses strategies for image-to-3D and LiDAR-to-2D mapping, attention neighbor grouping, single modal tokenizer, and micro-structure of Transformer. By amalgamating the most effective principles uncovered through our investigation, we introduce FlatFusion, a carefully designed framework for sparse camera-LiDAR fusion. Notably, FlatFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse Transformer-based methods, including UniTR, CMT, and SparseFusion, achieving 73.7 NDS on the nuScenes validation set with 10.1 FPS with PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-anchored Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. Additionally, we introduce a straightforward differentiable attribute search method to identify representative and suitable attributes for downstream tasks. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing basic prompt format in textual-based methods, providing general improvements at a negligible computational cost. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

Unlike image-to-image translation, which prioritizes structural fidelity, stylized abstraction demands selective retention of identity cues while embracing stylistic divergence, especially challenging for out-of-distribution individuals. We propose a training-free framework that generates stylized abstractions from a single image using inference-time scaling in vision-language models (VLLMs) to extract identity-relevant features, and a novel cross-domain rectified flow inversion strategy that reconstructs structure based on style-dependent priors. Our method adapts structural restoration dynamically through style-aware temporal scheduling, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions that honor both subject and style. It supports multi-round abstraction-aware generation without fine-tuning. To evaluate this task, we introduce StyleBench, a GPT-based human-aligned metric suited for abstract styles where pixel-level similarity fails. Experiments across diverse abstraction (e.g., LEGO, knitted dolls, South Park) show strong generalization to unseen identities and styles in a fully open-source setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://kartik-3004.github.io/TF-SA/</p></details> |
| **[Meta-Posterior Consistency for the Bayesian Inference of Metastable System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01868v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast majority of the literature on learning dynamical systems or stochastic processes from time series has focused on stable or ergodic systems, for both Bayesian and frequentist inference procedures. However, most real-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be stable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales. Consistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one can ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when observations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on longer time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify metaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be exploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system, where inference on the global behavior may require much more data, or there is no theoretical guarantee as to the asymptotic success of inference procedures. We also discuss the relation between metaconsistency and the spectral properties of the model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic and non-ergodic diffusions.</p></details> | 32 pages, 3 figures |

Standard analysis conventions discard information and severely limit the scope of the causal questions that can be probed. To address this gap, we 1) draw connections to the causal inference literature on sequentially randomized experiments, 2) propose a non-parametric framework for analyzing "open-loop" (static regime) optogenetics behavioral experiments, 3) derive extensions of history-restricted marginal structural models for dynamic treatment regimes with positivity violations for "closed-loop" designs, and 4) propose a taxonomy of identifiable causal effects that encompass a far richer collection of scientific questions compared to standard methods. From another view, our work extends "excursion effect" methods, popularized recently in the mobile health literature, to enable estimation of causal contrasts for treatment sequences in the presence of positivity violations. We describe sufficient conditions for identifiability of the proposed causal estimands, and provide asymptotic statistical guarantees for a proposed inverse probability-weighted estimator, a multiply-robust estimator (for two intervention timepoints), a framework for hypothesis testing, and a computationally scalable implementation. Finally, we apply our framework to data from a recent neuroscience study and show how it provides insight into causal effects of optogenetics on behavior that are obscured by standard analyses.</p></details> | 62 pages, 18 figures |

Recently, the sparse orthogonal factor regression (SOFAR) framework, based on the sparse singular value decomposition (SVD) within the coefficient matrix, was introduced for interpretable multi-task learning, enabling the discovery of meaningful latent feature-response association networks across different layers. However, conducting precise inference on the latent factor matrices has remained challenging due to the orthogonality constraints inherited from the sparse SVD constraints. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach called the high-dimensional manifold-based SOFAR inference (SOFARI), drawing on the Neyman near-orthogonality inference while incorporating the Stiefel manifold structure imposed by the SVD constraints. By leveraging the underlying Stiefel manifold structure that is crucial to enabling inference, SOFARI provides easy-to-use bias-corrected estimators for both latent left factor vectors and singular values, for which we show to enjoy the asymptotic mean-zero normal distributions with estimable variances. We introduce two SOFARI variants to handle strongly and weakly orthogonal latent factors, where the latter covers a broader range of applications. We illustrate the effectiveness of SOFARI and justify our theoretical results through simulation examples and a real data application in economic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>208 p...</summary><p>208 pages, 2 figures, to appear in Journal of the American Statistical Association</p></details> |

We propose LUPIN, a Lagrangian Double U-Net for Physics-Informed Nowcasting, that draws from existing extrapolation-based nowcasting methods. It consists of a U-Net that dynamically produces mesoscale advection motion fields, a differentiable semi-Lagrangian extrapolation operator, and an advection-free U-Net capturing the growth and decay of precipitation over time. Using our approach, we successfully implement the Lagrangian convolutional neural network for precipitation nowcasting in a fully differentiable and GPU-accelerated manner. This allows for end-to-end training and inference, including the data-driven Lagrangian coordinate system transformation of the data at runtime. We evaluate the model and compare it with other related AI-based models both quantitatively and qualitatively in an extreme event case study. Based on our evaluation, LUPIN matches and even exceeds the performance of the chosen benchmarks, opening the door for other Lagrangian machine learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Applied Computing and Geosciences</p></details> |

Their ability to leverage prior knowledge from massive datasets has streamlined the development of intelligent pathology models. However, we identify several critical and interrelated ethical risks that remain underexplored, yet must be addressed to enable the safe translation of PFMs from lab to clinic. These include the potential leakage of patient-sensitive attributes, disparities in model performance across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the reliance on diagnosis-irrelevant features that undermine clinical reliability. In this study, we pioneer the quantitative analysis for ethical risks in PFMs, including privacy leakage, clinical reliability, and group fairness. Specifically, we propose an evaluation framework that systematically measures key dimensions of ethical concern: the degree to which patient-sensitive attributes can be inferred from model representations, the extent of performance disparities across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the influence of diagnostically irrelevant features on model decisions. We further investigate the underlying causes of these ethical risks in PFMs and empirically validate our findings. Then we offer insights into potential directions for mitigating such risks, aiming to inform the development of more ethically robust PFMs. This work provides the first quantitative and systematic evaluation of ethical risks in PFMs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for ethical safeguards in PFMs and offer actionable insights for building more trustworthy and clinically robust PFMs. To facilitate future research and deployment, we will release the assessment framework as an online toolkit to support the development, auditing, and deployment of ethically robust PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages,5 figure,23 tables</p></details> |

Therefore, content moderation is crucial to ensure their safety and well-being. However, the effectiveness of many moderation interventions is still uncertain. Here, we apply a causal inference approach to shed light on the effectiveness of The Great Ban, a massive social media deplatforming intervention on Reddit. We analyze 53M comments shared by nearly 34K users, providing in-depth results on both the intended and unintended consequences of the ban. Our causal analyses reveal that 15.6% of the moderated users abandoned the platform while the remaining ones decreased their overall toxicity by 4.1%. Nonetheless, a small subset of users exhibited marked increases in both the intensity and volume of toxic behavior, particularly among those whose activity levels changed after the intervention. However, these reactions were not accompanied by greater activity or engagement, suggesting that even the most toxic users maintained a limited overall impact. Our findings bring to light new insights on the effectiveness of deplatforming moderation interventions. Furthermore, they also contribute to informing future content moderation strategies and regulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.11254 This work is an extension of this conference paper: Cima, L., Trujillo, A., Avvenuti, M., & Cresci, S.

Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way 5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots), while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures; added FSL power consumption measurements at 100 kHz clock speed, fixed typos</p></details> |

Conditional Local Independence (CLI), which describes whether the evolution of one process is influenced by another process given additional processes, is important for causal learning in such systems. However, existing CLI tests were limited to counting processes. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric CLT test for It\^o processes. Specifically, we first introduce a testing statistic based on the Local Covariance Measure (LCM) by constructing a martingale from the conditional expectation of the process of interest. For estimation, we propose an efficient estimator based on the optimal filtering equation, which can achieve root-N consistency. To establish the asymptotic level and power of the test, we relax the restrictive boundedness condition to a moment bound condition, which is practical for It\^o processes. We verify the proposed test in synthetic and real-world experiments.</p></details> | Working paper |

Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors. To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale AI/ML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>IWQoS...</summary><p>IWQoS 2025 (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> |

However, as task diversity and complexity increase, EVIT faces significant challenges in resolving data conflicts. To address this limitation, we propose the Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (Dual-LoRA), a holistic-to-local framework that enhances the adapter's capacity to address data conflict through dual structural optimization. Specifically, we utilize two subspaces: a skill space for stable, holistic knowledge retention, and a rank-rectified task space that locally activates the holistic knowledge. Additionally, we introduce Visual Cue Enhancement (VCE), a multi-level local feature aggregation module designed to enrich the vision-language projection with local details. Our approach is both memory- and time-efficient, requiring only 1.16$\times$ the inference time of the standard LoRA method (with injection into the query and value projection layers), and just 73\% of the inference time of a 4-expert LoRA-MoE. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and general MLLM benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Towards the Training of Deeper Predictive Coding Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23800v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process. Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities for their application in complex tasks.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 7 figures |
| **[Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16553v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). To train the proposed model, we propose a novel coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy.

We present a novel approach called SAGE that uses latent variables to control long-horizon behavior in dialogue generation. At the core of our method is the State-Action Chain (SAC), which augments standard language model fine-tuning by introducing latent variables that encapsulate emotional states and conversational strategies between dialogue turns. During inference, these variables are generated before each response, enabling coarse-grained control over dialogue progression while maintaining natural interaction patterns. We also introduce a self-improvement pipeline that leverages dialogue tree search, LLM-based reward modeling, and targeted fine-tuning to optimize conversational trajectories. Our experimental results show that models trained with this approach demonstrate improved performance in emotional intelligence metrics while maintaining strong capabilities on LLM benchmarks. The discrete nature of our latent variables facilitates search-based strategies and provides a foundation for future applications of reinforcement learning to dialogue systems, where learning can occur at the state level rather than the token level. https://github.com/apple/ml-sage-dialog-gen</p></details> | 9 pages main text |
| **[Plastic tensor networks for interpretable generative modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06722v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed as an alternative paradigm for generative modeling. The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.</p></details> | 18 pages, 17 figures |
| **[An Automatic Graph Construction Framework based on Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18241v2)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |

However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with hardware-supported fine-grained scaling emerging as a promising solution to mitigate outliers. However, existing methods struggle to capture nuanced block data distributions. We propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from a formatbook for better data representation. Additionally, we introduce DialectFP4, a formatbook of FP4 variants (akin to dialects) that adapt to diverse data distributions. To leverage this efficiently, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures energy efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. BlockDialect achieves 10.78% (7.48%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with lower bit usage per data, while being only 5.45% (2.69%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication. Focusing on how to represent over how to scale, our work presents a promising path for energy-efficient LLM inference.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

The tasks of knowledge retrieval and answer generation tasks both necessitate precise multimodal understanding of question context and external knowledge. However, existing methods treat these two stages as separate modules with limited interaction during training, which hinders bi-directional parametric knowledge sharing, ultimately leading to suboptimal performance. To fully exploit the cross-task synergy in KB-VQA, we propose a unified retrieval-augmented VQA framework with collaborative parametric knowledge calibration. The proposed framework can effectively adapt general multimodal pre-trained models for fine-grained, knowledge-intensive tasks while enabling the retriever and generator to collaboratively enhance and share their parametric knowledge during both training and inference. To enhance fine-grained understanding of questions and external documents, we also integrate late interaction mechanism into the proposed training framework. Additionally, we introduce a reflective-answering mechanism that allows the model to explicitly evaluate and refine its knowledge boundary.

DynaCLR integrates single-cell tracking and time-aware contrastive sampling to learn robust, temporally regularized representations of cell dynamics. DynaCLR embeddings generalize effectively to in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, and can be used for several downstream tasks with sparse human annotations. We demonstrate efficient annotations of cell states with a human-in-the-loop using fluorescence and label-free imaging channels. DynaCLR method enables diverse downstream biological analyses: classification of cell division and infection, clustering heterogeneous cell migration patterns, cross-modal distillation of cell states from fluorescence to label-free channel, alignment of asynchronous cellular responses and broken cell tracks, and discovering organelle response due to infection. DynaCLR is a flexible method for comparative analyses of dynamic cellular responses to pharmacological, microbial, and genetic perturbations. We provide PyTorch-based implementations of the model training and inference pipeline (https://github.com/mehta-lab/viscy) and a GUI (https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/napari-iohub) for the visualization and annotation of trajectories of cells in the real space and the embedding space.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 6 figures, 13 appendix figures, 5 videos (ancillary files)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Attentive Neural Processes for Planning with Pushing Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17924v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our goal is to enable robots to plan sequences of tabletop actions to push a block with unknown physical properties to a desired goal pose. We approach this problem by learning the constituent models of a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the robot can observe the outcome of a push, but the physical properties of the block that govern the dynamics remain unknown. A common solution approach is to train an observation model in a supervised fashion, and do inference with a general inference technique such as particle filters. However, supervised training requires knowledge of the relevant physical properties that determine the problem dynamics, which we do not assume to be known. Planning also requires simulating many belief updates, which becomes expensive when using particle filters to represent the belief. We propose to learn an Attentive Neural Process that computes the belief over a learned latent representation of the relevant physical properties given a history of actions. To address the pushing planning problem, we integrate a trained Neural Process with a double-progressive widening sampling strategy. Simulation results indicate that Neural Process Tree with Double Progressive Widening (NPT-DPW) generates better-performing plans faster than traditional particle-filter methods that use a supervised-trained observation model, even in complex pushing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 2025 RoboReps Workshop</p></details> |

Despite this progress, the effects of data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models. Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally, we show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex and imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

Our central result is a `transference principle': the complex margin-conditioned matrix can be closely approximated by a simpler matrix whose entries are independent and drawn from an exponential tilting of the original model. The tilt parameters are determined by the sum of two potentials. We establish phase diagrams for `tame margins', where these potentials are uniformly bounded. This framework resolves a 2011 conjecture by Chatterjee, Diaconis, and Sly on $\delta$-tame degree sequences and generalizes a sharp phase transition in contingency tables obtained by Dittmer, Lyu, and Pak in 2020. For tame margins, we show that a generalized Sinkhorn algorithm can compute the potentials at a dimension-free exponential rate. Our limit theory further establishes that for a convergent sequence of tame margins, the potentials converge as fast as the margins converge. We apply this framework and obtain several key results for the conditioned matrix: The marginal distribution of any single entry is asymptotically an exponential tilting of the base measure, resolving a 2010 conjecture by Barvinok on contingency tables. The conditioned matrix concentrates in cut norm around a `typical table' (the expectation of the tilted model), which acts as a static Schr\"odinger bridge between the margins. The empirical singular value distribution of the rescaled matrix converges to an explicit law determined by the variance profile of the tilted model. In particular, we confirm the universality of the Marchenko-Pastur law for constant linear margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>69 pa...</summary><p>69 pages, 2 figures.

In response to this challenge, efforts have been directed toward the application of traditional network pruning techniques to LLMs, uncovering a massive number of parameters that can be pruned in one-shot without hurting performance. Prevailing LLM pruning strategies have consistently adhered to the practice of uniformly pruning all layers at equivalent sparsity, resulting in robust performance. However, this observation stands in contrast to the prevailing trends observed in the field of vision models, where non-uniform layerwise sparsity typically yields stronger results. To understand the underlying reasons for this disparity, we conduct a comprehensive study and discover a strong correlation with the emergence of activation outliers in LLMs. Inspired by this finding, we introduce a novel LLM pruning methodology that incorporates a tailored set of non-uniform layerwise sparsity ratios, termed as Outlier Weighed Layerwise sparsity (OWL). The sparsity ratio of OWL is proportional to the outlier ratio observed within each layer, facilitating a more effective alignment between layerwise weight sparsity and outlier ratios. Our empirical evaluation, conducted across the LLaMA-V1 family and OPT, spanning various benchmarks, demonstrates the distinct advantages offered by OWL over previous methods. For instance, OWL exhibits a remarkable performance gain, surpassing the state-of-the-art Wanda and SparseGPT by 61.22 and 6.80 perplexity at a high sparsity level of 70%, respectively, while delivering 2.6x end-to-end inference speed-up in the DeepSparse inference engine.

Finding an L-system for a given process is typically solved by hand, by experts, in a massively time-consuming process. It would be significant if this could be done automatically from data, such as from sequences of images. In this paper, we are interested in inferring a particular type of L-system, deterministic context-free L-system (D0L-system) from a sequence of strings. We introduce the characteristic graph of a sequence of strings, which we then utilize to translate our problem (inferring D0L-systems) in polynomial time into the maximum independent set problem (MIS) and the SAT problem. After that, we offer a classical exact algorithm and an approximate quantum algorithm for the problem.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure |

We propose and evaluate a Model-Router framework that dynamically selects the most suitable forecasting model-spanning classical, ML, and DL methods for each product based on its unique demand pattern. By comparing rule-based, LightGBM, and InceptionTime routers, our approach learns to assign appropriate forecasting strategies, effectively differentiating between smooth, lumpy, or intermittent demand regimes to optimize predictions. Experiments on the large-scale Favorita dataset show our deep learning (Inception Time) router improves forecasting accuracy by up to 11.8% (NWRMSLE) over strong, single-model benchmarks with 4.67x faster inference time. Ultimately, these gains in forecasting precision will drive substantial reductions in both stockouts and wasteful excess inventory, underscoring the critical role of intelligent, adaptive Al in optimizing contemporary supply chain operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

Yet, the size of the KV cache grows proportionally with the input length, burdening both memory bandwidth and capacity as decoding progresses. To address this challenge, we present RocketKV, a training-free KV cache compression strategy containing two consecutive stages. In the first stage, it performs coarse-grain permanent KV cache eviction on the input sequence tokens. In the second stage, it adopts a hybrid sparse attention method to conduct fine-grain top-k sparse attention, approximating the attention scores by leveraging both head and sequence dimensionality reductions. We show that RocketKV provides a compression ratio of up to 400$\times$, end-to-end speedup of up to 3.7$\times$ as well as peak memory reduction of up to 32.6% in the decode phase on an NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to the full KV cache baseline, while achieving negligible accuracy loss on a variety of long-context tasks. We also propose a variant of RocketKV for multi-turn scenarios, which consistently outperforms other existing methods and achieves accuracy nearly on par with an oracle top-k attention scheme.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of brick structures, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that BrickGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing brick structures that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based brick texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms.

However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%.

Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces C3VDv2, the second version (v2) of the high-definition Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset, featuring enhanced realism designed to facilitate the quantitative evaluation of 3D colon reconstruction algorithms. 192 video sequences were captured by imaging 60 unique, high-fidelity silicone colon phantom segments. Ground truth depth, surface normals, optical flow, occlusion, six-degree-of-freedom pose, coverage maps, and 3D models are provided for 169 colonoscopy videos. Eight simulated screening colonoscopy videos acquired by a gastroenterologist are provided with ground truth poses. The dataset includes 15 videos featuring colon deformations for qualitative assessment. C3VDv2 emulates diverse and challenging scenarios for 3D reconstruction algorithms, including fecal debris, mucous pools, blood, debris obscuring the colonoscope lens, en-face views, and fast camera motion. The enhanced realism of C3VDv2 will allow for more robust and representative development and evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Characterizations and Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04194v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap. In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples. We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational studies with complex treatment mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 38th Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) 2025. v2 strengthens results to give a tight characterization for ATE identification</p></details> |

A key challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths. Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans. With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10% improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main article : 16 pages, 7 figures and 4 tables.

In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack.

Such analyses require multivariate models capable of accounting for the complex correlation structures between microbes and metabolites. However, existing multivariate models often suffer from low statistical power for detecting microbiome-metabolome interactions due to small sample sizes and weak biological signals. To address these challenges, we introduce CoMMiT, Co-informed inference of Microbiome-Metabolome Interactions via novel Transfer learning models. Unlike conventional transfer-learning methods that borrow information from external datasets, CoMMiT leverages similarities across metabolites within a single cohort, reducing the risk of negative transfer often caused by differences in sequencing platforms and bioinformatic pipelines across studies. CoMMiT operates under the flexible assumption that auxiliary metabolites are collectively informative for the target metabolite, without requiring individual auxiliary metabolites to be informative. CoMMiT uses a novel data-driven approach to selecting the optimal set of auxiliary metabolites. Using this optimal set, CoMMiT employs a de-biasing framework to enable efficient calculation of p-values, facilitating the identification of statistically significant microbiome-metabolome interactions. Applying CoMMiT to a feeding study reveals biologically meaningful microbiome-metabolome interactions under a low glycemic load diet, demonstrating the diet-host link through gut metabolism.</p></details> | 38 pages, 5 figures |

This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | 39 Pages, 7 Figures |

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

Despite notable progress in recent years, existing methods still exhibit a noticeable gap when considering all these aspects. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReferDINO}, a strong RVOS model that inherits region-level vision-language alignment from foundational visual grounding models, and is further endowed with pixel-level dense perception and cross-modal spatiotemporal reasoning. In detail, ReferDINO integrates two key components: 1) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that utilizes location prediction to progressively guide mask prediction through differentiable deformation mechanisms; 2) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that injects pretrained time-varying text features into inter-frame interaction to capture object-aware dynamic changes. Moreover, a confidence-aware query pruning strategy is designed to accelerate object decoding without compromising model performance. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our ReferDINO significantly outperforms previous methods (e.g., +3.9% (\mathcal{J}&\mathcal{F}) on Ref-YouTube-VOS) with real-time inference speed (51 FPS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[The Illusion of Progress? A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24000v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github link: https://github.com/TomSheng21/tta-vlm</p></details> |
| **[StyleDrive: Towards Driving-Style Aware Benchmarking of End-To-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23982v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics. To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems, catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant progress in recent years, most existing methods focus on uniformly distributed datasets, significantly limiting the practical applicability of their methods. In this paper, we propose a more practical problem setting named deep imbalanced clustering, where the underlying classes exhibit an imbalance distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel optimal transport-based pseudo-label learning framework. Our framework formulates pseudo-label generation as a Semantic-regularized Progressive Partial Optimal Transport (SP$^2$OT) problem, which progressively transports each sample to imbalanced clusters under prior and semantic relation constraints, thus generating high-quality and imbalance-aware pseudo-labels. To solve the SP$^2$OT problem, we propose a projected mirror descent algorithm, which alternates between: (1) computing the gradient of the SP$^2$OT objective, and (2) performing gradient descent with projection via an entropy-regularized progressive partial optimal transport formulation. Furthermore, we formulate the second step as an unbalanced optimal transport problem with augmented constraints and develop an efficient solution based on fast matrix scaling algorithms. Experiments on various datasets, including a human-curated long-tailed CIFAR100, challenging ImageNet-R, and large-scale subsets of fine-grained iNaturalist2018 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

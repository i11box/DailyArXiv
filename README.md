| **[VLN-R1: Vision-Language Navigation via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17221v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a core challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to navigate real-world environments using natural language instructions. Current language model-based navigation systems operate on discrete topological graphs, limiting path planning to predefined node connections. We propose VLN-R1, an end-to-end framework that leverages Large Vision-Language Models (LVLM) to directly translate egocentric video streams into continuous navigation actions, adopting GRPO-based training inspired by DeepSeek-R1. To enable effective training, we first construct the VLN-Ego dataset using a 3D simulator, Habitat, and propose Long-Short Memory Sampling to balance historical and current observations. While large language models can supervise complete textual instructions, they lack fine-grained action-level control. Our framework employs a two-stage training approach: a) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to align the model's action sequence text predictions with expert demonstrations, followed by b) Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) enhanced with a Time-Decayed Reward (TDR) mechanism that strategically weights multi-step future actions. Experimental results show VLN-R1 achieves strong performance on VLN-CE benchmark. VLN-R1 proves LVLMs can drive embodied navigation and enhance task-specific reasoning through data-efficient, reward-driven post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: www.vlnr1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Emergent Temporal Correspondences from Video Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17220v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video diffusion models based on Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved remarkable success in generating temporally coherent videos. Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https:/cvlab-kaist.github.io/DiffTrack</p></details> |
| **[Machine Mental Imagery: Empower Multimodal Reasoning with Latent Visual Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17218v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding, yet their text-only decoding forces them to verbalize visual reasoning, limiting performance on tasks that demand visual imagination. Recent attempts train VLMs to render explicit images, but the heavy image-generation pre-training often hinders the reasoning ability. Inspired by the way humans reason with mental imagery-the internal construction and manipulation of visual cues-we investigate whether VLMs can reason through interleaved multimodal trajectories without producing explicit images. To this end, we present a Machine Mental Imagery framework, dubbed as Mirage, which augments VLM decoding with latent visual tokens alongside ordinary text. Concretely, whenever the model chooses to ``think visually'', it recasts its hidden states as next tokens, thereby continuing a multimodal trajectory without generating pixel-level images. Begin by supervising the latent tokens through distillation from ground-truth image embeddings, we then switch to text-only supervision to make the latent trajectory align tightly with the task objective. A subsequent reinforcement learning stage further enhances the multimodal reasoning capability. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Mirage unlocks stronger multimodal reasoning without explicit image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vlm-mirage.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Long-term Traffic Simulation with Interleaved Autoregressive Motion and Scenario Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17213v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Fine-Tuning Lowers Safety and Disrupts Evaluation Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17209v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for a specific domain or task has become a routine procedure for ordinary users. However, fine-tuning is known to remove the safety alignment features of the model, even when the fine-tuning data does not contain any harmful content. We consider this to be a critical failure mode of LLMs due to the widespread uptake of fine-tuning, combined with the benign nature of the "attack". Most well-intentioned developers are likely unaware that they are deploying an LLM with reduced safety. On the other hand, this known vulnerability can be easily exploited by malicious actors intending to bypass safety guardrails. To make any meaningful progress in mitigating this issue, we first need reliable and reproducible safety evaluations. In this work, we investigate how robust a safety benchmark is to trivial variations in the experimental procedure, and the stochastic nature of LLMs. Our initial experiments expose surprising variance in the results of the safety evaluation, even when seemingly inconsequential changes are made to the fine-tuning setup. Our observations have serious implications for how researchers in this field should report results to enable meaningful comparisons in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at LLMSEC 2025</p></details> |
| **[DreamCube: 3D Panorama Generation via Multi-plane Synchronization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17206v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D panorama synthesis is a promising yet challenging task that demands high-quality and diverse visual appearance and geometry of the generated omnidirectional content. Existing methods leverage rich image priors from pre-trained 2D foundation models to circumvent the scarcity of 3D panoramic data, but the incompatibility between 3D panoramas and 2D single views limits their effectiveness. In this work, we demonstrate that by applying multi-plane synchronization to the operators from 2D foundation models, their capabilities can be seamlessly extended to the omnidirectional domain. Based on this design, we further introduce DreamCube, a multi-plane RGB-D diffusion model for 3D panorama generation, which maximizes the reuse of 2D foundation model priors to achieve diverse appearances and accurate geometry while maintaining multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in panoramic image generation, panoramic depth estimation, and 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yukun-huang.github.io/DreamCube/</p></details> |
| **[Network Sparsity Unlocks the Scaling Potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17204v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively scaling up deep reinforcement learning models has proven notoriously difficult due to network pathologies during training, motivating various targeted interventions such as periodic reset and architectural advances such as layer normalization. Instead of pursuing more complex modifications, we show that introducing static network sparsity alone can unlock further scaling potential beyond their dense counterparts with state-of-the-art architectures. This is achieved through simple one-shot random pruning, where a predetermined percentage of network weights are randomly removed once before training. Our analysis reveals that, in contrast to naively scaling up dense DRL networks, such sparse networks achieve both higher parameter efficiency for network expressivity and stronger resistance to optimization challenges like plasticity loss and gradient interference. We further extend our evaluation to visual and streaming RL scenarios, demonstrating the consistent benefits of network sparsity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Confidence Scoring for LLM-Generated SQL in Supply Chain Data Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17203v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently enabled natural language interfaces that translate user queries into executable SQL, offering a powerful solution for non-technical stakeholders to access structured data. However, one of the limitation that LLMs do not natively express uncertainty makes it difficult to assess the reliability of their generated queries. This paper presents a case study that evaluates multiple approaches to estimate confidence scores for LLM-generated SQL in supply chain data retrieval. We investigated three strategies: (1) translation-based consistency checks; (2) embedding-based semantic similarity between user questions and generated SQL; and (3) self-reported confidence scores directly produced by the LLM. Our findings reveal that LLMs are often overconfident in their own outputs, which limits the effectiveness of self-reported confidence. In contrast, embedding-based similarity methods demonstrate strong discriminative power in identifying inaccurate SQL.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by KDD workshop AI for Supply Chain 2025</p></details> |
| **[UniFork: Exploring Modality Alignment for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17202v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified image understanding and generation has emerged as a promising paradigm in multimodal artificial intelligence. Despite recent progress, the optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge. In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation: understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference. This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization. Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures, and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/tliby/UniFork</p></details> |
| **[Hunyuan-GameCraft: High-dynamic Interactive Game Video Generation with Hybrid History Condition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17201v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based and controllable video generation have enabled high-quality and temporally coherent video synthesis, laying the groundwork for immersive interactive gaming experiences. However, current methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games, ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of interactive game video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hunyuan-gamecraft.github.io/</p></details> |

Among them, generative models have emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling the efficient creation of diverse and physically plausible demonstrations. In this paper, we introduce Dex1B, a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality demonstration dataset produced with generative models. The dataset contains one billion demonstrations for two fundamental tasks: grasping and articulation. To construct it, we propose a generative model that integrates geometric constraints to improve feasibility and applies additional conditions to enhance diversity. We validate the model on both established and newly introduced simulation benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness through real-world robot experiments.

| **[Schrödinger Bridge Matching for Tree-Structured Costs and Entropic Wasserstein Barycentres](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17197v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in flow-based generative modelling have provided scalable methods for computing the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) between distributions, a dynamic form of entropy-regularised Optimal Transport (OT) for the quadratic cost. The successful Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF) procedure solves the SB problem via sequential bridge-matching steps, presenting an elegant and practical approach with many favourable properties over the more traditional Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure. Beyond the standard setting, optimal transport can be generalised to the multi-marginal case in which the objective is to minimise a cost defined over several marginal distributions. Of particular importance are costs defined over a tree structure, from which Wasserstein barycentres can be recovered as a special case. In this work, we extend the IMF procedure to solve for the tree-structured SB problem. Our resulting algorithm inherits the many advantages of IMF over IPF approaches in the tree-based setting. In the specific case of Wasserstein barycentres, our approach can be viewed as extending fixed-point approaches for barycentre computation to the case of flow-based entropic OT solvers.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Detecting LLM-Generated Short Answers and Effects on Learner Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17196v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing availability of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their potential misuse in online learning. While tools for detecting LLM-generated text exist and are widely used by researchers and educators, their reliability varies. Few studies have compared the accuracy of detection methods, defined criteria to identify content generated by LLM, or evaluated the effect on learner performance from LLM misuse within learning. In this study, we define LLM-generated text within open responses as those produced by any LLM without paraphrasing or refinement, as evaluated by human coders. We then fine-tune GPT-4o to detect LLM-generated responses and assess the impact on learning from LLM misuse. We find that our fine-tuned LLM outperforms the existing AI detection tool GPTZero, achieving an accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 0.78, compared to GPTZero's accuracy of 70% and macro F1 score of 0.50, demonstrating superior performance in detecting LLM-generated responses. We also find that learners suspected of LLM misuse in the open response question were more than twice as likely to correctly answer the corresponding posttest MCQ, suggesting potential misuse across both question types and indicating a bypass of the learning process. We pave the way for future work by demonstrating a structured, code-based approach to improve LLM-generated response detection and propose using auxiliary statistical indicators such as unusually high assessment scores on related tasks, readability scores, and response duration. In support of open science, we contribute data and code to support the fine-tuning of similar models for similar use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 19th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning (ECTEL 2025).

| **[Facial Landmark Visualization and Emotion Recognition Through Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17191v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotion recognition from facial images is a crucial task in human-computer interaction, enabling machines to learn human emotions through facial expressions. Previous studies have shown that facial images can be used to train deep learning models; however, most of these studies do not include a through dataset analysis. Visualizing facial landmarks can be challenging when extracting meaningful dataset insights; to address this issue, we propose facial landmark box plots, a visualization technique designed to identify outliers in facial datasets. Additionally, we compare two sets of facial landmark features: (i) the landmarks' absolute positions and (ii) their displacements from a neutral expression to the peak of an emotional expression. Our results indicate that a neural network achieves better performance than a random forest classifier.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best paper Award COMIA 2025</p></details> |

To build on this progress, however, the robotics community needs common tooling for prototyping, evaluating, and deploying sampling-based controllers. We introduce Judo, a software package designed to address this need. To facilitate rapid prototyping and evaluation, Judo provides robust implementations of common sampling-based MPC algorithms and standardized benchmark tasks. It further emphasizes usability with simple but extensible interfaces for controller and task definitions, asynchronous execution for straightforward simulation-to-hardware transfer, and a highly customizable interactive GUI for tuning controllers interactively. While written in Python, the software leverages MuJoCo as its physics backend to achieve real-time performance, which we validate across both consumer and server-grade hardware.

Despite the apparent differences in architecture and training methodologies among various types of generative models - autoencoders, autoregressive models, generative adversarial networks, normalizing flows, diffusion models, and flow matching - we demonstrate that they all fundamentally operate by transforming simple predefined distributions into complex target data distributions. This unifying perspective facilitates the transfer of methodological improvements between model architectures and provides a foundation for developing universal theoretical approaches, potentially leading to more efficient and effective generative modeling techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in "ICIST 2025 Springer Proceedings"</p></details> |

Using CoLaNET (Columnar Layered Network), we show that microcolumns adapt most efficiently to new tasks when they lack shared structure with prior learning. We demonstrate how CoLaNET hyperparameters govern the trade-off between retaining old knowledge (stability) and acquiring new information (plasticity). Our optimal configuration learns ten sequential MNIST tasks effectively, maintaining 92% accuracy on each. It shows low forgetting, with only 4% performance degradation on the first task after training on nine subsequent tasks.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

This study explores how different ratios of GAN-generated and real brain tumor MRI images impact the performance of a CNN in classifying healthy vs. tumorous scans. A DCGAN was used to create synthetic images which were mixed with real ones at various ratios to train a custom CNN. The CNN was then evaluated on a separate real-world test set. Our results indicate that the model maintains high sensitivity and precision in tumor classification, even when trained predominantly on synthetic data. When only a small portion of GAN data was added, such as 900 real images and 100 GAN images, the model achieved excellent performance, with test accuracy reaching 95.2%, and precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 95%. However, as the proportion of GAN images increased further, performance gradually declined. This study suggests that while GANs are useful for augmenting limited datasets especially when real data is scarce, too much synthetic data can introduce artifacts that affect the model's ability to generalize to real world cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This papaer has been submitted to The 18th International Conference on Brain Informatics (BI'25), Italy</p></details> |
| **[LLMs and Stack Overflow Discussions: Reliability, Impact, and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08801v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow, the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way, we aim to (i) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (ii) identify and understand why LLMs fail; (iii) measure users activity evolution with Stack Overflow over time; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal: ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise, yet do not outperform it for some domains, while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore, we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs and provide guidelines for future challenges faced by users and researchers.</p></details> | 63 pages, 11 figures |

While machine learning-based PDF malware classifiers have shown promise, these classifiers are often susceptible to adversarial attacks, undermining their reliability. To address this issue, recent studies have aimed to enhance the robustness of PDF classifiers. Despite these efforts, the feature engineering underlying these studies remains outdated. Consequently, even with the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques, these approaches fail to fundamentally resolve the issue of feature instability. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for PDF feature extraction and PDF malware detection. We introduce the PDFObj IR (PDF Object Intermediate Representation), an assembly-like language framework for PDF objects, from which we extract semantic features using a pretrained language model. Additionally, we construct an Object Reference Graph to capture structural features, drawing inspiration from program analysis. This dual approach enables us to analyze and detect PDF malware based on both semantic and structural features. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed classifier achieves strong adversarial robustness while maintaining an exceptionally low false positive rate of only 0.07% on baseline dataset compared to state-of-the-art PDF malware classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

The method consists of three steps: (1) using Adaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation (ADEPT), a highly specific method to identify walking; (2) transforming the accelerometry time series into an image that corresponds to the joint distribution of the time series and its lags; and (3) using the resulting images to construct a person-specific walking fingerprint. The method is applied to 15,000 individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with up to 7 days of wrist accelerometry data collected at 80 Hertz. The resulting dataset contains more than 10 terabytes, is roughly 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets used for activity recognition, is collected in the free living environment, and does not contain labels for walking periods. Using extensive cross-validation studies, we show that our method is highly predictive and can be successfully extended to a large, heterogeneous sample representative of the U.S. population: in the highest-performing model, the correct participant is in the top 1% of predictions 96% of the time.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Minimalist Method for Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12036v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune text-to-image diffusion models, improving text-image alignment and sample quality. However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Do We Need Large VLMs for Spotting Soccer Actions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17144v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional video-based tasks like soccer action spotting rely heavily on visual inputs, often requiring complex and computationally expensive models to process dense video data. In this work, we propose a shift from this video-centric approach to a text-based task, making it lightweight and scalable by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) instead of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We posit that expert commentary, which provides rich, fine-grained descriptions and contextual cues such as excitement and tactical insights, contains enough information to reliably spot key actions in a match. To demonstrate this, we use the SoccerNet Echoes dataset, which provides timestamped commentary, and employ a system of three LLMs acting as judges specializing in outcome, excitement, and tactics. Each LLM evaluates sliding windows of commentary to identify actions like goals, cards, and substitutions, generating accurate timestamps for these events. Our experiments show that this language-centric approach performs effectively in detecting critical match events, providing a lightweight and training-free alternative to traditional video-based methods for action spotting.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[The fundamental problem of risk prediction for individuals: health AI, uncertainty, and personalized medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17141v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Clinical prediction models for a health condition are commonly evaluated regarding performance for a population, although decisions are made for individuals. The classic view relates uncertainty in risk estimates for individuals to sample size (estimation uncertainty) but uncertainty can also be caused by model uncertainty (variability in modeling choices) and applicability uncertainty (variability in measurement procedures and between populations). Methods: We used real and synthetic data for ovarian cancer diagnosis to train 59400 models with variations in estimation, model, and applicability uncertainty. We then used these models to estimate the probability of ovarian cancer in a fixed test set of 100 patients and evaluate the variability in individual estimates. Findings: We show empirically that estimation uncertainty can be strongly dominated by model uncertainty and applicability uncertainty, even for models that perform well at the population level. Estimation uncertainty decreased considerably with increasing training sample size, whereas model and applicability uncertainty remained large. Interpretation: Individual risk estimates are far more uncertain than often assumed. Model uncertainty and applicability uncertainty usually remain invisible when prediction models or algorithms are based on a single study. Predictive algorithms should inform, not dictate, care and support personalization through clinician-patient interaction rather than through inherently uncertain model outputs.

| **[On the Theory of Conditional Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain-Adaptive Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17137v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object counting models suffer when deployed across domains with differing density variety, since density shifts are inherently task-relevant and violate standard domain adaptation assumptions. To address this, we propose a theoretical framework of conditional feature alignment. We first formalize the notion of conditional divergence by partitioning each domain into subsets (e.g., object vs. background) and measuring divergences per condition. We then derive a joint error bound showing that, under discrete label spaces treated as condition sets, aligning distributions conditionally leads to tighter bounds on the combined source-target decision error than unconditional alignment. These insights motivate a general conditional adaptation principle: by preserving task-relevant variations while filtering out nuisance shifts, one can achieve superior cross-domain generalization for counting. We provide both defining conditional divergence then proving its benefit in lowering joint error and a practical adaptation strategy that preserves task-relevant information in unsupervised domain-adaptive counting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on multiple counting datasets with varying density distributions. The results show that our method outperforms existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods, empirically validating the theoretical insights on conditional feature alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

Recent breakthroughs in open-source large language models (LLMs) have opened up a new avenue in generating labeled datasets automatically for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, providing an alternative to such an expensive annotation process. However, the reliability of such auto-generated labels remains a significant concern due to inherent inaccuracies. When learning from noisy labels, the model's generalization is likely to be harmed as it is prone to overfit to those label noises. While previous studies in learning from noisy labels mainly focus on synthetic noise and real-world noise, LLM-generated label noise receives less attention. In this paper, we propose SiDyP: Simplex Label Diffusion with Dynamic Prior to calibrate the classifier's prediction, thus enhancing its robustness towards LLM-generated noisy labels. SiDyP retrieves potential true label candidates by neighborhood label distribution in text embedding space and iteratively refines noisy candidates using a simplex diffusion model. Our framework can increase the performance of the BERT classifier fine-tuned on both zero-shot and few-shot LLM-generated noisy label datasets by an average of 7.21% and 7.30% respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SiDyP by conducting extensive benchmarking for different LLMs over a variety of NLP tasks. Our code is available on Github.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD'25 |

The emergence of "thinking" through model-free RL is interesting as thinking actions neither produce reward nor change the external world state to one where the agent is more likely to get reward. This paper seeks to build a domain-independent understanding of when model-free RL will lead to "thinking" as a strategy for reward maximization. To build this understanding, we first introduce a theoretical model which we call a \textit{thought Markov decision process} (MDP). Thought MDPs minimally extend the classical MDP model to include an abstract notion of thought state and thought action. Using the thought MDP model, we prove the importance of policy initialization in determining whether or not thinking emerges and show formally that thought actions are equivalent to the agent choosing to perform a step of policy improvement before continuing to act. We then show that open-source LLMs satisfy the conditions that our theory predicts are necessary for model-free RL to produce thinking-like behavior. Finally, we hypothesize sufficient conditions that would enable thinking to be learned outside of language generation and introduce a toy domain where a combination of multi-task pre-training and designated thought actions enable more data-efficient RL compared to non-thinking agents.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods -- *post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future development to minimize the KV footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release our code publicly at https://github.com/princeton-pli/PruLong</p></details> |

CAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing, detecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a complex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced relationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large software systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of patterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the challenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied automated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon hand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different features (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly characterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations. Recently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable efficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship attribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness in CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive empirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller code LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code snippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine learning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate important findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding stylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important directions for future work.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.

For instance, medical diagnosis requires precise reasoning over structured clinical tables, while financial forecasting depends on interpreting plot-based data to make informed predictions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce MEXA, a training-free framework that performs modality- and task-aware aggregation of multiple expert models to enable effective multimodal reasoning across diverse and distinct domains. MEXA dynamically selects expert models based on the input modality and the task-specific reasoning demands (i.e., skills). Each expert model, specialized in a modality task pair, generates interpretable textual reasoning outputs. MEXA then aggregates and reasons over these outputs using a Large Reasoning Model (LRM) to produce the final answer. This modular design allows flexible and transparent multimodal reasoning across diverse domains without additional training overhead. We extensively evaluate our approach on diverse multimodal benchmarks, including Video Reasoning, Audio Reasoning, 3D Understanding, and Medical QA. MEXA consistently delivers performance improvements over strong multimodal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness and broad applicability of our expert-driven selection and aggregation in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally; Github link: https://github.com/Yui010206/MEXA</p></details> |

At present, 6D pose estimation for robotic manipulation generally relies on depth sensors based on, e.g., structured light, time-of-flight, and stereo-vision, which can be expensive, produce noisy output (as compared with RGB cameras), and fail to handle transparent objects. On the other hand, state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models (MDEMs) provide only affine-invariant depths up to an unknown scale and shift. Metric MDEMs achieve some successful zero-shot results on public datasets, but fail to generalize. We propose a novel framework, Monocular One-shot Metric-depth Alignment (MOMA), to recover metric depth from a single RGB image, through a one-shot adaptation building on MDEM techniques. MOMA performs scale-rotation-shift alignments during camera calibration, guided by sparse ground-truth depth points, enabling accurate depth estimation without additional data collection or model retraining on the testing setup. MOMA supports fine-tuning the MDEM on transparent objects, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities. Real-world experiments on tabletop 2-finger grasping and suction-based bin-picking applications show MOMA achieves high success rates in diverse tasks, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

At each time t, normal processes are in state zero (normal state), while the abnormal process may be in either state zero (normal state) or state one (abnormal state), with the states being hidden. The transition between states for the abnormal process is governed by a Markov chain over time. At each time step, observations can be drawn from a selected subset of processes. Each probed process generates an observation depending on its hidden state, either a typical distribution under state zero or an abnormal distribution under state one. The objective is to design a sequential search strategy that minimizes the expected detection time, subject to an error probability constraint. In contrast to prior works that assume i.i.d. observations, we address a new setting where anomalies evolve according to a hidden Markov model. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm, dubbed Anomaly Detection under Hidden Markov model (ADHM), which dynamically adapts the probing strategy based on accumulated statistical evidence and predictive belief updates over hidden states. ADHM effectively leverages temporal correlations to focus sensing resources on the most informative processes. The algorithm is supported by an asymptotic theoretical foundation, grounded in an oracle analysis that characterizes the fundamental limits of detection under the assumption of a known distribution of the hidden states. In addition, the algorithm demonstrates strong empirical performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in extensive simulations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Yet, a fundamental question persists: how do these models internally establish and represent temporal correspondences across frames? We introduce DiffTrack, the first quantitative analysis framework designed to answer this question. DiffTrack constructs a dataset of prompt-generated video with pseudo ground-truth tracking annotations and proposes novel evaluation metrics to systematically analyze how each component within the full 3D attention mechanism of DiTs (e.g., representations, layers, and timesteps) contributes to establishing temporal correspondences. Our analysis reveals that query-key similarities in specific, but not all, layers play a critical role in temporal matching, and that this matching becomes increasingly prominent during the denoising process. We demonstrate practical applications of DiffTrack in zero-shot point tracking, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing vision foundation and self-supervised video models. Further, we extend our findings to motion-enhanced video generation with a novel guidance method that improves temporal consistency of generated videos without additional training. We believe our work offers crucial insights into the inner workings of video DiTs and establishes a foundation for further research and applications leveraging their temporal understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https:/cvlab-kaist.github.io/DiffTrack</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, the optimal architectural design for such unified models remains an open challenge. In this work, we start by analyzing the modality alignment behaviors of task-specific expert models for understanding and generation, as well as current unified models. Our analysis reveals a crucial observation: understanding tasks benefit from a progressively increasing modality alignment across network depth, which helps build up semantic information for better comprehension; In contrast, generation tasks follow a different trend: modality alignment increases in the early layers but decreases in the deep layers to recover spatial details. These divergent alignment patterns create a fundamental conflict in fully shared Transformer backbones, where a uniform representational flow often leads to performance compromises across two tasks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce UniFork, a novel Y-shaped architecture that shares the shallow layers for cross-task representation learning, while employing task-specific branches in deeper layers to avoid task interference. This design effectively balances shared learning and task specialization. Through extensive ablation experiments, we demonstrate that Unifork consistently outperforms conventional fully shared Transformer architectures, and achieves performance on par with or better than task-specific models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/tliby/UniFork</p></details> |

The method consists of three steps: (1) using Adaptive Empirical Pattern Transformation (ADEPT), a highly specific method to identify walking; (2) transforming the accelerometry time series into an image that corresponds to the joint distribution of the time series and its lags; and (3) using the resulting images to construct a person-specific walking fingerprint. The method is applied to 15,000 individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) with up to 7 days of wrist accelerometry data collected at 80 Hertz. The resulting dataset contains more than 10 terabytes, is roughly 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets used for activity recognition, is collected in the free living environment, and does not contain labels for walking periods. Using extensive cross-validation studies, we show that our method is highly predictive and can be successfully extended to a large, heterogeneous sample representative of the U.S. population: in the highest-performing model, the correct participant is in the top 1% of predictions 96% of the time.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

To address the challenge, we propose a Conditioned One-Shot fine-tuning framework (COS-DPO) that extends the Direct Preference Optimization technique, originally developed for efficient LLM alignment with preference data, to accommodate the MOFT settings. By direct conditioning on the weight across auxiliary objectives, our Weight-COS-DPO method enjoys an efficient one-shot training process for profiling the Pareto front and is capable of achieving comprehensive trade-off solutions even in the post-training stage. Based on our theoretical findings on the linear transformation properties of the loss function, we further propose the Temperature-COS-DPO method that augments the temperature parameter to the model input, enhancing the flexibility of post-training control over the trade-offs between the main and auxiliary objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the COS-DPO framework through its applications to various tasks, including the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) and LLM alignment tasks, highlighting its viability for large-scale ML deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at UAI 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces MAWIFlow, a flow-based benchmark derived from the MAWILAB v1.1 dataset, designed to enable realistic and reproducible evaluation of anomaly detection methods. A reproducible preprocessing pipeline is presented that transforms raw packet captures into flow representations conforming to the CICFlowMeter format, while preserving MAWILab's original anomaly labels. The resulting datasets comprise temporally distinct samples from January 2011, 2016, and 2021, drawn from trans-Pacific backbone traffic. To establish reference baselines, traditional machine learning methods, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, are compared to a deep learning model based on a CNN-BiLSTM architecture. Empirical results demonstrate that tree-based classifiers perform well on temporally static data but experience significant performance degradation over time. In contrast, the CNN-BiLSTM model maintains better performance, thus showing improved generalization. These findings underscore the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and static models, and motivate the adoption of realistic datasets with explicit temporal structure. All datasets, pipeline code, and model implementations are made publicly available to foster transparency and reproducibility.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively. Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |

This unified framework is achieved by a specially structured neural network -- the Belted and Ensembled Neural Network (BENN) -- that consists of a narrow latent layer, which we call the belt, and a family of transformations of the response, which we call the ensemble. By strategically placing the belt at different layers of the neural network, we can achieve linear or nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction, and by choosing the appropriate transformation families, we can achieve dimension reduction for the conditional distribution or the conditional mean. Moreover, thanks to the advantage of the neural network, the method is very fast to compute, overcoming a computation bottleneck of the traditional sufficient dimension reduction estimators, which involves the inversion of a matrix of dimension either p or n. We develop the algorithm and convergence rate of our method, compare it with existing sufficient dimension reduction methods, and apply it to two data examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[RocketStack: A level-aware deep recursive ensemble learning framework with exploratory feature fusion and model pruning dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16965v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model. However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE) filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class), linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached 98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression.

| **[Reversing Flow for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16961v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded low-quality (LQ) ones by reversing the effects of degradation. Existing generative models for image restoration, including diffusion and score-based models, often treat the degradation process as a stochastic transformation, which introduces inefficiency and complexity. In this work, we propose ResFlow, a novel image restoration framework that models the degradation process as a deterministic path using continuous normalizing flows. ResFlow augments the degradation process with an auxiliary process that disambiguates the uncertainty in HQ prediction to enable reversible modeling of the degradation process. ResFlow adopts entropy-preserving flow paths and learns the augmented degradation flow by matching the velocity field. ResFlow significantly improves the performance and speed of image restoration, completing the task in fewer than four sampling steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResFlow achieves state-of-the-art results across various image restoration benchmarks, offering a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Final Version; Corresponding Author: Bing Li</p></details> |

Improving model robustness requires high-quality signals from robustness benchmarks to quantify progress. While various benchmark datasets such as ImageNet-C were proposed in the ImageNet era, most ImageNet-C corruption types are no longer OOD relative to today's large, web-scraped datasets, which already contain common corruptions such as blur or JPEG compression artifacts. Consequently, these benchmarks are no longer well-suited for evaluating OOD robustness in the era of web-scale datasets. Indeed, recent models show saturating scores on ImageNet-era OOD benchmarks, indicating that it is unclear whether models trained on web-scale datasets truly become better at OOD generalization or whether they have simply been exposed to the test distortions during training. To address this, we introduce LAION-C as a benchmark alternative for ImageNet-C. LAION-C consists of six novel distortion types specifically designed to be OOD, even for web-scale datasets such as LAION. In a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models, we find that the LAION-C dataset poses significant challenges to contemporary models, including MLLMs such as Gemini and GPT-4o. We additionally conducted a psychophysical experiment to evaluate the difficulty of our corruptions for human observers, enabling a comparison of models to lab-quality human robustness data. We observe a paradigm shift in OOD generalization: from humans outperforming models, to the best models now matching or outperforming the best human observers.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 camera ready version</p></details> |

These tasks often involve selecting one location from each of several target clusters, forming a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) that remains challenging to solve both accurately and efficiently. To address this, we propose a Multimodal Fused Learning (MMFL) framework that leverages both graph and image-based representations to capture complementary aspects of the problem, and learns a policy capable of generating high-quality task planning schemes in real time. Specifically, we first introduce a coordinate-based image builder that transforms GTSP instances into spatially informative representations. We then design an adaptive resolution scaling strategy to enhance adaptability across different problem scales, and develop a multimodal fusion module with dedicated bottlenecks that enables effective integration of geometric and spatial features. Extensive experiments show that our MMFL approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various GTSP instances while maintaining the computational efficiency required for real-time robotic applications. Physical robot tests further validate its practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional approaches to extracting information from VRDs rely heavily on expert knowledge and manual annotation, making them labor-intensive and inefficient. Recent advances in deep learning have transformed this landscape by enabling multimodal models that integrate vision, language, and layout features through pretraining, significantly improving information extraction performance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of deep learning-based frameworks for VRD Content Understanding (VRD-CU). We categorize existing methods based on their modeling strategies and downstream tasks, and provide a comparative analysis of key components, including feature representation, fusion techniques, model architectures, and pretraining objectives. Additionally, we highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach and discuss their suitability for different applications. The paper concludes with a discussion of current challenges and emerging trends, offering guidance for future research and practical deployment in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

While a related task, audio fingerprinting, has made significant progress in accurately retrieving musical content under "real world" (noisy, reverberant) conditions, ASID systems struggle to identify samples that have undergone musical modifications. Thus, a system robust to common music production transformations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, effects processing, and underlying or overlaying music is an important open challenge. In this work, we propose a lightweight and scalable encoding architecture employing a Graph Neural Network within a contrastive learning framework. Our model uses only 9% of the trainable parameters compared to the current state-of-the-art system while achieving comparable performance, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 44.2%. To enhance retrieval quality, we introduce a two-stage approach consisting of an initial coarse similarity search for candidate selection, followed by a cross-attention classifier that rejects irrelevant matches and refines the ranking of retrieved candidates - an essential capability absent in prior models. In addition, because queries in real-world applications are often short in duration, we benchmark our system for short queries using new fine-grained annotations for the Sample100 dataset, which we publish as part of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) 2025</p></details> |

When passing from plain solving to enumeration, however, the capability of producing partial satisfying assignments that are as small as possible becomes crucial, which raises the question of whether such CNF encodings are also effective for enumeration. In this paper, we investigate both theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of CNF conversions for SAT and SMT enumeration. On the negative side, we show that: (i) Tseitin transformation prevents the solver from producing short partial assignments, thus seriously affecting the effectiveness of enumeration; (ii) Plaisted and Greenbaum transformation overcomes this problem only in part. On the positive side, we prove theoretically and we show empirically that combining Plaisted and Greenbaum transformation with NNF preprocessing upfront -- which is typically not used in solving -- can fully overcome the problem and can drastically reduce both the number of partial assignments and the execution time.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. 26 pages, 4 figures (48 pages, 19 figures with appendix)</p></details> |

We analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from this construction ($\phi = I$), concluding that they always result in the logical identity. An immediate application of these codes in dealing with coherent noise is discussed. We then develop a new doubling transformation for obtaining triorthogonal codes, which generalizes the doubling construction presented in [2].

Building on this system representation, we design an adaptive nonlinear control algorithm that takes advantage of the properties of the new system geometry and assumes that the target follows a constant acceleration model.

However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets, outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

While existing methods primarily focus on developing model structures and building graphs for improved selection, pre-training strategies remain underexplored in this domain. Current stock series pre-training follows methods from other areas without adapting to the unique characteristics of financial data, particularly overlooking stock-specific contextual information and the non-stationary nature of stock prices. Consequently, the latent statistical features inherent in stock data are underutilized. In this paper, we propose three novel pre-training tasks tailored to stock data characteristics: stock code classification, stock sector classification, and moving average prediction. We develop the Stock Specialized Pre-trained Transformer (SSPT) based on a two-layer transformer architecture. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pre-training methods and provide detailed guidance on their application. Evaluations on five stock datasets, including four markets and two time periods, demonstrate that SSPT consistently outperforms the market and existing methods in terms of both cumulative investment return ratio and Sharpe ratio. Additionally, our experiments on simulated data investigate the underlying mechanisms of our methods, providing insights into understanding price series.

To mitigate the malicious abuse of diffusion models, diffusion-generated image detection has proven to be an effective countermeasure.However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer, forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing detection capabilities for diffusion-generated images.

Recent empirical evidence shows that many existing neural architectures, including Transformers, struggle with tasks requiring relational reasoning. In this work, we distinguish between two types of information: sensory information about the properties of individual objects, and relational information about the relationships between objects. While neural attention provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the flow of sensory information between objects, the Transformer lacks an explicit computational mechanism for routing and processing relational information. To address this limitation, we propose an architectural extension of the Transformer framework that we call the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), featuring two distinct attention mechanisms: sensory attention for directing the flow of sensory information, and a novel relational attention mechanism for directing the flow of relational information. We empirically evaluate DAT on a diverse set of tasks ranging from synthetic relational benchmarks to complex real-world tasks such as language modeling and visual processing. Our results demonstrate that integrating explicit relational computational mechanisms into the Transformer architecture leads to significant performance gains in terms of data efficiency and parameter efficiency.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

However, current methods face limitations in dynamics, generality, long-term consistency, and efficiency, which limit the ability to create various gameplay videos. To address these gaps, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft, a novel framework for high-dynamic interactive video generation in game environments. To achieve fine-grained action control, we unify standard keyboard and mouse inputs into a shared camera representation space, facilitating smooth interpolation between various camera and movement operations. Then we propose a hybrid history-conditioned training strategy that extends video sequences autoregressively while preserving game scene information. Additionally, to enhance inference efficiency and playability, we achieve model distillation to reduce computational overhead while maintaining consistency across long temporal sequences, making it suitable for real-time deployment in complex interactive environments. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset comprising over one million gameplay recordings across over 100 AAA games, ensuring broad coverage and diversity, then fine-tuned on a carefully annotated synthetic dataset to enhance precision and control. The curated game scene data significantly improves the visual fidelity, realism and action controllability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hunyuan-GameCraft significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the realism and playability of interactive game video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hunyuan-gamecraft.github.io/</p></details> |

However, existing approaches introduce unnecessary complexity: they cache the full sampling trajectory, depend on differentiable reward models or large preference datasets, or require specialized guidance techniques. Motivated by the "golden noise" hypothesis -- that certain initial noise samples can consistently yield superior alignment -- we introduce Noise PPO, a minimalist RL algorithm that leaves the pre-trained diffusion model entirely frozen and learns a prompt-conditioned initial noise generator. Our approach requires no trajectory storage, reward backpropagation, or complex guidance tricks. Extensive experiments show that optimizing the initial noise distribution consistently improves alignment and sample quality over the original model, with the most significant gains at low inference steps. As the number of inference steps increases, the benefit of noise optimization diminishes but remains present. These findings clarify the scope and limitations of the golden noise hypothesis and reinforce the practical value of minimalist RL fine-tuning for diffusion models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding.

Many prior works have proposed ways of discarding KVs from memory, but their approaches are tailored to favorable settings, obscuring caveats like high peak memory and performance degradation, and a fair comparison between methods is difficult. In this paper, we propose the *KV footprint* as a unified metric, which accounts for both the amount of KV entries stored and their lifespan in memory. We evaluate methods based on the smallest footprint they attain while preserving performance in both long-context understanding and generation, with context lengths of up to 128K tokens. This metric reveals the high peak memory of prior KV eviction methods. One class of methods -- *post-fill eviction* -- has a high footprint due to being incompatible with eviction during pre-filling. We adapt these methods to be able to evict KVs during pre-filling, achieving substantially lower KV footprints. We then turn to *recency eviction* methods, wherein we propose PruLong, an end-to-end optimization method for learning which attention heads need to retain the full KV cache and which do not. PruLong saves memory while preserving long-context performance, achieving 12% smaller KV footprint than prior methods while retaining performance in challenging recall tasks. Our paper clarifies the complex tangle of long-context inference methods and paves the way for future development to minimize the KV footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release our code publicly at https://github.com/princeton-pli/PruLong</p></details> |

Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery.

However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint. To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables.

While existing feature visualization approaches typically infer a unit's most exciting images, this is insufficient to reveal the manifold of transformations under which responses remain invariant, which is key to generalization in vision. Here we introduce Stretch-and-Squeeze (SnS), an unbiased, model-agnostic, and gradient-free framework to systematically characterize a unit's invariance landscape and its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations in both biological and artificial visual systems. SnS frames these transformations as bi-objective optimization problems. To probe invariance, SnS seeks image perturbations that maximally alter the representation of a reference stimulus in a given processing stage while preserving unit activation. To probe adversarial sensitivity, SnS seeks perturbations that minimally alter the stimulus while suppressing unit activation. Applied to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SnS revealed image variations that were further from a reference image in pixel-space than those produced by affine transformations, while more strongly preserving the target unit's response. The discovered invariant images differed dramatically depending on the choice of image representation used for optimization: pixel-level changes primarily affected luminance and contrast, while stretching mid- and late-layer CNN representations altered texture and pose respectively. Notably, the invariant images from robust networks were more recognizable by human subjects than those from standard networks, supporting the higher fidelity of robust CNNs as models of the visual system.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

Many methods operate on the frequency-domain, relying on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which assumes uniform sampling, therefore requiring prior interpolation that can distort the spectra. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable Lomb--Scargle layer that enables a reliable computation of the power spectrum of irregularly sampled data. We integrate this layer into a novel score-based diffusion model (LSCD) for time series imputation conditioned on the entire signal spectrum. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method recovers missing data more accurately than purely time-domain baselines, while simultaneously producing consistent frequency estimates. Crucially, our method can be easily integrated into learning frameworks, enabling broader adoption of spectral guidance in machine learning approaches involving incomplete or irregular data.</p></details> | In ICML 2025 |
| **[Conditional Front-door Adjustment for Heterogeneous Treatment Assignment Effect Estimation Under Non-adherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05677v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-adherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Eau De $Q$-Network: Adaptive Distillation of Neural Networks in Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01437v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have successfully demonstrated that sparse deep reinforcement learning agents can be competitive against their dense counterparts. This opens up opportunities for reinforcement learning applications in fields where inference time and memory requirements are cost-sensitive or limited by hardware. Until now, dense-to-sparse methods have relied on hand-designed sparsity schedules that are not synchronized with the agent's learning pace. Crucially, the final sparsity level is chosen as a hyperparameter, which requires careful tuning as setting it too high might lead to poor performances. In this work, we address these shortcomings by crafting a dense-to-sparse algorithm that we name Eau De $Q$-Network (EauDeQN). To increase sparsity at the agent's learning pace, we consider multiple online networks with different sparsity levels, where each online network is trained from a shared target network. At each target update, the online network with the smallest loss is chosen as the next target network, while the other networks are replaced by a pruned version of the chosen network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the Atari $2600$ benchmark and the MuJoCo physics simulator, showing that EauDeQN reaches high sparsity levels while keeping performances high.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at RLC 2025: https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bb84iBj4wU#discussion</p></details> |
| **[Belted and Ensembled Neural Network for Linear and Nonlinear Sufficient Dimension Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08961v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a unified, flexible, and easy-to-implement framework of sufficient dimension reduction that can accommodate both linear and nonlinear dimension reduction, and both the conditional distribution and the conditional mean as the targets of estimation. This unified framework is achieved by a specially structured neural network -- the Belted and Ensembled Neural Network (BENN) -- that consists of a narrow latent layer, which we call the belt, and a family of transformations of the response, which we call the ensemble. By strategically placing the belt at different layers of the neural network, we can achieve linear or nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction, and by choosing the appropriate transformation families, we can achieve dimension reduction for the conditional distribution or the conditional mean. Moreover, thanks to the advantage of the neural network, the method is very fast to compute, overcoming a computation bottleneck of the traditional sufficient dimension reduction estimators, which involves the inversion of a matrix of dimension either p or n. We develop the algorithm and convergence rate of our method, compare it with existing sufficient dimension reduction methods, and apply it to two data examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, DSI requires full re-training to index new documents, causing significant computational inefficiencies. Continual learning (CL) offers a solution by enabling the model to incrementally update without full re-training. Existing CL solutions in document retrieval rely on memory buffers or generative models for rehearsal, which is infeasible when accessing previous training data is restricted due to privacy concerns. To this end, we introduce PromptDSI, a prompt-based, rehearsal-free continual learning approach for document retrieval. PromptDSI follows the Prompt-based Continual Learning (PCL) framework, using learnable prompts to efficiently index new documents without accessing previous documents or queries. To improve retrieval latency, we remove the initial forward pass of PCL, which otherwise greatly increases training and inference time, with a negligible trade-off in performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel topic-aware prompt pool that employs neural topic embeddings as fixed keys, eliminating the instability of prompt key optimization while maintaining competitive performance with existing PCL prompt pools. In a challenging rehearsal-free continual learning setup, we demonstrate that PromptDSI variants outperform rehearsal-based baselines, match the strong cache-based baseline in mitigating forgetting, and significantly improving retrieval performance on new corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECML ...</summary><p>ECML PKDD 2025 Research track.

While hypergraphs preserve the intrinsic nature of such complex relationships, existing models often overlook temporal evolution in relational data. To address this, we introduce a first-order autoregressive (i.e. AR(1)) model for dynamic non-uniform hypergraphs. This is the first dynamic hypergraph model with provable theoretical guarantees, explicitly defining the temporal evolution of hyperedge presence through transition probabilities that govern persistence and change dynamics. This framework provides closed-form expressions for key probabilistic properties and facilitates straightforward maximum-likelihood inference with uniform error bounds and asymptotic normality, along with a permutation-based diagnostic test. We also consider an AR(1) hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM), where a novel Laplacian enables exact and efficient latent community recovery via a spectral clustering algorithm. Furthermore, we develop a likelihood-based change-point estimator for the HSBM to detect structural breaks within the time series. The efficacy and practical value of our methods are comprehensively demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and compelling applications to a primary school interaction data set and the Enron email corpus, revealing insightful community structures and significant temporal changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2010.04492</p></details> |
| **[RocketStack: A level-aware deep recursive ensemble learning framework with exploratory feature fusion and model pruning dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16965v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model. However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE) filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class), linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached 98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression. These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive ensembling with tractable complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 1 graphical abstract, 7 figures, 9 tables, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |

The scarcity of real interview data, absence of structured variable modeling, and lack of interpretability in inference mechanisms have limited the analytical accuracy and policy responsiveness of EII research. To resolve these challenges, we propose a structural modeling paradigm based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) synthetic data quality framework, focusing on consistency, authenticity, and traceability. We design a five-layer architecture that includes prompt-driven synthetic dialogue generation, a structured variable system covering skills, institutional, and emotional dimensions, dependency and causal path modeling, graph-based structure design, and an interactive inference engine. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a 15-segment synthetic corpus, with 41,597 tokens, 127 annotated variables, and 820 semantic relationship triples. The model exhibits strong structural consistency (Krippendorff alpha = 0.83), construct validity (RMSEA = 0.048, CFI = 0.93), and semantic alignment (mean cosine similarity > 0.78 via BERT). A key causal loop is identified: system mismatch leads to emotional frustration, reduced participation, skill gaps, and recurrence of mismatch, revealing a structural degradation cycle. This research introduces the first NIST-compliant AI modeling framework for stakeholder systems and provides a foundation for policy simulation, curriculum design, and collaborative strategy modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents an innovative and rigorous framework for stakeholder modelling in education-industry integration, combining NIST-compliant synthetic data generation with interpretable visual reasoning</p></details> |

However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.</p></details> | ISMIR 2025 |

Although diverse reward models are used for evaluating image generation, existing automated prompt engineering methods typically target specific reward configurations. Consequently, these specialized designs exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to new prompt engineering scenarios involving different reward models. To address this limitation, we introduce RATTPO (Reward-Agnostic Test-Time Prompt Optimization), a flexible test-time optimization method applicable across various reward scenarios without modification. RATTPO iteratively searches for optimized prompts by querying large language models (LLMs) \textit{without} requiring reward-specific task descriptions. Instead, it uses the optimization trajectory and a novel reward-aware feedback signal (termed a "hint") as context. Empirical results demonstrate the versatility of RATTPO, effectively enhancing user prompts across diverse reward setups that assess various generation aspects, such as aesthetics, general human preference, or spatial relationships between objects. RATTPO surpasses other test-time search baselines in search efficiency, using up to 3.5 times less inference budget, and, given sufficient inference budget, achieves performance comparable to learning-based baselines that require reward-specific fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/seminkim/RATTPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, Under review</p></details> |

Our forward pass formulates image corruption via a physically motivated PDE that couples directional advection with isotropic diffusion and Gaussian noise, controlled by dimensionless numbers (Peclet, Fourier). We implement this PDE numerically through a GPU-accelerated custom Lattice Boltzmann solver for fast evaluation. To induce realistic turbulence, we generate stochastic velocity fields that introduce coherent motion and capture multi-scale mixing. In the generative process, a neural network learns to reverse the advection-diffusion operator thus constituting a novel generative model. We discuss how previous methods emerge as specific cases of our operator, demonstrating that our framework generalizes prior PDE-based corruption techniques. We illustrate how advection improves the diversity and quality of the generated images while keeping the overall color palette unaffected. This work bridges fluid dynamics, dimensionless PDE theory, and deep generative modeling, offering a fresh perspective on physically informed image corruption processes for diffusion-based synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, pre-print, supplementary pseudocode in appendix</p></details> |

However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BATCHSAFEBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch-prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings, 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose PQCAD-DM, a novel hybrid compression framework combining Progressive Quantization (PQ) and Calibration-Assisted Distillation (CAD) to address these challenges. PQ employs a two-stage quantization with adaptive bit-width transitions guided by a momentum-based mechanism, reducing excessive weight perturbations in low-precision. CAD leverages full-precision calibration datasets during distillation, enabling the student to match full-precision performance even with a quantized teacher. As a result, PQCAD-DM achieves a balance between computational efficiency and generative quality, halving inference time while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate PQCAD-DM's superior generative capabilities and efficiency across diverse datasets, outperforming fixed-bit quantization methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Can We Detect Failures Without Failure Data? Uncertainty-Aware Runtime Failure Detection for Imitation Learning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08558v3)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed impressive robotic manipulation systems driven by advances in imitation learning and generative modeling, such as diffusion- and flow-based approaches. As robot policy performance increases, so does the complexity and time horizon of achievable tasks, inducing unexpected and diverse failure modes that are difficult to predict a priori. To enable trustworthy policy deployment in safety-critical human environments, reliable runtime failure detection becomes important during policy inference. However, most existing failure detection approaches rely on prior knowledge of failure modes and require failure data during training, which imposes a significant challenge in practicality and scalability. In response to these limitations, we present FAIL-Detect, a modular two-stage approach for failure detection in imitation learning-based robotic manipulation. To accurately identify failures from successful training data alone, we frame the problem as sequential out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We first distill policy inputs and outputs into scalar signals that correlate with policy failures and capture epistemic uncertainty. FAIL-Detect then employs conformal prediction (CP) as a versatile framework for uncertainty quantification with statistical guarantees. Empirically, we thoroughly investigate both learned and post-hoc scalar signal candidates on diverse robotic manipulation tasks. Our experiments show learned signals to be mostly consistently effective, particularly when using our novel flow-based density estimator. Furthermore, our method detects failures more accurately and faster than state-of-the-art (SOTA) failure detection baselines. These results highlight the potential of FAIL-Detect to enhance the safety and reliability of imitation learning-based robotic systems as they progress toward real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Robotics: Science and Systems 2025</p></details> |

Language is a particularly powerful source of information in social settings, especially in novel situations where language can provide both abstract information about the environment dynamics and concrete specifics about an agent that cannot be easily visually observed. In this paper, we propose Language-Informed Rational Agent Synthesis (LIRAS), a framework for drawing context-specific social inferences that integrate linguistic and visual inputs. LIRAS frames multimodal social reasoning as a process of constructing structured but situation-specific agent and environment representations - leveraging multimodal language models to parse language and visual inputs into unified symbolic representations, over which a Bayesian inverse planning engine can be run to produce granular probabilistic judgments. On a range of existing and new social reasoning tasks derived from cognitive science experiments, we find that our model (instantiated with a comparatively lightweight VLM) outperforms ablations and state-of-the-art models in capturing human judgments across all domains.</p></details> | 5 figures, 19 pages |

Although ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based TTS generation achieves natural-quality speech, it typically requires a large number of generation steps, resulting in a trade-off between quality and inference speed. To address this challenge, RapFlow-TTS enforces consistency in the velocity field along the FM-straightened ODE trajectory, enabling consistent synthetic quality with fewer generation steps. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as time interval scheduling and adversarial learning to further enhance the quality of the few-step synthesis. Experimental results show that RapFlow-TTS achieves high-fidelity speech synthesis with a 5- and 10-fold reduction in synthesis steps than the conventional FM- and score-based approaches, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods optimize a neural radiance field for each scene, relying heavily on dense training images and extensive computation resources. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce a new method called Efficient Depth-Guided Urban View Synthesis (EDUS) for fast feed-forward inference and efficient per-scene fine-tuning. Different from prior generalizable methods that infer geometry based on feature matching, EDUS leverages noisy predicted geometric priors as guidance to enable generalizable urban view synthesis from sparse input images. The geometric priors allow us to apply our generalizable model directly in the 3D space, gaining robustness across various sparsity levels. Through comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, we demonstrate promising generalization abilities on novel street scenes. Moreover, our results indicate that EDUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse view settings when combined with fast test-time optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024, Project page: https://xdimlab.github.io/EDUS/</p></details> |

Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference, our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

The RISC-V "V" Vector Extension (RVV) enhances algorithm efficiency by supporting vector registers of dynamic sizes and their grouping. Nevertheless, for very long vectors, the static number of RVV vector registers and its power-of-two grouping can lead to performance restrictions. To counteract this limitation, this work introduces Zoozve, a RISC-V vector instruction extension that eliminates the need for strip-mining. Zoozve allows for flexible vector register length and count configurations to boost data computation parallelism. With a data-adaptive register allocation approach, Zoozve permits any register groupings and accurately aligns vector lengths, cutting down register overhead and alleviating performance declines from strip-mining. Additionally, the paper details Zoozve's compiler and hardware implementations using LLVM and SystemVerilog. Initial results indicate Zoozve yields a minimum 10.10$\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count for fast Fourier transform (FFT), with a mere 5.2\% increase in overall silicon area.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, LCTES'25</p></details> |

Such systems typically deal with user histories or sequence lengths ranging in the order of O(10^3) to O(10^4) events. While adding embeddings at this scale is manageable in pre-trained models, incorporating them into real-time prediction models is challenging due to both storage and inference costs. To address this scaling challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages vector quantization (VQ) to inject a compact Semantic ID (SID) as input to the recommendation models instead of a collection of embeddings. Our method builds on recent works of SIDs by introducing three key innovations: (i) a multi-task VQ-VAE framework, called VQ fusion that fuses multiple content embeddings and categorical predictions into a single Semantic ID; (ii) a parameter-free, highly granular SID-to-embedding conversion technique, called SIDE, that is validated with two content embedding collections, thereby eliminating the need for a large parameterized lookup table; and (iii) a novel quantization method called Discrete-PCA (DPCA) which generalizes and enhances residual quantization techniques. The proposed enhancements when applied to a large-scale industrial ads-recommendation system achieves 2.4X improvement in normalized entropy (NE) gain and 3X reduction in data footprint compared to traditional SID methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 images, 6 tables</p></details> |

The most popular approach is to greedily search for the best feature at every decision point, which is fast but provably suboptimal. Recent approaches find the global optimum using branch and bound with dynamic programming, showing substantial improvements in accuracy and sparsity at great cost to scalability. An ideal solution would have the accuracy of an optimal method and the scalability of a greedy method. We introduce a family of algorithms called SPLIT (SParse Lookahead for Interpretable Trees) that moves us significantly forward in achieving this ideal balance. We demonstrate that not all sub-problems need to be solved to optimality to find high quality trees; greediness suffices near the leaves. Since each depth adds an exponential number of possible trees, this change makes our algorithms orders of magnitude faster than existing optimal methods, with negligible loss in performance. We extend this algorithm to allow scalable computation of sets of near-optimal trees (i.e., the Rashomon set).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

As Williams notes, applying this result to fast algorithms for the circuit value problem implies an $O(\sqrt{s} \cdot \mathrm{polylog}\; s)$ space algorithm for evaluating size $s$ circuits. In this work, we provide a direct reduction from circuit value to tree evaluation without passing through Turing machines, simultaneously improving the bound to $O(\sqrt{s \log s})$ space and providing a proof with fewer abstraction layers. This result can be thought of as a "sibling" result to Williams' for circuit complexity instead of time; in particular, using the fact that time-$t$ Turing machines have size $O(t \log t)$ circuits, we can recover a slightly weakened version of Williams' result, simulating time-$t$ machines in space $O(\sqrt{t} \log t)$.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</p></details> | <details><summary>R cod...</summary><p>R code is available at github.com/ericstrobl/DEBIAS</p></details> |

We present a curvature proxy that regularizes only the mixed second-order term (Weingarten term), allowing the two principal curvatures to adapt freely to data while suppressing unwanted warp. Two complementary instantiations realize this idea: (i) a finite-difference proxy that replaces each Hessian entry with four forward SDF evaluations and a single first-order gradient, and (ii) an autodiff proxy that computes the same mixed derivative via one Hessian-vector product, sidestepping explicit full Hessian assembly and remaining faster in practice. Both variants converge to the exact mixed second derivative, thus preserving the intended geometric bias without incurring full second-order graphs. On the ABC benchmarks, the proxies match or exceed the reconstruction fidelity of Hessian-based baselines while reducing GPU memory use and wall-clock time by a factor of two. Because the method is drop-in and framework-agnostic, it opens a practical path toward scalable, curvature-aware SDF learning for engineering-grade shape reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page, 10 figures, preprint</p></details> |

We demonstrate that a specialized computer vision system can be built autonomously from a natural language prompt using Agentic AI methods. This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool configuration) for a particular computer vision task. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer vision task prompt, plan a corresponding SimpleMind workflow by decomposing the task and configuring appropriate tools. From the user input prompt, "provide sm (SimpleMind) config for lungs, heart, and ribs segmentation for cxr (chest x-ray)"), the agent LLM was able to generate the plan (tool configuration file in YAML format), and execute SM-Learn (training) and SM-Think (inference) scripts autonomously. The computer vision agent automatically configured, trained, and tested itself on 50 chest x-ray images, achieving mean dice scores of 0.96, 0.82, 0.83, for lungs, heart, and ribs, respectively. This work shows the potential for autonomous planning and tool configuration that has traditionally been performed by a data scientist in the development of computer vision applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is 13 pages long and contains 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Streaming Non-Autoregressive Model for Accent Conversion and Pronunciation Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16580v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a first streaming accent conversion (AC) model that transforms non-native speech into a native-like accent while preserving speaker identity, prosody and improving pronunciation. Our approach enables stream processing by modifying a previous AC architecture with an Emformer encoder and an optimized inference mechanism. Additionally, we integrate a native text-to-speech (TTS) model to generate ideal ground-truth data for efficient training. Our streaming AC model achieves comparable performance to the top AC models while maintaining stable latency, making it the first AC system capable of streaming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

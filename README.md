| **[CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications, creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration, generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project URL: https://crea-diffusion.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Infini-gram: Scaling Unbounded n-gram Language Models to a Trillion Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17377v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2024, spotlight paper</p></details> |
| **[URECA: Unique Region Caption Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05305v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Region-level captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for specific image regions while highlighting their distinguishing features. However, existing methods struggle to produce unique captions across multi-granularity, limiting their real-world applicability. To address the need for detailed region-level understanding, we introduce URECA dataset, a large-scale dataset tailored for multi-granularity region captioning. Unlike prior datasets that focus primarily on salient objects, URECA dataset ensures a unique and consistent mapping between regions and captions by incorporating a diverse set of objects, parts, and background elements. Central to this is a stage-wise data curation pipeline, where each stage incrementally refines region selection and caption generation. By leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, our pipeline produces distinctive and contextually grounded captions with improved accuracy and semantic diversity. Building upon this dataset, we present URECA, a novel captioning model designed to effectively encode multi-granularity regions. URECA maintains essential spatial properties such as position and shape through simple yet impactful modifications to existing MLLMs, enabling fine-grained and semantically rich region descriptions. Our approach introduces dynamic mask modeling and a high-resolution mask encoder to enhance caption uniqueness. Experiments show that URECA achieves state-of-the-art performance on URECA dataset and generalizes well to existing region-level captioning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/URECA Code: https://github.com/cvlab-kaist/URECA</p></details> |
| **[Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05304v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Lakonik/GMFlow</p></details> |
| **[InteractVLM: 3D Interaction Reasoning from 2D Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05303v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InteractVLM, a novel method to estimate 3D contact points on human bodies and objects from single in-the-wild images, enabling accurate human-object joint reconstruction in 3D. This is challenging due to occlusions, depth ambiguities, and widely varying object shapes. Existing methods rely on 3D contact annotations collected via expensive motion-capture systems or tedious manual labeling, limiting scalability and generalization. To overcome this, InteractVLM harnesses the broad visual knowledge of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), fine-tuned with limited 3D contact data. However, directly applying these models is non-trivial, as they reason only in 2D, while human-object contact is inherently 3D. Thus we introduce a novel Render-Localize-Lift module that: (1) embeds 3D body and object surfaces in 2D space via multi-view rendering, (2) trains a novel multi-view localization model (MV-Loc) to infer contacts in 2D, and (3) lifts these to 3D. Additionally, we propose a new task called Semantic Human Contact estimation, where human contact predictions are conditioned explicitly on object semantics, enabling richer interaction modeling. InteractVLM outperforms existing work on contact estimation and also facilitates 3D reconstruction from an in-the wild image.

| **[One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05298v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers today still struggle to generate one-minute videos because self-attention layers are inefficient for long context. Alternatives such as Mamba layers struggle with complex multi-scene stories because their hidden states are less expressive. We experiment with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, whose hidden states themselves can be neural networks, therefore more expressive. Adding TTT layers into a pre-trained Transformer enables it to generate one-minute videos from text storyboards. For proof of concept, we curate a dataset based on Tom and Jerry cartoons. Compared to baselines such as Mamba~2, Gated DeltaNet, and sliding-window attention layers, TTT layers generate much more coherent videos that tell complex stories, leading by 34 Elo points in a human evaluation of 100 videos per method. Although promising, results still contain artifacts, likely due to the limited capability of the pre-trained 5B model. The efficiency of our implementation can also be improved. We have only experimented with one-minute videos due to resource constraints, but the approach can be extended to longer videos and more complex stories. Sample videos, code and annotations are available at: https://test-time-training.github.io/video-dit</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Hyper-parameter Optimization for Wireless Network Traffic Prediction Models with A Novel Meta-Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14535v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel meta-learning based hyper-parameter optimization framework for wireless network traffic prediction (NTP) models. The primary objective is to accumulate and leverage the acquired hyper-parameter optimization experience, enabling the rapid determination of optimal hyper-parameters for new tasks. In this paper, an attention-based deep neural network (ADNN) is employed as the base-learner to address specific NTP tasks. The meta-learner is an innovative framework that integrates meta-learning with the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), genetic algorithm (GA), and gated residual network (GRN). Specifically, KNN is utilized to identify a set of candidate hyper-parameter selection strategies for a new task, which then serves as the initial population for GA, while a GRN-based chromosome screening module accelerates the validation of offspring chromosomes, ultimately determining the optimal hyper-parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional methods such as Bayesian optimization (BO), GA, and particle swarm optimization (PSO), the proposed framework determines optimal hyper-parameters more rapidly, significantly reduces optimization time, and enhances the performance of the base-learner. It achieves an optimal balance between optimization efficiency and prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Eigenvalue-Based Randomness Test for Residual Diagnostics in Panel Data Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05297v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the Eigenvalue-Based Randomness (EBR) test - a novel approach rooted in the Tracy-Widom law from random matrix theory - and applies it to the context of residual analysis in panel data models. Unlike traditional methods, which target specific issues like cross-sectional dependence or autocorrelation, the EBR test simultaneously examines multiple assumptions by analyzing the largest eigenvalue of a symmetrized residual matrix. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the EBR test is particularly robust in detecting not only standard violations such as autocorrelation and linear cross-sectional dependence (CSD) but also more intricate non-linear and non-monotonic dependencies, making it a comprehensive and highly flexible tool for enhancing the reliability of panel data analyses.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Dion: A Communication-Efficient Optimizer for Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05295v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large AI models efficiently requires distributing computation across multiple accelerators, but this often incurs significant communication overhead -- especially during gradient synchronization. We introduce Dion, a communication-efficient optimizer that retains the synchronous semantics of standard distributed training (e.g., DDP, FSDP) while substantially reducing I/O costs. Unlike conventional optimizers that synchronize full gradient matrices, Dion leverages orthonormalized updates with device-local momentum buffers, eliminating the need for full gradient exchange. It further supports an efficient sharding strategy that avoids reconstructing large matrices during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>techn...</summary><p>technical report; comments welcome!</p></details> |
| **[Truthful or Fabricated? Using Causal Attribution to Mitigate Reward Hacking in Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05294v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-thought explanations are widely used to inspect the decision process of large language models (LLMs) and to evaluate the trustworthiness of model outputs, making them important for effective collaboration between LLMs and humans. We demonstrate that preference optimization - a key step in the alignment phase - can inadvertently reduce the faithfulness of these explanations. This occurs because the reward model (RM), which guides alignment, is tasked with optimizing both the expected quality of the response and the appropriateness of the explanations (e.g., minimizing bias or adhering to safety standards), creating potential conflicts. The RM lacks a mechanism to assess the consistency between the model's internal decision process and the generated explanation. Consequently, the LLM may engage in "reward hacking" by producing a final response that scores highly while giving an explanation tailored to maximize reward rather than accurately reflecting its reasoning. To address this issue, we propose enriching the RM's input with a causal attribution of the prediction, allowing the RM to detect discrepancies between the generated self-explanation and the model's decision process. In controlled settings, we show that this approach reduces the tendency of the LLM to generate misleading explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Using Physiological Measures, Gaze, and Facial Expressions to Model Human Trust in a Robot Partner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05291v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With robots becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains, it has become crucial to equip them with tools to achieve greater fluency in interactions with humans. One of the promising areas for further exploration lies in human trust. A real-time, objective model of human trust could be used to maximize productivity, preserve safety, and mitigate failure. In this work, we attempt to use physiological measures, gaze, and facial expressions to model human trust in a robot partner. We are the first to design an in-person, human-robot supervisory interaction study to create a dedicated trust dataset. Using this dataset, we train machine learning algorithms to identify the objective measures that are most indicative of trust in a robot partner, advancing trust prediction in human-robot interactions. Our findings indicate that a combination of sensor modalities (blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and gaze) can enhance the accuracy of detecting human trust in a robot partner. Furthermore, the Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Decision Trees classifiers exhibit consistently better performance in measuring the person's trust in the robot partner. These results lay the groundwork for constructing a real-time trust model for human-robot interaction, which could foster more efficient interactions between humans and robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Coarse-Grained Dynamics on Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09324v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a Graph Neural Network (GNN) non-Markovian modeling framework to identify coarse-grained dynamical systems on graphs. Our main idea is to systematically determine the GNN architecture by inspecting how the leading term of the Mori-Zwanzig memory term depends on the coarse-grained interaction coefficients that encode the graph topology. Based on this analysis, we found that the appropriate GNN architecture that will account for $K$-hop dynamical interactions has to employ a Message Passing (MP) mechanism with at least $2K$ steps. We also deduce that the memory length required for an accurate closure model decreases as a function of the interaction strength under the assumption that the interaction strength exhibits a power law that decays as a function of the hop distance. Supporting numerical demonstrations on two examples, a heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator model and a power system, suggest that the proposed GNN architecture can predict the coarse-grained dynamics under fixed and time-varying graph topologies.</p></details> | 43 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Dataflow Optimized Reconfigurable Acceleration for FEM-based CFD Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16245v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for analyzing and optimizing fluid flows in a wide range of real-world applications. These simulations involve approximating the solutions of the Navier-Stokes differential equations using numerical methods, which are highly compute- and memory-intensive due to their need for high-precision iterations. In this work, we introduce a high-performance FPGA accelerator specifically designed for numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations. We focus on the Finite Element Method (FEM) due to its ability to accurately model complex geometries and intricate setups typical of real-world applications. Our accelerator is implemented using High-Level Synthesis (HLS) on an AMD Alveo U200 FPGA, leveraging the reconfigurability of FPGAs to offer a flexible and adaptable solution. The proposed solution achieves 7.9x higher performance than optimized Vitis-HLS implementations and 45% lower latency with 3.64x less power compared to a software implementation on a high-end server CPU. This highlights the potential of our approach to solve Navier-Stokes equations more effectively, paving the way for tackling even more challenging CFD simulations in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the Design, Automation, and Test in Europe Conference (DATE'25)</p></details> |
| **[PHEONA: An Evaluation Framework for Large Language Model-based Approaches to Computational Phenotyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19265v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational phenotyping is essential for biomedical research but often requires significant time and resources, especially since traditional methods typically involve extensive manual data review. While machine learning and natural language processing advancements have helped, further improvements are needed. Few studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) for these tasks despite known advantages of LLMs for text-based tasks. To facilitate further research in this area, we developed an evaluation framework, Evaluation of PHEnotyping for Observational Health Data (PHEONA), that outlines context-specific considerations. We applied and demonstrated PHEONA on concept classification, a specific task within a broader phenotyping process for Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) respiratory support therapies. From the sample concepts tested, we achieved high classification accuracy, suggesting the potential for LLM-based methods to improve computational phenotyping processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 5 tables, submitted to 2025 AMIA Annual Symposium</p></details> |
| **[MA-DV2F: A Multi-Agent Navigation Framework using Dynamic Velocity Vector Field](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06404v5)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we propose MA-DV2F: Multi-Agent Dynamic Velocity Vector Field. It is a framework for simultaneously controlling a group of vehicles in challenging environments. DV2F is generated for each vehicle independently and provides a map of reference orientation and speed that a vehicle must attain at any point on the navigation grid such that it safely reaches its target. The field is dynamically updated depending on the speed and proximity of the ego-vehicle to other agents. This dynamic adaptation of the velocity vector field allows prevention of imminent collisions. Experimental results show that MA-DV2F outperforms concurrent methods in terms of safety, computational efficiency and accuracy in reaching the target when scaling to a large number of vehicles.

LiveVQA consists of 3,602 single- and multi-hop visual questions from 6 news websites across 14 news categories, featuring high-quality image-text coherence and authentic information. Our evaluation across 15 MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemma-3, and Qwen-2.5-VL family) demonstrates that stronger models perform better overall, with advanced visual reasoning capabilities proving crucial for complex multi-hop questions. Despite excellent performance on textual problems, models with tools like search engines still show significant gaps when addressing visual questions requiring latest visual knowledge, highlighting important areas for future research.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Sequential data assimilation for PDEs using shape-morphing solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16593v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shape-morphing solutions (also known as evolutional deep neural networks, reduced-order nonlinear solutions, and neural Galerkin schemes) are a new class of methods for approximating the solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Here, we introduce a sequential data assimilation method for incorporating observational data in a shape-morphing solution (SMS). Our method takes the form of a predictor-corrector scheme, where the observations are used to correct the SMS parameters using Newton-like iterations. Between observation points, the SMS equations (a set of ordinary differential equations) are used to evolve the solution forward in time. We prove that, under certain conditions, the data assimilated SMS (DA-SMS) converges uniformly towards the true state of the system. We demonstrate the efficacy of DA-SMS on three examples: the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and a two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. Our numerical results suggest that DA-SMS converges with relatively sparse observations and a single iteration of the Newton-like method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Computational Physics</p></details> |
| **[Is Adversarial Training with Compressed Datasets Effective?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05675v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset Condensation (DC) refers to the recent class of dataset compression methods that generate a smaller, synthetic, dataset from a larger dataset. This synthetic dataset aims to retain the essential information of the original dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance levels comparable to those trained on the full dataset. Most current DC methods have mainly concerned with achieving high test performance with limited data budget, and have not directly addressed the question of adversarial robustness. In this work, we investigate the impact of adversarial robustness on models trained with compressed datasets. We show that the compressed datasets obtained from DC methods are not effective in transferring adversarial robustness to models. As a solution to improve dataset compression efficiency and adversarial robustness simultaneously, we present a robustness-aware dataset compression method based on finding the Minimal Finite Covering (MFC) of the dataset. The proposed method is (1) provably robust by minimizing the generalized adversarial loss, (2) more effective than DC methods when applying adversarial training over MFC, (3) obtained by a one-time computation and is applicable for any model.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis 2025 (SCIA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[The challenge of uncertainty quantification of large language models in medicine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05278v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning. Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent provisionality of medical knowledge.</p></details> | 25 pages, 11 figures |

Traditional feature selection methods for classification use data from all classes to select features for each class. This paper explores feature selection methods that select features for each class separately, using class models based on low-rank generative methods and introducing a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature selection criterion. This novel approach has theoretical true feature recovery guarantees under certain assumptions and is shown to outperform some existing feature selection methods on standard classification datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the CVPR conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[AnomalousNet: A Hybrid Approach with Attention U-Nets and Change Point Detection for Accurate Characterization of Anomalous Diffusion in Video Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05271v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomalous diffusion occurs in a wide range of systems, including protein transport within cells, animal movement in complex habitats, pollutant dispersion in groundwater, and nanoparticle motion in synthetic materials. Accurately estimating the anomalous diffusion exponent and the diffusion coefficient from the particle trajectories is essential to distinguish between sub-diffusive, super-diffusive, or normal diffusion regimes. These estimates provide a deeper insight into the underlying dynamics of the system, facilitating the identification of particle behaviors and the detection of changes in diffusion states. However, analyzing short and noisy video data, which often yield incomplete and heterogeneous trajectories, poses a significant challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We introduce a data-driven method that integrates particle tracking, an attention U-Net architecture, and a change-point detection algorithm to address these issues. This approach not only infers the anomalous diffusion parameters with high accuracy but also identifies temporal transitions between different states, even in the presence of noise and limited temporal resolution. Our methodology demonstrated strong performance in the 2nd Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge benchmark within the top submissions for video tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[From Sparse Signal to Smooth Motion: Real-Time Motion Generation with Rolling Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05265v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In extended reality (XR), generating full-body motion of the users is important to understand their actions, drive their virtual avatars for social interaction, and convey a realistic sense of presence. While prior works focused on spatially sparse and always-on input signals from motion controllers, many XR applications opt for vision-based hand tracking for reduced user friction and better immersion. Compared to controllers, hand tracking signals are less accurate and can even be missing for an extended period of time. To handle such unreliable inputs, we present Rolling Prediction Model (RPM), an online and real-time approach that generates smooth full-body motion from temporally and spatially sparse input signals. Our model generates 1) accurate motion that matches the inputs (i.e., tracking mode) and 2) plausible motion when inputs are missing (i.e., synthesis mode). More importantly, RPM generates seamless transitions from tracking to synthesis, and vice versa. To demonstrate the practical importance of handling noisy and missing inputs, we present GORP, the first dataset of realistic sparse inputs from a commercial virtual reality (VR) headset with paired high quality body motion ground truth. GORP provides >14 hours of VR gameplay data from 28 people using motion controllers (spatially sparse) and hand tracking (spatially and temporally sparse). We benchmark RPM against the state of the art on both synthetic data and GORP to highlight how we can bridge the gap for real-world applications with a realistic dataset and by handling unreliable input signals. Our code, pretrained models, and GORP dataset are available in the project webpage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in CVPR'25.

For instance, DUSt3R recently introduced the concept of viewpoint-invariant point maps, generalizing depth prediction and showing that all key problems in the 3D reconstruction of static scenes can be reduced to predicting such point maps. In this paper, we develop an analogous concept for a very different problem: the reconstruction of the 3D shape and pose of deformable objects. To this end, we introduce Dual Point Maps (DualPM), where a pair of point maps is extracted from the same image-one associating pixels to their 3D locations on the object and the other to a canonical version of the object in its rest pose. We also extend point maps to amodal reconstruction to recover the complete shape of the object, even through self-occlusions. We show that 3D reconstruction and 3D pose estimation can be reduced to the prediction of DualPMs. Empirically, we demonstrate that this representation is a suitable target for deep networks to predict. Specifically, we focus on modeling quadrupeds, showing that DualPMs can be trained purely on synthetic 3D data, consisting of one or two models per category, while generalizing effectively to real images. With this approach, we achieve significant improvements over previous methods for the 3D analysis and reconstruction of such objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

| **[A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18240v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and/or 3D rotations of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional antennas. It is thus expected that the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential, 6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation, and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications. We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, submitted to IEEE for publication</p></details> |

The main issue pertains to the object-oriented modelling paradigm, which requires georeferencing, watertight geometry, facade semantics, and low-poly representation -- Contrasting unstructured mesh-oriented models. In Texture2LoD3, we introduce a novel method leveraging the ubiquity of 3D building model priors and panoramic street-level images, enabling the reconstruction of LoD3 building models. We observe that prior low-detail building models can serve as valid planar targets for ortho-rectifying street-level panoramic images. Moreover, deploying segmentation on accurately textured low-level building surfaces supports maintaining essential georeferencing, watertight geometry, and low-poly representation for LoD3 reconstruction. In the absence of LoD3 validation data, we additionally introduce the ReLoD3 dataset, on which we experimentally demonstrate that our method leads to improved facade segmentation accuracy by 11% and can replace costly manual projections. We believe that Texture2LoD3 can scale the adoption of LoD3 models, opening applications in estimating building solar potential or enhancing autonomous driving simulations.

Existing adaptive RAG (ARAG) systems excel at in-depth exploration within a single source but struggle to effectively and controllably explore different retrieval sources, as they fail to foresee their internal knowledge features. We develop a novel multi-source ARAG system, PrefRAG, which enhances RAG by enabling in-depth and controllable exploration of diverse retrieval sources through preference-driven adaptive retrieval and self-reflection. PrefRAG first fully explores controllable local sources in adaptive retrieval and supplements with the web when appropriate, ultimately selecting the optimal source for knowledge observation. Subsequently, PrefRAG feeds answer quality feedback into the retrieval process, optimizing it from the generation perspective to produce higher-quality responses. Extensive experiments confirm its superiority, high retrieval efficiency, and knowledge controllability. PrefRAG outperforms Vanilla RAG and the leading MS-ARAG by up to 25.6% and 13.9% respectively. Additionally, PrefRAG trained with DPO achieves higher performance. The code and data are available at https://github.com/QingFei1/PrefRAG.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 5 figures, 28 tables</p></details> |

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving such problems, especially with sparse measurements and incomplete system information. However, PINNs face convergence issues, stability problems, overfitting, and complex loss function design. Here we introduce PINNverse, a training paradigm that addresses these limitations by reformulating the learning process as a constrained differential optimization problem. This approach achieves a dynamic balance between data loss and differential equation residual loss during training while preventing overfitting. PINNverse combines the advantages of PINNs with the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers to enable convergence on any point on the Pareto front. We demonstrate robust and accurate parameter estimation from noisy data in four classical ODE and PDE models from physics and biology. Our method enables accurate parameter inference also when the forward problem is expensive to solve.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

However, devices with limited capacity can create bottlenecks and slow down model convergence. One effective approach to addressing this issue is to use an efficient feature selection method, which reduces overall resource demands by minimizing communication and computation costs, thereby mitigating the impact of struggling nodes. Existing federated feature selection (FFS) methods are either considered as a separate step from FL or rely on a third party. These approaches increase computation and communication overhead, making them impractical for real-world high-dimensional datasets. To address this, we present \textit{Dynamic Sparse Federated Feature Selection} (DSFFS), the first innovative embedded FFS that is efficient in both communication and computation. In the proposed method, feature selection occurs simultaneously with model training. During training, input-layer neurons, their connections, and hidden-layer connections are dynamically pruned and regrown, eliminating uninformative features. This process enhances computational efficiency on devices, improves network communication efficiency, and boosts global model performance. Several experiments are conducted on nine real-world datasets of varying dimensionality from diverse domains, including biology, image, speech, and text. The results under a realistic non-iid data distribution setting show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between accuracy, computation, and communication costs by selecting more informative features compared to other state-of-the-art FFS methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, existing adaptive RAG methods rely on LLMs to predict retrieval timing and directly use retrieved information for generation, often failing to reflect real information needs and fully leverage retrieved knowledge. We develop DeepNote, an adaptive RAG framework that achieves in-depth and robust exploration of knowledge sources through note-centric adaptive retrieval. DeepNote employs notes as carriers for refining and accumulating knowledge. During in-depth exploration, it uses these notes to determine retrieval timing, formulate retrieval queries, and iteratively assess knowledge growth, ultimately leveraging the best note for answer generation. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DeepNote significantly outperforms all baselines (+10.2% to +20.1%) and exhibits the ability to gather knowledge with both high density and quality. Additionally, DPO further improves the performance of DeepNote.

Using a dataset of 36595 geo-located tweets from 774 users in the New York area, we found that a higher proportion of actional tweets predicted increased exposure to physical even if overall users ultimately moved toward lower-risk zones. This counterintuitive finding suggests that proactivity, manifested in sharing crisis relevant content, correlates with greater exposure to risk, possibly due to increased mobility or engagement in hazardous areas. In contrast, a greater number of social media peers was associated with reduced risk exposure. This study builds on appraisal theory, which frames risk-related decisions as outcomes of cognitively mediated emotional and rational evaluations. We extend this theory to digital crisis behavior, distinguishing between emotional and actional appraisals expressed via social media. Tweets were categorized using sentiment analysis and semantic classification, enabling the isolation of affective and behavioral signals. Our methodology combines natural language processing with spatial vector analysis to estimate individual movement paths and risk exposure based on evacuation and flooding maps. The resulting RBQ captures both direction and intensity of risk behavior, allowing us to model how online communication reflects and predicts real-world risk engagement during natural disasters.</p></details> | 26 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Reality Check of Vision-Language Pre-training in Radiology: Have We Progressed Using Text?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05227v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training has recently gained popularity as it allows learning rich feature representations using large-scale data sources. This paradigm has quickly made its way into the medical image analysis community. In particular, there is an impressive amount of recent literature developing vision-language models for radiology. However, the available medical datasets with image-text supervision are scarce, and medical concepts are fine-grained, involving expert knowledge that existing vision-language models struggle to encode. In this paper, we propose to take a prudent step back from the literature and revisit supervised, unimodal pre-training, using fine-grained labels instead. We conduct an extensive comparison demonstrating that unimodal pre-training is highly competitive and better suited to integrating heterogeneous data sources. Our results also question the potential of recent vision-language models for open-vocabulary generalization, which have been evaluated using optimistic experimental settings. Finally, we study novel alternatives to better integrate fine-grained labels and noisy text supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>IPMI ...</summary><p>IPMI 2025.

However, previous methods still struggled to effectively handle forged images processed with diverse forgery operations in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel Reinforced Multi-teacher Knowledge Distillation (Re-MTKD) framework for the IFDL task, structured around an encoder-decoder \textbf{C}onvNeXt-\textbf{U}perNet along with \textbf{E}dge-Aware Module, named Cue-Net. First, three Cue-Net models are separately trained for the three main types of image forgeries, i.e., copy-move, splicing, and inpainting, which then serve as the multi-teacher models to train the target student model with Cue-Net through self-knowledge distillation. A Reinforced Dynamic Teacher Selection (Re-DTS) strategy is developed to dynamically assign weights to the involved teacher models, which facilitates specific knowledge transfer and enables the student model to effectively learn both the common and specific natures of diverse tampering traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves superior performance on several recently emerged datasets comprised of various kinds of image forgeries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Reducing the Communication of Distributed Model Predictive Control: Autoencoders and Formation Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05223v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication remains a key factor limiting the applicability of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) in realistic settings, despite advances in wireless communication. DMPC schemes can require an overwhelming amount of information exchange between agents as the amount of data depends on the length of the predication horizon, for which some applications require a significant length to formally guarantee nominal asymptotic stability. This work aims to provide an approach to reduce the communication effort of DMPC by reducing the size of the communicated data between agents. Using an autoencoder, the communicated data is reduced by the encoder part of the autoencoder prior to communication and reconstructed by the decoder part upon reception within the distributed optimization algorithm that constitutes the DMPC scheme. The choice of a learning-based reduction method is motivated by structure inherent to the data, which results from the data's connection to solutions of optimal control problems. The approach is implemented and tested at the example of formation control of differential-drive robots, which is challenging for optimization-based control due to the robots' nonholonomic constraints, and which is interesting due to the practical importance of mobile robotics. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented first in form of a simulative analysis showing that the resulting control performance yields a satisfactory accuracy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms the canonical naive way to reduce communication by reducing the length of the prediction horizon. Moreover, it is shown that numerical experiments conducted on embedded computation hardware, with real distributed computation and wireless communication, work well with the proposed way of reducing communication even in practical scenarios in which full communication fails.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Leveraging LLMs for Utility-Focused Annotation: Reducing Manual Effort for Retrieval and RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05220v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval models typically rely on costly human-labeled query-document relevance annotations for training and evaluation. To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning model to detect basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and artifacts on Mohs slides. A total of 731 Mohs slides from 51 patients with BCCs were used in this study, with 91 containing tumor and 640 without tumor which was defined as non-tumor. The dataset was employed to train U-Net based models that segment tumor and non-tumor regions on the slides. The segmented patches were classified as tumor, or non-tumor to produce predictions for whole slide images (WSIs). For the segmentation phase, the deep learning model success was measured using a Dice score with 0.70 and 0.67 value, area under the curve (AUC) score with 0.98 and 0.96 for tumor and non-tumor, respectively. For the tumor classification, an AUC of 0.98 for patch-based detection, and AUC of 0.91 for slide-based detection was obtained on the test dataset. We present an AI system that can detect tumors and non-tumors in Mohs slides with high success. Deep learning can aid Mohs surgeons and dermatopathologists in making more accurate decisions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha < 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Data assimilation (DA) improves these models by aligning them with real-world observations, but marine biogeochemistry DA faces challenges due to model complexity, strong nonlinearity, and sparse, uncertain observations. Existing DA methods applied to marine biogeochemistry struggle to update unobserved variables effectively, while ensemble-based methods are computationally too expensive for high-complexity marine biogeochemistry models. This study demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can improve marine biogeochemistry DA by learning statistical relationships between observed and unobserved variables. We integrate ML-driven balancing schemes into a 1D prototype of a system used to forecast marine biogeochemistry in the North-West European Shelf seas. ML is applied to predict (i) state-dependent correlations from free-run ensembles and (ii), in an ``end-to-end'' fashion, analysis increments from an Ensemble Kalman Filter. Our results show that ML significantly enhances updates for previously not-updated variables when compared to univariate schemes akin to those used operationally. Furthermore, ML models exhibit moderate transferability to new locations, a crucial step toward scaling these methods to 3D operational systems. We conclude that ML offers a clear pathway to overcome current computational bottlenecks in marine biogeochemistry DA and that refining transferability, optimizing training data sampling, and evaluating scalability for large-scale marine forecasting, should be future research priorities.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 13 figures (10 in main text, 3 in appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Power of LLMs in Dense Retrieval with Query Likelihood Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05216v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense retrieval is a crucial task in Information Retrieval (IR) and is the foundation for downstream tasks such as re-ranking. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

This is due to the internal access insiders have to systems, information, and infrastructure. %One example of this influence is where anonymous respondents submit web-based job search site reviews, an insider threat risk to organizations. Signals for such risks may be found in anonymous submissions to public web-based job search site reviews. This research studies the potential for large language models (LLMs) to analyze and detect insider threat sentiment within job site reviews. Addressing ethical data collection concerns, this research utilizes synthetic data generation using LLMs alongside existing job review datasets. A comparative analysis of sentiment scores generated by LLMs is benchmarked against expert human scoring. Findings reveal that LLMs demonstrate alignment with human evaluations in most cases, thus effectively identifying nuanced indicators of threat sentiment. The performance is lower on human-generated data than synthetic data, suggesting areas for improvement in evaluating real-world data. Text diversity analysis found differences between human-generated and LLM-generated datasets, with synthetic data exhibiting somewhat lower diversity. Overall, the results demonstrate the applicability of LLMs to insider threat detection, and a scalable solution for insider sentiment testing by overcoming ethical and logistical barriers tied to data acquisition.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 0 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Post-Training Language Models for Continual Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05214v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data, such as news articles, social media posts, and chatbot conversations, is inherently dynamic and non-stationary, presenting significant challenges for constructing real-time structured representations through knowledge graphs (KGs). Relation Extraction (RE), a fundamental component of KG creation, often struggles to adapt to evolving data when traditional models rely on static, outdated datasets. Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) methods tackle this issue by incrementally learning new relations while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This study investigates the application of pre-trained language models (PLMs), specifically large language models (LLMs), to CRE, with a focus on leveraging memory replay to address catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate decoder-only models (eg, Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B) and encoder-decoder models (eg, Flan-T5 Base) on the TACRED and FewRel datasets. Task-incremental fine-tuning of LLMs demonstrates superior performance over earlier approaches using encoder-only models like BERT on TACRED, excelling in seen-task accuracy and overall performance (measured by whole and average accuracy), particularly with the Mistral and Flan-T5 models. Results on FewRel are similarly promising, achieving second place in whole and average accuracy metrics. This work underscores critical factors in knowledge transfer, language model architecture, and KG completeness, advancing CRE with LLMs and memory replay for dynamic, real-time relation extraction.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[On Sinkhorn's Algorithm and Choice Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00260v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a broad class of models widely used in practice for choice and ranking data based on Luce's choice axiom, including the Bradley--Terry--Luce and Plackett--Luce models, we show that the associated maximum likelihood estimation problems are equivalent to a classic matrix balancing problem with target row and column sums. This perspective opens doors between two seemingly unrelated research areas, and allows us to unify existing algorithms in the choice modeling literature as special instances or analogs of Sinkhorn's celebrated algorithm for matrix balancing. We draw inspirations from these connections and resolve some open problems on the study of Sinkhorn's algorithm. We establish the global linear convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm for non-negative matrices whenever finite scaling matrices exist, and characterize its linear convergence rate in terms of the algebraic connectivity of a weighted bipartite graph. We further derive the sharp asymptotic rate of linear convergence, which generalizes a classic result of Knight (2008). To our knowledge, these are the first quantitative linear convergence results for Sinkhorn's algorithm for general non-negative matrices and positive marginals. Our results highlight the importance of connectivity and orthogonality structures in matrix balancing and Sinkhorn's algorithm, which could be of independent interest. More broadly, the connections we establish in this paper between matrix balancing and choice modeling could also help motivate further transmission of ideas and lead to interesting results in both disciplines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Operations Research</p></details> |
| **[Exploiting individual differences to bootstrap communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05211v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Establishing a communication system is hard because the intended meaning of a signal is unknown to its receiver when first produced, and the signaller also has no idea how that signal will be interpreted. Most theoretical accounts of the emergence of communication systems rely on feedback to reinforce behaviours that have led to successful communication in the past. However, providing such feedback requires already being able to communicate the meaning that was intended or interpreted. Therefore these accounts cannot explain how communication can be bootstrapped from non-communicative behaviours. Here we present a model that shows how a communication system, capable of expressing an unbounded number of meanings, can emerge as a result of individual behavioural differences in a large population without any pre-existing means to determine communicative success. The two key cognitive capabilities responsible for this outcome are behaving predictably in a given situation, and an alignment of psychological states ahead of signal production that derives from shared intentionality. Since both capabilities can exist independently of communication, our results are compatible with theories in which large flexible socially-learned communication systems like language are the product of a general but well-developed capacity for social cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages including supplementary information, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Correcting Class Imbalances with Self-Training for Improved Universal Lesion Detection and Tagging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05207v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal lesion detection and tagging (ULDT) in CT studies is critical for tumor burden assessment and tracking the progression of lesion status (growth/shrinkage) over time. However, a lack of fully annotated data hinders the development of effective ULDT approaches. Prior work used the DeepLesion dataset (4,427 patients, 10,594 studies, 32,120 CT slices, 32,735 lesions, 8 body part labels) for algorithmic development, but this dataset is not completely annotated and contains class imbalances. To address these issues, in this work, we developed a self-training pipeline for ULDT. A VFNet model was trained on a limited 11.5\% subset of DeepLesion (bounding boxes + tags) to detect and classify lesions in CT studies. Then, it identified and incorporated novel lesion candidates from a larger unseen data subset into its training set, and self-trained itself over multiple rounds. Multiple self-training experiments were conducted with different threshold policies to select predicted lesions with higher quality and cover the class imbalances. We discovered that direct self-training improved the sensitivities of over-represented lesion classes at the expense of under-represented classes. However, upsampling the lesions mined during self-training along with a variable threshold policy yielded a 6.5\% increase in sensitivity at 4 FP in contrast to self-training without class balancing (72\% vs 78.5\%) and a 11.7\% increase compared to the same self-training policy without upsampling (66.8\% vs 78.5\%). Furthermore, we show that our results either improved or maintained the sensitivity at 4FP for all 8 lesion classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at SPIE Medical Imaging 2023</p></details> |

| **[CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications, creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration, generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project URL: https://crea-diffusion.github.io</p></details> |

Our answer is yes, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- 5 trillion tokens. This is the largest $n$-gram LM ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine--$\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2024, spotlight paper</p></details> |
| **[One-Minute Video Generation with Test-Time Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05298v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers today still struggle to generate one-minute videos because self-attention layers are inefficient for long context. Alternatives such as Mamba layers struggle with complex multi-scene stories because their hidden states are less expressive. We experiment with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, whose hidden states themselves can be neural networks, therefore more expressive. Adding TTT layers into a pre-trained Transformer enables it to generate one-minute videos from text storyboards. For proof of concept, we curate a dataset based on Tom and Jerry cartoons. Compared to baselines such as Mamba~2, Gated DeltaNet, and sliding-window attention layers, TTT layers generate much more coherent videos that tell complex stories, leading by 34 Elo points in a human evaluation of 100 videos per method. Although promising, results still contain artifacts, likely due to the limited capability of the pre-trained 5B model. The efficiency of our implementation can also be improved. We have only experimented with one-minute videos due to resource constraints, but the approach can be extended to longer videos and more complex stories. Sample videos, code and annotations are available at: https://test-time-training.github.io/video-dit</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Is Adversarial Training with Compressed Datasets Effective?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05675v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset Condensation (DC) refers to the recent class of dataset compression methods that generate a smaller, synthetic, dataset from a larger dataset. This synthetic dataset aims to retain the essential information of the original dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance levels comparable to those trained on the full dataset. Most current DC methods have mainly concerned with achieving high test performance with limited data budget, and have not directly addressed the question of adversarial robustness. In this work, we investigate the impact of adversarial robustness on models trained with compressed datasets. We show that the compressed datasets obtained from DC methods are not effective in transferring adversarial robustness to models. As a solution to improve dataset compression efficiency and adversarial robustness simultaneously, we present a robustness-aware dataset compression method based on finding the Minimal Finite Covering (MFC) of the dataset. The proposed method is (1) provably robust by minimizing the generalized adversarial loss, (2) more effective than DC methods when applying adversarial training over MFC, (3) obtained by a one-time computation and is applicable for any model.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis 2025 (SCIA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Infinitely Divisible Noise for Differential Privacy: Nearly Optimal Error in the High $\varepsilon$ Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05202v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) can be achieved in a distributed manner, where multiple parties add independent noise such that their sum protects the overall dataset with DP. A common technique here is for each party to sample their noise from the decomposition of an infinitely divisible distribution. We analyze two mechanisms in this setting: 1) the generalized discrete Laplace (GDL) mechanism, whose distribution (which is closed under summation) follows from differences of i.i.d. negative binomial shares, and 2) the multi-scale discrete Laplace (MSDLap) mechanism, a novel mechanism following the sum of multiple i.i.d. discrete Laplace shares at different scales. For $\varepsilon \geq 1$, our mechanisms can be parameterized to have $O\left(\Delta^3 e^{-\varepsilon}\right)$ and $O\left(\min\left(\Delta^3 e^{-\varepsilon}, \Delta^2 e^{-2\varepsilon/3}\right)\right)$ MSE, respectively, where $\Delta$ denote the sensitivity; the latter bound matches known optimality results. We also show a transformation from the discrete setting to the continuous setting, which allows us to transform both mechanisms to the continuous setting and thereby achieve the optimal $O\left(\Delta^2 e^{-2\varepsilon / 3}\right)$ MSE. To our knowledge, these are the first infinitely divisible additive noise mechanisms that achieve order-optimal MSE under pure DP, so our work shows formally there is no separation in utility when query-independent noise adding mechanisms are restricted to infinitely divisible noise. For the continuous setting, our result improves upon the Arete mechanism from [Pagh and Stausholm, ALT 2022] which gives an MSE of $O\left(\Delta^2 e^{-\varepsilon/4}\right)$. Furthermore, we give an exact sampler tuned to efficiently implement the MSDLap mechanism, and we apply our results to improve a state of the art multi-message shuffle DP protocol in the high $\varepsilon$ regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in FORC 2025</p></details> |

This work introduces a novel joint multimodal scene graph framework that explicitly models the relationships among chart components and their underlying structures. The framework integrates both visual and textual graphs to capture structural and semantic characteristics, while a graph contrastive learning strategy aligns node representations across modalities enabling their seamless incorporation into a transformer decoder as soft prompts. Moreover, a set of tailored Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts is proposed to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in zero-s ot scenarios by mitigating hallucinations. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks including ChartQA, OpenCQA, and ChartX demonstrate significant performance improvements and validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning symmetries in datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05174v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate how symmetries present in datasets affect the structure of the latent space learned by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By training VAEs on data originating from simple mechanical systems and particle collisions, we analyze the organization of the latent space through a relevance measure that identifies the most meaningful latent directions. We show that when symmetries or approximate symmetries are present, the VAE self-organizes its latent space, effectively compressing the data along a reduced number of latent variables. This behavior captures the intrinsic dimensionality determined by the symmetry constraints and reveals hidden relations among the features. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of a simple toy model, demonstrating how, under idealized conditions, the latent space aligns with the symmetry directions of the data manifold. We illustrate these findings with examples ranging from two-dimensional datasets with $O(2)$ symmetry to realistic datasets from electron-positron and proton-proton collisions. Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised generative models to expose underlying structures in data and offer a novel approach to symmetry discovery without explicit supervision.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[EffOWT: Transfer Visual Language Models to Open-World Tracking Efficiently and Effectively](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05141v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-World Tracking (OWT) aims to track every object of any category, which requires the model to have strong generalization capabilities. Trackers can improve their generalization ability by leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, challenges arise with the fine-tuning strategies when VLMs are transferred to OWT: full fine-tuning results in excessive parameter and memory costs, while the zero-shot strategy leads to sub-optimal performance. To solve the problem, EffOWT is proposed for efficiently transferring VLMs to OWT. Specifically, we build a small and independent learnable side network outside the VLM backbone. By freezing the backbone and only executing backpropagation on the side network, the model's efficiency requirements can be met. In addition, EffOWT enhances the side network by proposing a hybrid structure of Transformer and CNN to improve the model's performance in the OWT field. Finally, we implement sparse interactions on the MLP, thus reducing parameter updates and memory costs significantly. Thanks to the proposed methods, EffOWT achieves an absolute gain of 5.5% on the tracking metric OWTA for unknown categories, while only updating 1.3% of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning, with a 36.4% memory saving. Other metrics also demonstrate obvious improvement.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DEPT: Decoupled Embeddings for Pre-training Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05021v5)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Model pre-training uses broad data mixtures to enhance performance across domains and languages. However, training on such heterogeneous text corpora requires extensive and expensive efforts. Since these data sources vary significantly in lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects, they cause negative interference or the ``curse of multilinguality''. To address these challenges we propose a communication-efficient pre-training framework, DEPT. Our method decouples embeddings from the transformer body while simultaneously training the latter on multiple data sources without requiring a shared vocabulary. DEPT can: (1) train robustly and effectively under significant data heterogeneity, (2) minimize token embedding parameters to only what the data source vocabulary requires, while cutting communication costs in direct proportion to both the communication frequency and the reduction in parameters, (3) enhance transformer body plasticity and generalization, improving both average perplexity (up to 20%) and downstream task performance, and (4) enable training with custom optimized vocabularies per data source. We demonstrate DEPT's potential via the first vocabulary-agnostic federated pre-training of billion-scale models, reducing communication costs by orders of magnitude and embedding memory by 4-5x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, existing methods have high computational demands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded regions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable transformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D reconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from only six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving scenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views.

| **[DeltaProduct: Improving State-Tracking in Linear RNNs via Householder Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10297v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKV-7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Federated Analytics: Taxonomy, Enabling Techniques, Applications and Open Issues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12666v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating influx of data generated by networked edge devices, coupled with the growing awareness of data privacy, has restricted the traditional data analytics workflow, where the edge data are gathered by a centralized server to be further utilized by data analysts. To continue leveraging vast edge data to support various data-incentive applications, computing paradigms have promoted a transformative shift from centralized data processing to privacy-preserved distributed data processing. The need to perform data analytics on private edge data motivates federated analytics (FA), an emerging technique to support collaborative data analytics among diverse data owners without centralizing the raw data. Despite the wide applications of FA in industry and academia, a comprehensive examination of existing research efforts in FA has been notably absent. This survey aims to bridge this gap by first providing an overview of FA, elucidating key concepts, and discussing its relationship with similar concepts. We then thoroughly examine FA, including its key challenges, taxonomy, and enabling techniques. Diverse FA applications, including statistical metrics, frequency-related applications, database query operations, FL-assisting FA tasks, and other wireless network applications are then carefully reviewed. We complete the survey with several open research issues, future directions, and a comprehensive lessons learned part. This survey intends to provide a holistic understanding of the emerging FA techniques and foster the continued evolution of privacy-preserving distributed data processing in the emerging networked society.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This survey is to be published in by IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials</p></details> |

First, in the case of a convex constraint set $K$, we express the hardness of the prediction problem (the minimax regret) in terms of the intrinsic volumes of $K$; specifically, it equals the logarithm of the Wills functional from convex geometry. We then establish a comparison inequality for the Wills functional in the general nonconvex case, which underlines the metric nature of this quantity and generalizes the Slepian-Sudakov-Fernique comparison principle for the Gaussian width. Motivated by this inequality, we characterize the exact order of magnitude of the considered functional for a general nonconvex set, in terms of global covering numbers and local Gaussian widths. This implies sharp estimates, of metric nature, on the log-Laplace transform of the intrinsic volume sequence of a convex body. As part of our analysis, we also characterize the minimax redundancy for a general constraint set. We finally relate and contrast our findings with classical asymptotic results in information theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revision; 56 pages</p></details> |

The architecture leverages the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials as basis functions, significantly enhancing both convergence speed and solution accuracy compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem provides a strong theoretical foundation for the interpretability and optimization of the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical examples, involving both smooth and singular solutions in various dimensions. This work not only addresses the challenges of solving high-dimensional and singular Monge-Amp\`ere equations but also highlights the potential of neural network-based approaches for complex partial differential equations. Additionally, the method is applied to the optimal transport problem in image mapping, showcasing its practical utility in geometric image transformation. This approach is expected to pave the way for further enhancement of KAN-based applications and numerical solutions of PDEs across a wide range of scientific and engineering fields.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[No Re-Train, More Gain: Upgrading Backbones with Diffusion model for Pixel-Wise and Weakly-Supervised Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16182v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes using only a few annotated images. Despite considerable progress under pixel-wise support annotation, current FSS methods still face three issues: the inflexibility of backbone upgrade without re-training, the inability to uniformly handle various types of annotations (e.g., scribble, bounding box, mask, and text), and the difficulty in accommodating different annotation quantity. To address these issues simultaneously, we propose DiffUp, a novel framework that conceptualizes the FSS task as a conditional generative problem using a diffusion process. For the first issue, we introduce a backbone-agnostic feature transformation module that converts different segmentation cues into unified coarse priors, facilitating seamless backbone upgrade without re-training. For the second issue, due to the varying granularity of transformed priors from diverse annotation types (scribble, bounding box, mask, and text), we conceptualize these multi-granular transformed priors as analogous to noisy intermediates at different steps of a diffusion model. This is implemented via a self-conditioned modulation block coupled with a dual-level quality modulation branch. For the third issue, we incorporate an uncertainty-aware information fusion module to harmonize the variability across zero-shot, one-shot, and many-shot scenarios. Evaluated through rigorous benchmarks, DiffUp significantly outperforms existing FSS models in terms of flexibility and accuracy.</p></details> | 9 figures |

Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 WDFM-AD |
| **[Transforming Future Data Center Operations and Management via Physical AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04982v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data centers (DCs) as mission-critical infrastructures are pivotal in powering the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and the digital economy. The evolution from Internet DC to AI DC has introduced new challenges in operating and managing data centers for improved business resilience and reduced total cost of ownership. As a result, new paradigms, beyond the traditional approaches based on best practices, must be in order for future data centers. In this research, we propose and develop a novel Physical AI (PhyAI) framework for advancing DC operations and management. Our system leverages the emerging capabilities of state-of-the-art industrial products and our in-house research and development. Specifically, it presents three core modules, namely: 1) an industry-grade in-house simulation engine to simulate DC operations in a highly accurate manner, 2) an AI engine built upon NVIDIA PhysicsNemo for the training and evaluation of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) models, and 3) a digital twin platform built upon NVIDIA Omniverse for our proposed 5-tier digital twin framework. This system presents a scalable and adaptable solution to digitalize, optimize, and automate future data center operations and management, by enabling real-time digital twins for future data centers. To illustrate its effectiveness, we present a compelling case study on building a surrogate model for predicting the thermal and airflow profiles of a large-scale DC in a real-time manner. Our results demonstrate its superior performance over traditional time-consuming Computational Fluid Dynamics/Heat Transfer (CFD/HT) simulation, with a median absolute temperature prediction error of 0.18 {\deg}C. This emerging approach would open doors to several potential research directions for advancing Physical AI in future DC operations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Differential Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have streamlined the BI workflow by automatically performing task planning, reasoning, and actions in executable environments based on natural language (NL) queries. However, existing approaches primarily focus on individual BI tasks such as NL2SQL and NL2VIS. The fragmentation of tasks across different data roles and tools lead to inefficiencies and potential errors due to the iterative and collaborative nature of BI. In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that integrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational notebook interface. DataLab supports various BI tasks for different data roles in data preparation, analysis, and visualization by seamlessly combining LLM assistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this unification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for enterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to facilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context management strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art performance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover, DataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from Tencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction in token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICDE 2025</p></details> |

| **[REWIND: Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion with Exemplar-Based Identity Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04956v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present REWIND (Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion), a one-step diffusion model for real-time, high-fidelity human motion estimation from egocentric image inputs. While an existing method for egocentric whole-body (i.e., body and hands) motion estimation is non-real-time and acausal due to diffusion-based iterative motion refinement to capture correlations between body and hand poses, REWIND operates in a fully causal and real-time manner. To enable real-time inference, we introduce (1) cascaded body-hand denoising diffusion, which effectively models the correlation between egocentric body and hand motions in a fast, feed-forward manner, and (2) diffusion distillation, which enables high-quality motion estimation with a single denoising step. Our denoising diffusion model is based on a modified Transformer architecture, designed to causally model output motions while enhancing generalizability to unseen motion lengths. Additionally, REWIND optionally supports identity-conditioned motion estimation when identity prior is available. To this end, we propose a novel identity conditioning method based on a small set of pose exemplars of the target identity, which further enhances motion estimation quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that REWIND significantly outperforms the existing baselines both with and without exemplar-based identity conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, project page: https://jyunlee.github.io/projects/rewind/</p></details> |

This paper investigates how effectively smaller language models (Llama 2 7B and Llama 3 8B) can be fine-tuned with a limited dataset of 1,514 Multi-state Bar Examination (MBE) questions to improve legal question answering accuracy. We evaluate these models on the 2022 MBE questions licensed from JD Advising, the same dataset used in the 'GPT-4 passes the Bar exam' study. Our methodology involves collecting approximately 200 questions per legal domain across 7 domains. We distill the dataset using Llama 3 (70B) to transform explanations into a structured IRAC (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) format as a guided reasoning process to see if it results in better performance over the non-distilled dataset. We compare the non-fine-tuned models against their supervised fine-tuned (SFT) counterparts, trained for different sample sizes per domain, to study the effect on accuracy and prompt adherence. We also analyse option selection biases and their mitigation following SFT. In addition, we consolidate the performance across multiple variables: prompt type (few-shot vs zero-shot), answer ordering (chosen-option first vs generated-explanation first), response format (Numbered list vs Markdown vs JSON), and different decoding temperatures. Our findings show that domain-specific SFT helps some model configurations achieve close to human baseline performance, despite limited computational resources and a relatively small dataset. We release both the gathered SFT dataset and the family of Supervised Fine-tuned (SFT) adapters optimised for MBE performance. This establishes a practical lower bound on resources needed towards achieving effective legal question answering in smaller LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025 preprint, 9 pages, 3 figures, 16 appendix pages</p></details> |
| **[Contextualized Messages Boost Graph Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12529v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in recent years for their ability to process data that may be represented as graphs. This has prompted several studies to explore their representational capability based on the graph isomorphism task. Notably, these works inherently assume a countable node feature representation, potentially limiting their applicability. Interestingly, only a few study GNNs with uncountable node feature representation. In the paper, a new perspective on the representational capability of GNNs is investigated across all levels$\unicode{x2014}$node-level, neighborhood-level, and graph-level$\unicode{x2014}$when the space of node feature representation is uncountable. Specifically, the injective and metric requirements of previous works are softly relaxed by employing a pseudometric distance on the space of input to create a soft-injective function such that distinct inputs may produce similar outputs if and only if the pseudometric deems the inputs to be sufficiently similar on some representation. As a consequence, a simple and computationally efficient soft-isomorphic relational graph convolution network (SIR-GCN) that emphasizes the contextualized transformation of neighborhood feature representations via anisotropic and dynamic message functions is proposed. Furthermore, a mathematical discussion on the relationship between SIR-GCN and key GNNs in literature is laid out to put the contribution into context, establishing SIR-GCN as a generalization of classical GNN methodologies. To close, experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate the relative superiority of SIR-GCN, outperforming comparable models in node and graph property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Practical Acoustic Eavesdropping On Typed Passphrases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16719v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud services have become an essential infrastructure for enterprises and individuals. Access to these cloud services is typically governed by Identity and Access Management systems, where user authentication often relies on passwords. While best practices dictate the implementation of multi-factor authentication, it's a reality that many such users remain solely protected by passwords. This reliance on passwords creates a significant vulnerability, as these credentials can be compromised through various means, including side-channel attacks. This paper exploits keyboard acoustic emanations to infer typed natural language passphrases via unsupervised learning, necessitating no previous training data. Whilst this work focuses on short passphrases, it is also applicable to longer messages, such as confidential emails, where the margin for error is much greater, than with passphrases, making the attack even more effective in such a setting. Unlike traditional attacks that require physical access to the target device, acoustic side-channel attacks can be executed within the vicinity, without the user's knowledge, offering a worthwhile avenue for malicious actors. Our findings replicate and extend previous work, confirming that cross-correlation audio preprocessing outperforms methods like mel-frequency-cepstral coefficients and fast-fourier transforms in keystroke clustering. Moreover, we show that partial passphrase recovery through clustering and a dictionary attack can enable faster than brute-force attacks, further emphasizing the risks posed by this attack vector.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Traditional log parsing techniques often require manual configurations, such as defining log formats or labeling data, which limits scalability and usability. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing, offering potential improvements in automation and adaptability. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of these approaches since this is a relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This paper systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods, comparing their capabilities, limitations, and reliance on manual effort. We analyze the learning and prompt-engineering paradigms employed, efficiency- and effectiveness-enhancing techniques, and the role of LLMs in the parsing process. We aggregate the results of the survey in a large table comprising the characterizing features of LLM-based log parsing approaches and derive the general process of LLM-based log parsing, incorporating all reviewed approaches in a single flow chart. Additionally, we benchmark seven open-source LLM-based log parsers on public datasets and critically assess their reproducibility. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field and provide insights for researchers and practitioners seeking efficient and user-friendly log parsing solutions, with all code and results made publicly available for transparency.</p></details> | 34 pages, 11 figures |

However, designing these pipelines often involves significant manual work to ensure correctness. Recent advances in AI-based methods, which have shown strong capabilities in data tasks, such as text-to-SQL, present an opportunity to alleviate manual efforts in developing ELT pipelines. Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines. To fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines. ELT-Bench consists of 100 pipelines, including 835 source tables and 203 data models across various domains. By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows. AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage. We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the challenges of ELT-Bench and highlight the need for a more advanced AI agent to reduce manual effort in ELT workflows.

However, recent evidence indicates that LLMs can produce harmful content that violates social norms, raising significant concerns regarding the safety and ethical ramifications of deploying these advanced models. Thus, it is both critical and imperative to perform a rigorous and comprehensive safety evaluation of LLMs before deployment. Despite this need, owing to the extensiveness of LLM generation space, it still lacks a unified and standardized risk taxonomy to systematically reflect the LLM content safety, as well as automated safety assessment techniques to explore the potential risk efficiently. To bridge the striking gap, we propose S-Eval, a novel LLM-based automated Safety Evaluation framework with a newly defined comprehensive risk taxonomy. S-Eval incorporates two key components, i.e., an expert testing LLM ${M}_t$ and a novel safety critique LLM ${M}_c$. ${M}_t$ is responsible for automatically generating test cases in accordance with the proposed risk taxonomy. ${M}_c$ can provide quantitative and explainable safety evaluations for better risk awareness of LLMs. In contrast to prior works, S-Eval is efficient and effective in test generation and safety evaluation. Moreover, S-Eval can be flexibly configured and adapted to the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanying new safety threats, test generation methods and safety critique methods thanks to the LLM-based architecture. S-Eval has been deployed in our industrial partner for the automated safety evaluation of multiple LLMs serving millions of users, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/IS2Lab/S-Eval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA 2025</p></details> |

We proposed an efficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to experiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that integrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the underlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational data from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental data (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different domains are efficiently integrated by a couple of prior knowledge of chemistry, (1) the statistical ensemble, and (2) the relationship between source and target quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for the reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles data in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we confirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in accuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was achieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain transformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a full scratch model trained with over 100 target data. This result indicates that the proposed method leverages the high prediction performance with few target data, which helps to save the number of trials in real laboratories.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 19 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Among existing frameworks, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) outperform U-Net-based diffusion models in scalability and performance. However, while real-world scenarios often require concurrent execution of multiple instructions, step-by-step editing suffers from accumulated errors and degraded quality, and integrating multiple instructions with a single prompt usually results in incomplete edits due to instruction conflicts. We propose Instruction Influence Disentanglement (IID), a novel framework enabling parallel execution of multiple instructions in a single denoising process, designed for DiT-based models. By analyzing self-attention mechanisms in DiTs, we identify distinctive attention patterns in multi-instruction settings and derive instruction-specific attention masks to disentangle each instruction's influence. These masks guide the editing process to ensure localized modifications while preserving consistency in non-edited regions. Extensive experiments on open-source and custom datasets demonstrate that IID reduces diffusion steps while improving fidelity and instruction completion compared to existing baselines. The codes will be publicly released upon the acceptance of the paper.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has become an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital pathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features may not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption. In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is selected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using Google's pre-trained ViT. These features are then compressed via an autoencoder and used for unsupervised clustering and classification tasks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is applied to evaluate stratification into two and three risk groups. SHAP is used to identify key contributing features, which are mapped onto histopathological slices to provide spatial context. PATH-X demonstrates strong performance in breast and glioma cancers, where a sufficient number of WSIs enabled robust stratification. However, performance in lung cancer was limited due to data availability, emphasizing the need for larger datasets to enhance model reliability and clinical applicability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To address this issue, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and matrix factorization have been proposed; however, these compressed models are often highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We introduce the \textbf{Efficient Ensemble Defense (EED)} technique, which diversifies the compression of a single base model based on different pruning importance scores and enhances ensemble diversity to achieve high adversarial robustness and resource efficiency. EED dynamically determines the number of necessary sub-models during the inference stage, minimizing unnecessary computations while maintaining high robustness. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, EED demonstrated state-of-the-art robustness performance compared to existing adversarial pruning techniques, along with an inference speed improvement of up to 1.86 times. This proves that EED is a powerful defense solution in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |

They are extensively utilized for image representation, with pixel coordinates as input and pixel values as output. In contrast to prior works focusing on investigating the effect of the model's inside components (activation function, for instance), this work pioneers the exploration of the effect of kernel transformation of input/output while keeping the model itself unchanged. A byproduct of our findings is a simple yet effective method that combines scale and shift to significantly boost INR with negligible computation overhead. Moreover, we present two perspectives, depth and normalization, to interpret the performance benefits caused by scale and shift transformation. Overall, our work provides a new avenue for future works to understand and improve INR through the lens of kernel transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM) on December 20, 2024 (To appear on IEEE Website soon)</p></details> |

Text-based methods, which depend on textual descriptions of triples, often encounter difficulties when these descriptions lack sufficient information for accurate prediction-an issue inherent to the datasets and not easily resolved through modeling alone. To address this and ensure data consistency, we first use large language models (LLMs) to generate coherent descriptions, bridging the semantic gap between queries and answers. Secondly, we utilize inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby providing augmented training samples for KGC. Additionally, we employ the label information inherent in knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the existing contrastive framework, making it fully supervised. These efforts have led to significant performance improvements on the WN18RR and FB15k-237 datasets. According to standard evaluation metrics, our approach achieves a 4.2% improvement in Hit@1 on WN18RR and a 3.4% improvement in Hit@3 on FB15k-237, demonstrating superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |

However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Lakonik/GMFlow</p></details> |

This is challenging due to occlusions, depth ambiguities, and widely varying object shapes. Existing methods rely on 3D contact annotations collected via expensive motion-capture systems or tedious manual labeling, limiting scalability and generalization. To overcome this, InteractVLM harnesses the broad visual knowledge of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), fine-tuned with limited 3D contact data. However, directly applying these models is non-trivial, as they reason only in 2D, while human-object contact is inherently 3D. Thus we introduce a novel Render-Localize-Lift module that: (1) embeds 3D body and object surfaces in 2D space via multi-view rendering, (2) trains a novel multi-view localization model (MV-Loc) to infer contacts in 2D, and (3) lifts these to 3D. Additionally, we propose a new task called Semantic Human Contact estimation, where human contact predictions are conditioned explicitly on object semantics, enabling richer interaction modeling. InteractVLM outperforms existing work on contact estimation and also facilitates 3D reconstruction from an in-the wild image.

Animating Static Gaussian Scenes With Dynamic Weather Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05296v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting has recently enabled fast and photorealistic reconstruction of static 3D scenes. However, introducing dynamic elements that interact naturally with such static scenes remains challenging. Accordingly, we present a novel hybrid framework that combines Gaussian-particle representations for incorporating physically-based global weather effects into static 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes, correctly handling the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene. We follow a three-stage process: we first map static 3D Gaussians to a particle-based representation. We then introduce dynamic particles and simulate their motion using the Material Point Method (MPM). Finally, we map the simulated particles back to the Gaussian domain while introducing appearance parameters tailored for specific effects. To correctly handle the interactions of dynamic elements with the static scene, we introduce specialized collision handling techniques. Our approach supports a variety of weather effects, including snowfall, rainfall, fog, and sandstorms, and can also support falling objects, all with physically plausible motion and appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and physical realism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://galfiebelman.github.io/let-it-snow/</p></details> |

As LLMs become integral to clinical decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning. Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent provisionality of medical knowledge.</p></details> | 25 pages, 11 figures |

Accurately estimating the anomalous diffusion exponent and the diffusion coefficient from the particle trajectories is essential to distinguish between sub-diffusive, super-diffusive, or normal diffusion regimes. These estimates provide a deeper insight into the underlying dynamics of the system, facilitating the identification of particle behaviors and the detection of changes in diffusion states. However, analyzing short and noisy video data, which often yield incomplete and heterogeneous trajectories, poses a significant challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We introduce a data-driven method that integrates particle tracking, an attention U-Net architecture, and a change-point detection algorithm to address these issues. This approach not only infers the anomalous diffusion parameters with high accuracy but also identifies temporal transitions between different states, even in the presence of noise and limited temporal resolution. Our methodology demonstrated strong performance in the 2nd Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge benchmark within the top submissions for video tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving such problems, especially with sparse measurements and incomplete system information. However, PINNs face convergence issues, stability problems, overfitting, and complex loss function design. Here we introduce PINNverse, a training paradigm that addresses these limitations by reformulating the learning process as a constrained differential optimization problem. This approach achieves a dynamic balance between data loss and differential equation residual loss during training while preventing overfitting. PINNverse combines the advantages of PINNs with the Modified Differential Method of Multipliers to enable convergence on any point on the Pareto front. We demonstrate robust and accurate parameter estimation from noisy data in four classical ODE and PDE models from physics and biology. Our method enables accurate parameter inference also when the forward problem is expensive to solve.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Many existing approaches to automating prompt engineering rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce GReaTer, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates gradient information over task-specific reasoning. By utilizing task loss gradients, GReaTer enables self-optimization of prompts for open-source, lightweight language models without the need for costly closed-source LLMs. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks including BBH, GSM8k, and FOLIO demonstrate that GReaTer consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, GReaTer-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt optimization guided by gradients over reasoning.

Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.</p></details> | Under Review |

Specifically, existing methods have high computational demands, require detailed pose information, and cannot reconstruct occluded regions reliably. We introduce 6Img-to-3D, an efficient, scalable transformer-based encoder-renderer method for single-shot image to 3D reconstruction. Our method outputs a 3D-consistent parameterized triplane from only six outward-facing input images for large-scale, unbounded outdoor driving scenarios. We take a step towards resolving existing shortcomings by combining contracted custom cross- and self-attention mechanisms for triplane parameterization, differentiable volume rendering, scene contraction, and image feature projection. We showcase that six surround-view vehicle images from a single timestamp without global pose information are enough to reconstruct 360$^{\circ}$ scenes during inference time, taking 395 ms. Our method allows, for example, rendering third-person images and birds-eye views.

| **[The Curse of CoT: On the Limitations of Chain-of-Thought in In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05081v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been widely recognized for its ability to enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) through the generation of explicit explanatory rationales. However, our study reveals a surprising contradiction to this prevailing perspective. Through extensive experiments involving 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and nine diverse pattern-based in-context learning (ICL) datasets, we demonstrate that CoT and its reasoning variants consistently underperform direct answering across varying model scales and benchmark complexities. To systematically investigate this unexpected phenomenon, we designed extensive experiments to validate several hypothetical explanations. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental explicit-implicit duality driving CoT's performance in pattern-based ICL: while explicit reasoning falters due to LLMs' struggles to infer underlying patterns from demonstrations, implicit reasoning-disrupted by the increased contextual distance of CoT rationales-often compensates, delivering correct answers despite flawed rationales. This duality explains CoT's relative underperformance, as noise from weak explicit inference undermines the process, even as implicit mechanisms partially salvage outcomes. Notably, even long-CoT reasoning models, which excel in abstract and symbolic reasoning, fail to fully overcome these limitations despite higher computational costs. Our findings challenge existing assumptions regarding the universal efficacy of CoT, yielding novel insights into its limitations and guiding future research toward more nuanced and effective reasoning methodologies for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[On the Performance of an Explainable Language Model on PubMedQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05074v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant abilities in retrieving medical knowledge, reasoning over it and answering medical questions comparably to physicians. However, these models are not interpretable, hallucinate, are difficult to maintain and require enormous compute resources for training and inference. In this paper, we report results from Gyan, an explainable language model based on an alternative architecture, on the PubmedQA data set. The Gyan LLM is a compositional language model and the model is decoupled from knowledge. Gyan is trustable, transparent, does not hallucinate and does not require significant training or compute resources. Gyan is easily transferable across domains. Gyan-4.3 achieves SOTA results on PubmedQA with 87.1% accuracy compared to 82% by MedPrompt based on GPT-4 and 81.8% by Med-PaLM 2 (Google and DeepMind). We will be reporting results for other medical data sets - MedQA, MedMCQA, MMLU - Medicine in the future.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[DeltaProduct: Improving State-Tracking in Linear RNNs via Householder Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10297v4)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (linear RNNs) have emerged as competitive alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering efficient training and linear-time inference. However, existing architectures face a fundamental trade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of their state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures like Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited expressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet and RWKV-7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous token-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a slight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of DeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per token on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead takes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus rank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized Householder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance expressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking and language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved length extrapolation compared to DeltaNet. Additionally, we also strengthen the theoretical foundation of DeltaNet by proving that it can solve dihedral group word problems in just two layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |

This paper provides a straightforward approach to address multi-UAV tracking in thermal infrared video, leveraging recent advances in detection and tracking. Instead of relying on the well-established YOLOv5 with DeepSORT combination, we present a tracking framework built on YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT, enhanced with tailored training and inference strategies. We evaluate our approach following the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge metrics and reach competitive performance. Notably, we achieved strong results without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, highlighting our approach as a "Strong Baseline" for multi-UAV tracking tasks. We provide implementation details, in-depth experimental analysis, and a discussion of potential improvements.

Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 WDFM-AD |
| **[Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05004v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC) is a sample-efficient method for approximate Bayesian inference with computationally expensive likelihoods. While VBMC's local surrogate approach provides stable approximations, its conservative exploration strategy and limited evaluation budget can cause it to miss regions of complex posteriors. In this work, we introduce Stacking Variational Bayesian Monte Carlo (S-VBMC), a method that constructs global posterior approximations by merging independent VBMC runs through a principled and inexpensive post-processing step. Our approach leverages VBMC's mixture posterior representation and per-component evidence estimates, requiring no additional likelihood evaluations while being naturally parallelizable. We demonstrate S-VBMC's effectiveness on two synthetic problems designed to challenge VBMC's exploration capabilities and two real-world applications from computational neuroscience, showing substantial improvements in posterior approximation quality across all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Workshop track of the 7th Symposium in Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference (AABI 2025). 24 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[REWIND: Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion with Exemplar-Based Identity Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04956v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present REWIND (Real-Time Egocentric Whole-Body Motion Diffusion), a one-step diffusion model for real-time, high-fidelity human motion estimation from egocentric image inputs. While an existing method for egocentric whole-body (i.e., body and hands) motion estimation is non-real-time and acausal due to diffusion-based iterative motion refinement to capture correlations between body and hand poses, REWIND operates in a fully causal and real-time manner. To enable real-time inference, we introduce (1) cascaded body-hand denoising diffusion, which effectively models the correlation between egocentric body and hand motions in a fast, feed-forward manner, and (2) diffusion distillation, which enables high-quality motion estimation with a single denoising step. Our denoising diffusion model is based on a modified Transformer architecture, designed to causally model output motions while enhancing generalizability to unseen motion lengths. Additionally, REWIND optionally supports identity-conditioned motion estimation when identity prior is available. To this end, we propose a novel identity conditioning method based on a small set of pose exemplars of the target identity, which further enhances motion estimation quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that REWIND significantly outperforms the existing baselines both with and without exemplar-based identity conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025, project page: https://jyunlee.github.io/projects/rewind/</p></details> |
| **[Practical Acoustic Eavesdropping On Typed Passphrases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16719v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud services have become an essential infrastructure for enterprises and individuals. Access to these cloud services is typically governed by Identity and Access Management systems, where user authentication often relies on passwords. While best practices dictate the implementation of multi-factor authentication, it's a reality that many such users remain solely protected by passwords. This reliance on passwords creates a significant vulnerability, as these credentials can be compromised through various means, including side-channel attacks. This paper exploits keyboard acoustic emanations to infer typed natural language passphrases via unsupervised learning, necessitating no previous training data. Whilst this work focuses on short passphrases, it is also applicable to longer messages, such as confidential emails, where the margin for error is much greater, than with passphrases, making the attack even more effective in such a setting. Unlike traditional attacks that require physical access to the target device, acoustic side-channel attacks can be executed within the vicinity, without the user's knowledge, offering a worthwhile avenue for malicious actors. Our findings replicate and extend previous work, confirming that cross-correlation audio preprocessing outperforms methods like mel-frequency-cepstral coefficients and fast-fourier transforms in keystroke clustering. Moreover, we show that partial passphrase recovery through clustering and a dictionary attack can enable faster than brute-force attacks, further emphasizing the risks posed by this attack vector.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Existing DSA implementations bypass the theoretical state-of-the-art algorithms in favor of either fast but wasteful heuristics, or memory-efficient approaches that do not scale beyond one thousand buffers. The "AI memory wall", combined with deep neural networks' static architecture, has reignited interest in DSA. We present idealloc, a low-fragmentation, high-performance DSA implementation designed for million-buffer instances. Evaluated on a novel suite of particularly hard benchmarks from several domains, idealloc ranks first against four production implementations in terms of a joint effectiveness/robustness criterion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM TOPLAS</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Network-Guided Covariate Selection for High-Dimensional Data Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04866v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When integrating datasets from different studies, it is common that they have components of different formats. How to combine them organically for improved estimation is important and challenging. This paper investigates this problem in a two-study scenario, where covariates are observed for all subjects, but network data is available in only one study, and response variables are available only in the other. To leverage the partially observed network information, we propose the Network-Guided Covariate Selection (NGCS) algorithm. It integrates the spectral information from network adjacency matrices with the Higher Criticism Thresholding approach for informative covariates identification. Theoretically, we prove that NGCS achieves the optimal rate in covariate selection, which is the same rate in the supervised learning setting. Furthermore, this optimality is robust to network models and tuning parameters. This framework extends naturally to clustering and regression tasks, with two proposed algorithms: NG-clu and NG-reg. For clustering, NG-clu accurately clusters data points despite incomplete network information. For regression, NG-reg enhances predictive performance by incorporating latent covariate structures inferred from network data. Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of our algorithms, underscoring their effectiveness in handling heterogeneous data formats.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[MetaSC: Test-Time Safety Specification Optimization for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07985v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel dynamic safety framework that optimizes language model (LM) safety reasoning at inference time without modifying model weights. Building on recent advances in self-critique methods, our approach leverages a meta-critique mechanism that iteratively updates safety prompts-termed specifications-to drive the critique and revision process adaptively. This test-time optimization not only improves performance against adversarial jailbreak requests but also in diverse general safety-related tasks, such as avoiding moral harm or pursuing honest responses. Our empirical evaluations across several language models demonstrate that dynamically optimized safety prompts yield significantly higher safety scores compared to fixed system prompts and static self-critique defenses.

| **[Efficient Hamiltonian, structure and trace distance learning of Gaussian states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03163v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we initiate the study of Hamiltonian learning for positive temperature bosonic Gaussian states, the quantum generalization of the widely studied problem of learning Gaussian graphical models. We obtain efficient protocols, both in sample and computational complexity, for the task of inferring the parameters of their underlying quadratic Hamiltonian under the assumption of bounded temperature, squeezing, displacement and maximal degree of the interaction graph. Our protocol only requires heterodyne measurements, which are often experimentally feasible, and has a sample complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of modes. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to learn the underlying interaction graph in a similar setting and sample complexity. Taken together, our results put the status of the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem for continuous variable systems in a more advanced state when compared to spins, where state-of-the-art results are either unavailable or quantitatively inferior to ours. In addition, we use our techniques to obtain the first results on learning Gaussian states in trace distance with a quadratic scaling in precision and polynomial in the number of modes, albeit imposing certain restrictions on the Gaussian states. Our main technical innovations are several continuity bounds for the covariance and Hamiltonian matrix of a Gaussian state, which are of independent interest, combined with what we call the local inversion technique. In essence, the local inversion technique allows us to reliably infer the Hamiltonian of a Gaussian state by only estimating in parallel submatrices of the covariance matrix whose size scales with the desired precision, but not the number of modes. This way we bypass the need to obtain precise global estimates of the covariance matrix, controlling the sample complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 1 figure.

| **[Data Augmentation as Free Lunch: Exploring the Test-Time Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04843v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation has become a promising method of mitigating data sparsity in sequential recommendation. Existing methods generate new yet effective data during model training to improve performance. However, deploying them requires retraining, architecture modification, or introducing additional learnable parameters. The above steps are time-consuming and costly for well-trained models, especially when the model scale becomes large. In this work, we explore the test-time augmentation (TTA) for sequential recommendation, which augments the inputs during the model inference and then aggregates the model's predictions for augmented data to improve final accuracy. It avoids significant time and cost overhead from loss calculation and backward propagation. We first experimentally disclose the potential of existing augmentation operators for TTA and find that the Mask and Substitute consistently achieve better performance. Further analysis reveals that these two operators are effective because they retain the original sequential pattern while adding appropriate perturbations. Meanwhile, we argue that these two operators still face time-consuming item selection or interference information from mask tokens. Based on the analysis and limitations, we present TNoise and TMask. The former injects uniform noise into the original representation, avoiding the computational overhead of item selection. The latter blocks mask token from participating in model calculations or directly removes interactions that should have been replaced with mask tokens. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our method. We provide an anonymous implementation at https://github.com/KingGugu/TTA4SR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Causal Framework for Evaluating Deferring Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18902v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deferring systems extend supervised Machine Learning (ML) models with the possibility to defer predictions to human experts. However, evaluating the impact of a deferring strategy on system accuracy is still an overlooked area. This paper fills this gap by evaluating deferring systems through a causal lens. We link the potential outcomes framework for causal inference with deferring systems, which allows to identify the causal impact of the deferring strategy on predictive accuracy. We distinguish two scenarios. In the first one, we have access to both the human and ML model predictions for the deferred instances. Here, we can identify the individual causal effects for deferred instances and the aggregates of them. In the second one, only human predictions are available for the deferred instances. Here, we can resort to regression discontinuity designs to estimate a local causal effect. We evaluate our approach on synthetic and real datasets for seven deferring systems from the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |

Our method is based on an approach of H\'ebrard and Katsirelos (2020) that employs a propagator to enforce transitivity constraints, incorporate lower bounds for search tree pruning, and enable inferred propagations. We leverage the recently introduced IPASIR-UP interface for CaDiCal to implement these techniques with a SAT solver. Furthermore, we propose new features that take advantage of the underlying SAT solver. These include modifying the integrated decision strategy with vertex domination hints and using incremental bottom-up search that allows to reuse learned clauses from previous calls. Additionally, we integrate a more efficient clique computation to improve the lower bounds during the search. We validate the effectiveness of each new feature through an experimental analysis. ZykovColor outperforms other state-of-the-art graph coloring implementations on the DIMACS benchmark set. Further experiments on random Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs show that our new approach dominates state-of-the-art SAT-based methods for both very sparse and highly dense graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures, 2 tables, source code published at https://github.com/trewes/ZykovColor</p></details> |

A key challenge for classical path planning algorithms used for autonomous information gathering is adaptively replanning paths online as the terrain is explored given limited onboard compute resources. Recently, learning-based approaches emerged that train planning policies offline and enable computationally efficient online replanning performing policy inference. These approaches are designed and trained for terrain monitoring missions assuming a single specific map representation, which limits their applicability to different terrains. To address these issues, we propose a novel formulation of the adaptive informative path planning problem unified across different map representations, enabling training and deploying planning policies in a larger variety of monitoring missions. Experimental results validate that our novel formulation easily integrates with classical non-learning-based planning approaches while maintaining their performance. Our trained planning policy performs similarly to state-of-the-art map-specifically trained policies. We validate our learned policy on unseen real-world terrain datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

This paper focuses on its fast numerical implementation, which is challenging due to the non-differentiability of the objective function and the non-uniqueness of the minimizer. We derive a hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equation from the subdifferential of the $p$-Laplacian regularization. A simplified equation that is mathematically well-posed and computationally efficient is proposed as an alternative. Numerical experiments verify that the simplified $p$-Laplacian equation suppresses spiky solutions in data interpolation and improves classification accuracy in semi-supervised learning. The remarkably low computational cost enables further applications.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Our focus is on directly inferring a set of causal factors without requiring full causal graph reconstruction, which is computationally challenging in large-scale systems. The identified causal set consists of all potential regulators of the target variable under experimental settings, enabling efficient regulation when intervention costs and feasibility vary across variables. To achieve this, we train a neural network using supervised learning on simulated data to infer causality. By employing a local-inference strategy, our approach scales with linear complexity in the number of variables, efficiently scaling up to thousands of variables. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance in identifying causal relationships within large-scale gene regulatory networks, outperforming existing methods that emphasize full-graph discovery. We validate our model's generalization capability across out-of-distribution graph structures and generating mechanisms, including gene regulatory networks of E. coli and the human K562 cell line.

To address this issue, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and matrix factorization have been proposed; however, these compressed models are often highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We introduce the \textbf{Efficient Ensemble Defense (EED)} technique, which diversifies the compression of a single base model based on different pruning importance scores and enhances ensemble diversity to achieve high adversarial robustness and resource efficiency. EED dynamically determines the number of necessary sub-models during the inference stage, minimizing unnecessary computations while maintaining high robustness. On the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets, EED demonstrated state-of-the-art robustness performance compared to existing adversarial pruning techniques, along with an inference speed improvement of up to 1.86 times. This proves that EED is a powerful defense solution in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Bridging Knowledge Gap Between Image Inpainting and Large-Area Visible Watermark Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04687v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible watermark removal which involves watermark cleaning and background content restoration is pivotal to evaluate the resilience of watermarks. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based models still struggle with large-area watermarks and are overly dependent on the quality of watermark mask prediction. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel feature adapting framework that leverages the representation modeling capacity of a pre-trained image inpainting model. Our approach bridges the knowledge gap between image inpainting and watermark removal by fusing information of the residual background content beneath watermarks into the inpainting backbone model. We establish a dual-branch system to capture and embed features from the residual background content, which are merged into intermediate features of the inpainting backbone model via gated feature fusion modules. Moreover, for relieving the dependence on high-quality watermark masks, we introduce a new training paradigm by utilizing coarse watermark masks to guide the inference process. This contributes to a visible image removal model which is insensitive to the quality of watermark mask during testing. Extensive experiments on both a large-scale synthesized dataset and a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

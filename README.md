Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

| **[LiteReality: Graphics-Ready 3D Scene Reconstruction from RGB-D Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02861v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas. LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials, and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact, editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark, along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets.

| **[Less is Enough: Training-Free Video Diffusion Acceleration via Runtime-Adaptive Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02860v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications.

| **[Bootstrapping Grounded Chain-of-Thought in Multimodal LLMs for Data-Efficient Model Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02859v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs, i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps. To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e., bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables, receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[Requirements Elicitation Follow-Up Question Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02858v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interviews are a widely used technique in eliciting requirements to gather stakeholder needs, preferences, and expectations for a software system. Effective interviewing requires skilled interviewers to formulate appropriate interview questions in real time while facing multiple challenges, including lack of familiarity with the domain, excessive cognitive load, and information overload that hinders how humans process stakeholders' speech. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance in multiple natural language processing tasks, including text summarization and entailment. To support interviewers, we investigate the application of GPT-4o to generate follow-up interview questions during requirements elicitation by building on a framework of common interviewer mistake types. In addition, we describe methods to generate questions based on interviewee speech. We report a controlled experiment to evaluate LLM-generated and human-authored questions with minimal guidance, and a second controlled experiment to evaluate the LLM-generated questions when generation is guided by interviewer mistake types. Our findings demonstrate that, for both experiments, the LLM-generated questions are no worse than the human-authored questions with respect to clarity, relevancy, and informativeness. In addition, LLM-generated questions outperform human-authored questions when guided by common mistakes types. This highlights the potential of using LLMs to help interviewers improve the quality and ease of requirements elicitation interviews in real time.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering 2025</p></details> |
| **[Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02856v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate. However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading. Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, Code is available at https://github.com/nikhilchandak/answer-matching</p></details> |
| **[AnyI2V: Animating Any Conditional Image with Motion Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02857v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models, have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content. Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video generation.

| **[Urban Region Pre-training and Prompting: A Graph-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05920v4)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban region representation is crucial for various urban downstream tasks. However, despite the proliferation of methods and their success, acquiring general urban region knowledge and adapting to different tasks remains challenging. Existing work pays limited attention to the fine-grained functional layout semantics in urban regions, limiting their ability to capture transferable knowledge across regions. Further, inadequate handling of the unique features and relationships required for different downstream tasks may also hinder effective task adaptation. In this paper, we propose a $\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{U}$rban $\textbf{R}$egion $\textbf{P}$re-training and $\textbf{P}$rompting framework ($\textbf{GURPP}$) for region representation learning. Specifically, we first construct an urban region graph and develop a subgraph-centric urban region pre-training model to capture the heterogeneous and transferable patterns of entity interactions. This model pre-trains knowledge-rich region embeddings using contrastive learning and multi-view learning methods. To further refine these representations, we design two graph-based prompting methods: a manually-defined prompt to incorporate explicit task knowledge and a task-learnable prompt to discover hidden knowledge, which enhances the adaptability of these embeddings to different tasks. Extensive experiments on various urban region prediction tasks and different cities demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2025 |
| **[MvHo-IB: Multi-View Higher-Order Information Bottleneck for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02847v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods, including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI-25, code is available at \url{https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB}</p></details> |
| **[Visual Contextual Attack: Jailbreaking MLLMs with Image-Driven Context Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02844v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs. However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs. Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The code is available at https://github.com/Dtc7w3PQ/Visco-Attack.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Improved Unbiased Watermark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11268v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence surpasses human capabilities in text generation, the necessity to authenticate the origins of AI-generated content has become paramount. Unbiased watermarks offer a powerful solution by embedding statistical signals into language model-generated text without distorting the quality. In this paper, we introduce MCmark, a family of unbiased, Multi-Channel-based watermarks. MCmark works by partitioning the model's vocabulary into segments and promoting token probabilities within a selected segment based on a watermark key. We demonstrate that MCmark not only preserves the original distribution of the language model but also offers significant improvements in detectability and robustness over existing unbiased watermarks. Our experiments with widely-used language models demonstrate an improvement in detectability of over 10% using MCmark, compared to existing state-of-the-art unbiased watermarks. This advancement underscores MCmark's potential in enhancing the practical application of watermarking in AI-generated texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Towards autonomous photogrammetric forest inventory using a lightweight under-canopy robotic drone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12073v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote sensing data, supporting enhanced monitoring, assessment, and decision-making processes. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on manual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently, advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone utilizing state-of-the-art open-source methods and validating its performance for data collection inside forests. Specifically, the study focused on camera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric post-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera. The autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through multiple test flights at boreal forests. The tree parameter estimation capability was studied by performing diameter at breast height (DBH) estimation. The prototype successfully carried out flights in selected challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed excellent performance in forest 3D modeling with a miniaturized stereoscopic photogrammetric system. The DBH estimation achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.33 cm (12.79 \%) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than 30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 cm (5.74 \%). The results provide valuable insights into autonomous under-canopy forest mapping and highlight the critical next steps for advancing lightweight robotic drone systems for mapping complex forest environments.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 Figures |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks as Privacy Tools: Reliability, Disparity and Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13972v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a significant threat to the privacy of machine learning models and are widely used as tools for privacy assessment, auditing, and machine unlearning. While prior MIA research has primarily focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, To appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02833v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial factor for successful human and AI interaction is the ability of language models or chatbots to follow human instructions precisely. A common feature of instructions are output constraints like ``only answer with yes or no" or ``mention the word `abrakadabra' at least 3 times" that the user adds to craft a more useful answer. Even today's strongest models struggle with fulfilling such constraints. We find that most models strongly overfit on a small set of verifiable constraints from the benchmarks that test these abilities, a skill called precise instruction following, and are not able to generalize well to unseen output constraints. We introduce a new benchmark, IFBench, to evaluate precise instruction following generalization on 58 new, diverse, and challenging verifiable out-of-domain constraints. In addition, we perform an extensive analysis of how and on what data models can be trained to improve precise instruction following generalization. Specifically, we carefully design constraint verification modules and show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) significantly improves instruction following. In addition to IFBench, we release 29 additional new hand-annotated training constraints and verification functions, RLVR training prompts, and code.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Agentic Business Process Management: Practitioner Perspectives on Agent Governance in Business Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03693v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of generative AI, industry interest in software agents is growing. Given the stochastic nature of generative AI-based agents, their effective and safe deployment in organizations requires robust governance, which can be facilitated by agentic business process management. However, given the nascence of this new-generation agent notion, it is not clear what BPM practitioners consider to be an agent, and what benefits, risks and governance challenges they associate with agent deployments. To investigate how organizations can effectively govern AI agents, we conducted a qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with 22 BPM practitioners from diverse industries. They anticipate that agents will enhance efficiency, improve data quality, ensure better compliance, and boost scalability through automation, while also cautioning against risks such as bias, over-reliance, cybersecurity threats, job displacement, and ambiguous decision-making. To address these challenges, the study presents six key recommendations for the responsible adoption of AI agents: define clear business goals, set legal and ethical guardrails, establish human-agent collaboration, customize agent behavior, manage risks, and ensure safe integration with fallback options. Additionally, the paper outlines actions to align traditional BPM with agentic AI, including balancing human and agent roles, redefining human involvement, adapting process structures, and introducing performance metrics. These insights provide a practical foundation for integrating AI agents into business processes while preserving oversight, flexibility, and trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Responsible BPM 2025, 15 pages including references</p></details> |
| **[Designs from magic-augmented Clifford circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02828v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</p></details> | 59 pages |
| **[Large Language Model-Driven Closed-Loop UAV Operation with Semantic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01930v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent operation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21171v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a journal for possible publication</p></details> |

In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted by IEEE Globecom 2024 Workshops</p></details> |
| **[On the Smoothed Complexity of Combinatorial Local Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07547v5)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a unifying framework for smoothed analysis of combinatorial local optimization problems, and show how a diverse selection of problems within the complexity class PLS can be cast within this model. This abstraction allows us to identify key structural properties, and corresponding parameters, that determine the smoothed running time of local search dynamics. We formalize this via a black-box tool that provides concrete bounds on the expected maximum number of steps needed until local search reaches an exact local optimum. This bound is particularly strong, in the sense that it holds for any starting feasible solution, any choice of pivoting rule, and does not rely on the choice of specific noise distributions that are applied on the input, but it is parameterized by just a global upper bound $\phi$ on the probability density. The power of this tool can be demonstrated by instantiating it for various PLS-hard problems of interest to derive efficient smoothed running times (as a function of $\phi$ and the input size). Most notably, we focus on the important local optimization problem of finding pure Nash equilibria in Congestion Games, that has not been studied before from a smoothed analysis perspective. Specifically, we propose novel smoothed analysis models for general and Network Congestion Games, under various representations, including explicit, step-function, and polynomial resource latencies. We study PLS-hard instances of these problems and show that their standard local search algorithms run in polynomial smoothed time. Finally, we present further applications of our framework to a wide range of additional combinatorial problems, including local Max-Cut in weighted graphs, the Travelling Salesman problem (TSP) under the $k$-opt local heuristic, and finding pure equilibria in Network Coordination Games.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Mathematics of Operations Research</p></details> |

Recent developments have achieved this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information. However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics (segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC), trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining. Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.

We analyze prior tiering systems and observe two challenges for high-performance memory tiering: adapting to skewed but dynamically varying data hotness distributions while minimizing memory and cache overhead due to tiering. To address these challenges, we propose HybridTier, an adaptive and lightweight tiering system for CXL memory. HybridTier tracks both long-term data access frequency and short-term access momentum \emph{simultaneously} to accurately capture and adapt to shifting hotness distributions. HybridTier reduces the metadata memory overhead by tracking data accesses \emph{probabilistically}, obtaining higher memory efficiency by trading off a small amount of tracking inaccuracy that has a negligible impact on application performance. To reduce cache overhead, HybridTier uses lightweight data structures that optimize for data locality to track data hotness. Our evaluations show that HybridTier outperforms prior systems by up to $91\%$ ($19\%$ geomean), incurring $2.0-7.8\times$ less memory overhead and $1.7-3.5\times$ less cache misses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in the Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 3 (ASPLOS 25)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with Diverse Solving Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02804v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) has notably enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in mathematical domains. However, current multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for mathematical reasoning often rely on one-to-one image-text pairs and single-solution supervision, overlooking the diversity of valid reasoning perspectives and internal reflections. In this work, we introduce MathV-DP, a novel dataset that captures multiple diverse solution trajectories for each image-question pair, fostering richer reasoning supervision. We further propose Qwen-VL-DP, a model built upon Qwen-VL, fine-tuned with supervised learning and enhanced via group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-based RL approach that integrates correctness discrimination and diversity-aware reward functions. Our method emphasizes learning from varied reasoning perspectives and distinguishing between correct yet distinct solutions. Extensive experiments on the MathVista's minitest and Math-V benchmarks demonstrate that Qwen-VL-DP significantly outperforms prior base MLLMs in both accuracy and generative diversity, highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives and reflective reasoning in multimodal mathematical reasoning.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gserifi.github.io/HyperGaussians</p></details> |

We investigate surrogate model training for improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AutoML 25, Project page at: https://shiwenqin.github.io/TransferrableSurrogate/</p></details> |

To accelerate algorithmic progress, a recent benchmark released intracranial recordings from a paralyzed participant attempting to speak, along with a baseline decoding algorithm. Prior work on the benchmark showed impressive accuracy gains. However, these gains increased computational costs and were not demonstrated in a real-time decoding setting. Here, we make three contributions that pave the way towards accurate, efficient, and real-time neural speech decoding. First, we incorporate large amounts of time masking during training. On average, over $50\%$ of each trial is masked. Second, we replace the gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture used in the baseline algorithm with a compact Transformer. The Transformer architecture uses $77\%$ fewer parameters, cuts peak GPU memory usage by $36\%$ relative, and is significantly faster to calibrate relative to the GRU. Third, we design a lightweight variant of an existing test-time adaptation method developed for decoding handwriting from neural activity. Our variant adapts the model using multiple time masked augmentations of a single trial and requires only one gradient step per trial. Together, these contributions reduce word error rate by $19.5\%$ and effectively mitigate performance degradations across held-out days in a real-time decoding setting while substantially lowering computational costs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Training-Free Reference-Based Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02798v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</p></details> | Preprint |

However, to maintain this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead. Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter. Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA) 2025</p></details> |

| **[Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic 'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences, unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback. Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving their reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> | 31 pages, 18 figures |
| **[LLM-Powered Prediction of Hyperglycemia and Discovery of Behavioral Treatment Pathways from Wearables and Diet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03935v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Postprandial hyperglycemia, marked by the blood glucose level exceeding the normal range after consuming a meal, is a critical indicator of progression toward type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes and in healthy individuals. A key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the postprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance based on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity level, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could allow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal glucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning solution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data processing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to predict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and recent glucose patterns. We used data obtained from wearables in a five-week clinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the proposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data, and machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from wearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work logs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose pattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology provides a 16% better performance level compared to the comparison models. Additionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 73.3% and an F1 score of 0.716 and recommends different treatment options to help avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations.

| **[Grounding Intelligence in Movement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02771v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems: movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact, lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs. Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Avoiding Catastrophe in Online Learning by Asking for Help](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08062v5)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume that all mistakes are recoverable and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors. This approach is problematic when some mistakes are "catastrophic", i.e., irreparable. We propose an online learning problem where the goal is to minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff in each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe in that round and try to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe) while allowing a limited number of queries to a mentor. We also assume that the agent can transfer knowledge between similar inputs. We first show that in general, any algorithm either queries the mentor at a linear rate or is nearly guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, in settings where the mentor policy class is learnable in the standard online model, we provide an algorithm whose regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon grows. Although our focus is the product of payoffs, we provide matching bounds for the typical additive regret. Conceptually, if a policy class is learnable in the absence of catastrophic risk, it is learnable in the presence of catastrophic risk if the agent can ask for help.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

Recent LALMs typically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by training on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction datasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic forgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we revisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated cross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own training targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency while establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot generalization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct DeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training samples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets, including speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of audio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA, Speech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate that our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction and training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data construction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building robust, general-purpose LALMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model and code available at: https://github.com/kehanlu/DeSTA2.5-Audio</p></details> |

In this framework, the would and the might conditional operators are no longer interdefinable. The intuitionistic conditional logics considered in the literature are defined by setting Chellas' conditional logic CK, whose semantics is defined using selection functions, within the constructive and intuitionistic framework introduced for intuitionistic modal logics. This operation gives rise to a constructive and an intuitionistic variant of (might-free-) CK, which we call CCKbox and IntCK respectively. Building on the proof systems defined for CK and for intuitionistic modal logics, in this paper we introduce a nested calculus for IntCK and a sequent calculus for CCKbox. Based on the sequent calculus, we define CCK, a conservative extension of Weiss' logic CCKbox with the might operator. We introduce a class of models and an axiomatization for CCK, and extend these result to several extensions of CCK.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft.

To address this limitation, we present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in agricultural research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Elvis...</summary><p>Elvis Kimara and Mozhgan Hadadi contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications.

However, effectively extracting and utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods, including recent hypergraph-based techniques.

However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted by IEEE Globecom 2024 Workshops</p></details> |

| **[Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic 'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences, unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback. Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving their reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> | 31 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Fast and Simplex: 2-Simplicial Attention in Triton](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02754v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize token efficiency. In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that $2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, with appendix 25 pages</p></details> |
| **[Linear Attention with Global Context: A Multipole Attention Mechanism for Vision and Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02748v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks, from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work, we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in $n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator (MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECLR Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Indexing Tries within Entropy-Bounded Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02728v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of indexing and compressing tries using a BWT-based approach. Specifically, we consider a succinct and compressed representation of the XBWT of Ferragina et al.\ [FOCS '05, JACM '09] corresponding to the analogous of the FM-index [FOCS '00, JACM '05] for tries. This representation allows to efficiently count the number of nodes reached by a given string pattern. To analyze the space complexity of the above trie index, we propose a proof for the combinatorial problem of counting the number of tries with a given symbol distribution. We use this formula to define a worst-case entropy measure for tries, as well as a notion of k-th order empirical entropy. In particular, we show that the relationships between these two entropy measures are similar to those between the corresponding well-known measures for strings. We use these measures to prove that the XBWT of a trie can be encoded within a space bounded by our k-th order empirical entropy plus a o(n) term, with n being the number of nodes in the trie. Notably, as happens for strings, this space bound can be reached for every sufficiently small k simultaneously. Finally, we compare the space complexity of the above index with that of the r-index for tries proposed by Prezza [SODA '21] and we prove that in some cases the FM-index for tries is asymptotically smaller.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, submitted to SPIRE 2025</p></details> |
| **[AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01961v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://ac-dit.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Faster Algorithm for Bounded Tree Edit Distance in the Low-Distance Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02701v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tree edit distance is a natural dissimilarity measure between rooted ordered trees whose nodes are labeled over an alphabet $\Sigma$. It is defined as the minimum number of node edits (insertions, deletions, and relabelings) required to transform one tree into the other. In the weighted variant, the edits have associated costs (depending on the involved node labels) normalized so that each cost is at least one, and the goal is to minimize the total cost of edits. The unweighted tree edit distance between two trees of total size $n$ can be computed in $O(n^{2.6857})$ time; in contrast, determining the weighted tree edit distance is fine-grained equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem and requires $n^3/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$ time [Nogler et al.; STOC'25]. These super-quadratic running times are unattractive for large but very similar trees, which motivates the bounded version of the problem, where the runtime is parameterized by the computed distance $k$, potentially yielding faster algorithms for $k\ll n$. Previous best algorithms for the bounded unweighted setting run in $O(nk^2\log n)$ time [Akmal & Jin; ICALP'21] and $O(n + k^7\log k)$ time [Das et al.; STOC'23]. For the weighted variant, the only known running time has been $O(n + k^{15})$. We present an $O(n + k^6\log k)$-time algorithm for computing the bounded tree edit distance in both the weighted and unweighted settings. Our approach begins with an alternative $O(nk^2\log n)$-time algorithm that handles weights and is significantly easier to analyze than the existing counterpart. We then introduce a novel optimization that leverages periodic structures within the input trees. To utilize it, we modify the $O(k^5)$-size $O(n)$-time universal kernel, the central component of the prior $O(n + k^{O(1)})$-time algorithms, so that it produces instances containing these periodic structures.</p></details> | Accepted to ESA 2025 |
| **[RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/Joker3993/RLHGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

While prior surveys focus on developments before 2023, this work comprehensively reviews recent advances, emphasizing scalability to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. We categorize progress into a few key methodologies: trajectory matching, gradient matching, distribution matching, scalable generative approaches, and decoupling optimization mechanisms. As a comprehensive examination of recent dataset distillation advances, this survey highlights breakthrough innovations: the SRe2L framework for efficient and effective condensation, soft label strategies that significantly enhance model accuracy, and lossless distillation techniques that maximize compression while maintaining performance. Beyond these methodological advancements, we address critical challenges, including robustness against adversarial and backdoor attacks, effective handling of non-IID data distributions. Additionally, we explore emerging applications in video and audio processing, multi-modal learning, medical imaging, and scientific computing, highlighting its domain versatility. By offering extensive performance comparisons and actionable research directions, this survey equips researchers and practitioners with practical insights to advance efficient and generalizable dataset distillation, paving the way for future innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Dr. J...</summary><p>Dr. Jiawei Du is the corresponding author</p></details> |

Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages |

In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer, while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop decluttering tasks.

To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism, which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting (98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1% accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio tasks, paving the way for broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech2025</p></details> |

Agentic AI-based Hardware Design & Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02660v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately performing end-to-end hardware design and verification.

This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work, we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.</p></details> | 12+8 pages |

Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall.

To solve these issues, we clarify the objective and references for weakly supervised ultrasound image segmentation, presenting a framework with high-confidence pseudo-labels to represent topological and anatomical information and high-rationality losses to capture multi-level discriminative features. Specifically, we fuse geometric transformations of four-point annotations and MedSAM model results prompted by specific annotations to generate high-confidence box, foreground, and background labels. Our high-rationality learning strategy includes: 1) Alignment loss measuring spatial consistency between segmentation and box label, and topological continuity within the foreground label, guiding the network to perceive nodule location; 2) Contrastive loss pulling features from labeled foreground regions while pushing features from labeled foreground and background regions, guiding the network to learn nodule and background feature distribution; 3) Prototype correlation loss measuring consistency between correlation maps derived by comparing features with foreground and background prototypes, refining uncertain regions to accurate nodule edges. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TN3K and DDTI datasets.

We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data, AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While voxelization is the most common of them, meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a framework that joins the three representations under differentiable transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit. Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Lightweight Structure-Aware Attention for Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16289v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy, and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs) as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Bounded Weighted Edit Distance: Dynamic Algorithms and Matching Lower Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02548v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The edit distance $ed(X,Y)$ of two strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^*$ is the minimum number of character edits (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) needed to transform $X$ into $Y$. Its weighted counterpart $ed^w(X,Y)$ minimizes the total cost of edits, which are specified using a function $w$, normalized so that each edit costs at least one. The textbook dynamic-programming procedure, given strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^{\le n}$ and oracle access to $w$, computes $ed^w(X,Y)$ in $O(n^2)$ time. Nevertheless, one can achieve better running times if the computed distance, denoted $k$, is small: $O(n+k^2)$ for unit weights [Landau and Vishkin; JCSS'88] and $\tilde{O}(n+\sqrt{nk^3})$ for arbitrary weights [Cassis, Kociumaka, Wellnitz; FOCS'23]. In this paper, we study the dynamic version of the weighted edit distance problem, where the goal is to maintain $ed^w(X,Y)$ for strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^{\le n}$ that change over time, with each update specified as an edit in $X$ or $Y$. Very recently, Gorbachev and Kociumaka [STOC'25] showed that the unweighted distance $ed(X,Y)$ can be maintained in $\tilde{O}(k)$ time per update after $\tilde{O}(n+k^2)$-time preprocessing; here, $k$ denotes the current value of $ed(X,Y)$. Their algorithm generalizes to small integer weights, but the underlying approach is incompatible with large weights. Our main result is a dynamic algorithm that maintains $ed^w(X,Y)$ in $\tilde{O}(k^{3-\gamma})$ time per update after $\tilde{O}(nk^\gamma)$-time preprocessing. Here, $\gamma\in [0,1]$ is a real trade-off parameter and $k\ge 1$ is an integer threshold fixed at preprocessing time, with $\infty$ returned whenever $ed^w(X,Y)>k$. We complement our algorithm with conditional lower bounds showing fine-grained optimality of our trade-off for $\gamma \in [0.5,1)$ and justifying our choice to fix $k$.</p></details> | ESA 2025 |

Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks.

Existing mesh tokenization methods always produce token sequences with repeated vertex tokens, wasting the network capability. Therefore, our approach tokenizes mesh vertices by accessing each mesh vertice only once, reduces the token sequence's redundancy by 50\%, and achieves a state-of-the-art compression rate of approximately 22\%. Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology, watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also significantly improved geometric integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main text, 14 pages appendix, 23 figures</p></details> |

Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and scaling to Frontier exascale system.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, in 2025 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), Milan, Italy, 2025</p></details> |

A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[3D Heart Reconstruction from Sparse Pose-agnostic 2D Echocardiographic Slices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02411v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into a personalized 3D heart model. We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of 5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical practice.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version has been reviewed and accepted for presentation at the Future Technologies Conference (FTC) 2025, to be held on 6 & 7 November 2025 in Munich, Germany. 17 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by iccv 2025. code is will be available at https://github.com/rama0126/PwTF-DVD</p></details> |

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture, which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these, Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic Transformer with other deep learning techniques (convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for future research endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journals</p></details> |

Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications.

In this article, we consider a class of generalized coarsened procedures for confounding. At a high level, these procedures can be viewed as performing a clustering of confounding variables, followed by treatment effect and attendant variance estimation using the confounder strata. In addition, we propose two new algorithms for generalized coarsened confounding. While Iacus et al. (2011) developed some statistical properties for one special case in our class of procedures, we instead develop a general asymptotic framework. We provide asymptotic results for the average causal effect estimator as well as providing conditions for consistency. In addition, we provide an asymptotic justification for the variance formulae in Iacus et al. (2011). A bias correction technique is proposed, and we apply the proposed methodology to data from two well-known observational studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2301.00889</p></details> |

While prior MIA research has primarily focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, To appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |

Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gserifi.github.io/HyperGaussians</p></details> |

However, these scaling laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize token efficiency. In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that $2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, with appendix 25 pages</p></details> |

However, its potential for structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference, measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time, incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors), optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements. Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/Joker3993/RLHGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.</p></details> | preprint |

Although existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes.

| **[Think How to Think: Mitigating Overthinking with Autonomous Difficulty Cognition in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02663v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection).</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |

Powerful ethical frameworks exist to minimize these issues, but are often developed for academic or regulatory environments and tend to be comprehensive but overly prescriptive, making them difficult to operationalize within fast-paced, resource-constrained environments. We introduce the Scalable Agile Framework for Execution in AI (SAFE-AI) designed to balance ethical rigor with business priorities by embedding ethical oversight into standard Agile-based product development workflows. The framework emphasizes the early establishment of testable acceptance criteria, fairness metrics, and transparency metrics to manage model uncertainty, while also promoting continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of these metrics across the AI lifecycle. A core component of this framework are responsibility metrics using scenario-based probability analogy mapping designed to enhance transparency and stakeholder trust. This ensures that retraining or tuning activities are subject to lightweight but meaningful ethical review. By focusing on the minimum necessary requirements for responsible development, our framework offers a scalable, business-aligned approach to ethical AI suitable for organizations without dedicated ethics teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, two figures</p></details> |

This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work, we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.</p></details> | 12+8 pages |

It distributes the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose \textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared to baselines.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall.

We extend them with a trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy trade-off.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 Figures |

Conditional generative models depend heavily on expensive annotated training data. Meanwhile, recent frameworks, which leverage pre-trained vision-language models, are limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. In this work, we propose a novel framework named \textit{DeltaEdit} to address these problems. Our key idea is to investigate and identify a space, namely delta image and text space that has well-aligned distribution between CLIP visual feature differences of two images and CLIP textual embedding differences of source and target texts. Based on the CLIP delta space, the DeltaEdit network is designed to map the CLIP visual features differences to the editing directions of StyleGAN at training phase. Then, in inference phase, DeltaEdit predicts the StyleGAN's editing directions from the differences of the CLIP textual features. In this way, DeltaEdit is trained in a text-free manner. Once trained, it can well generalize to various text prompts for zero-shot inference without bells and whistles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/Yueming6568/DeltaEdit</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate how existing approaches perform in this challenging scenario and propose a frequency-temporal recurrent neural network (FTRNN) that effectively bridges this gap. Our FTRNN employs a full-band module to model frequency dependencies within each time frame and a sub-band module that models temporal patterns in each frequency band. Despite being trained on short fixed-length segments of 10 s, our model demonstrates robust separation when processing signals significantly longer than training segments (21-121 s) and preserves speaker association across utterance gaps exceeding those seen during training. Unlike the conventional segment-separation-stitch paradigm, our lightweight approach (0.9 M parameters) performs inference on long audio without segmentation, eliminating segment boundary distortions while simplifying deployment. Experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability of FTRNN for multi-utterance speech separation and speaker association.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by WASPAA 2025</p></details> |

This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are with Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom, China.

| **[Flow Matching on Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00494v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow Matching (FM) is a recent generative modelling technique: we aim to learn how to sample from distribution $\mathfrak{X}_1$ by flowing samples from some distribution $\mathfrak{X}_0$ that is easy to sample from. The key trick is that this flow field can be trained while conditioning on the end point in $\mathfrak{X}_1$: given an end point, simply move along a straight line segment to the end point (Lipman et al. 2022). However, straight line segments are only well-defined on Euclidean space. Consequently, Chen and Lipman (2023) generalised the method to FM on Riemannian manifolds, replacing line segments with geodesics or their spectral approximations. We take an alternative point of view: we generalise to FM on Lie groups by instead substituting exponential curves for line segments. This leads to a simple, intrinsic, and fast implementation for many matrix Lie groups, since the required Lie group operations (products, inverses, exponentials, logarithms) are simply given by the corresponding matrix operations. FM on Lie groups could then be used for generative modelling with data consisting of sets of features (in $\mathbb{R}^n$) and poses (in some Lie group), e.g. the latent codes of Equivariant Neural Fields (Wessels et al. 2025).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 7th International Conference on Geometric Science of Information</p></details> |

We introduce a novel pseudolikelihood-based graphical model framework that reparameterizes the target precision matrix while preserving the sparsity pattern and estimates it by minimizing an $\ell_1$-penalized empirical risk based on a new loss function. The proposed estimator maintains estimation and selection consistency in various metrics under high-dimensional assumptions. The associated optimization problem allows for a provably fast computation algorithm using a novel operator-splitting approach and communication-avoiding distributed matrix multiplication. A high-performance computing implementation of our framework was tested using simulated data with up to one million variables, demonstrating complex dependency structures similar to those found in biological networks. Leveraging this scalability, we estimated a partial correlation network from a dual-omic liver cancer data set. The co-expression network estimated from the ultrahigh-dimensional data demonstrated superior specificity in prioritizing key transcription factors and co-activators by excluding the impact of epigenetic regulation, thereby highlighting the value of computational scalability in multi-omic data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Variational Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02466v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary (short paper) version presented at ComBayNS Workshop at IJCNN'25</p></details> |
| **[Quantum-enhanced causal discovery for a small number of samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05007v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying systems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with nonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any assumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional independence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal relations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures, demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical algorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was validated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and biological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional approaches have shown significant limitations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time. AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL.

A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios, they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess computational requirements at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

Although these models have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation, which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the representations to regress positional information of the patches from high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (Early Access Available) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989734</p></details> |

This problem can be approached from two well-established points of view: deterministically using regularisation methods, or stochastically using the Bayesian framework. Both approaches frequently require the solution of a variational problem. In the paper we elaborate the connection between these approaches by establishing the equivalence between a smoothing Mat{\'e}rn class of covariance operators and Sobolev embedding operator $E_s: H^s \hookrightarrow L^2$. We further discuss the use of a Wavelet-based implementation of the adjoint operator $E_s^*$ which also allows for efficient evaluations for certain Mat{\'e}rn covariance operators, leading to efficient implementations both in terms of computational effort as well as memory requirements. The proposed methods are validated with reconstructions for the photoacoustic problem.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACL 2025 (Oral).

An ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Besides significant changes, slow changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change, a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.</p></details> | ISMIR 2025 |

However, interpreting where LVLMs direct their visual attention remains a significant challenge, yet is essential for understanding model behavior. We introduce GLIMPSE (Gradient-Layer Importance Mapping for Prompted Visual Saliency Explanation), a lightweight, model-agnostic framework that jointly attributes LVLM outputs to the most relevant visual evidence and textual signals that support open-ended generation. GLIMPSE fuses gradient-weighted attention, adaptive layer propagation, and relevance-weighted token aggregation to produce holistic response-level heat maps for interpreting cross-modal reasoning, outperforming prior methods in faithfulness and pushing the state-of-the-art in human-attention alignment. We demonstrate an analytic approach to uncover fine-grained insights into LVLM cross-modal attribution, trace reasoning dynamics, analyze systematic misalignment, diagnose hallucination and bias, and ensure transparency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Explainable Computer Vision, Large Vision-Language Models, AI Interpretability, Explainable AI, Visual Saliency, Attribution Maps, Cross-Modal Attribution, Human Attention Alignment, AI Transparency</p></details> |
| **[MetaCLIP 2: A Worldwide Scaling Recipe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22062v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[StepAL: Step-aware Active Learning for Cataract Surgical Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22059v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets (Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing computer-assisted surgical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[DataSway: Vivifying Metaphoric Visualization with Animation Clip Generation and Coordination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22051v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animating metaphoric visualizations brings data to life, enhancing the comprehension of abstract data encodings and fostering deeper engagement. However, creators face significant challenges in designing these animations, such as crafting motions that align semantically with the metaphors, maintaining faithful data representation during animation, and seamlessly integrating interactivity. We propose a human-AI co-creation workflow that facilitates creating animations for SVG-based metaphoric visualizations. Users can initially derive animation clips for data elements from vision-language models (VLMs) and subsequently coordinate their timelines based on entity order, attribute values, spatial layout, or randomness. Our design decisions were informed by a formative study with experienced designers (N=8). We further developed a prototype, DataSway, and conducted a user study (N=14) to evaluate its creativity support and usability. A gallery with 6 cases demonstrates its capabilities and applications in web-based hypermedia. We conclude with implications for future research on bespoke data visualization animation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DeepSieve: Information Sieving via LLM-as-a-Knowledge-Router](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22050v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity, transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability over conventional RAG approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Weight-Parameterization in Continuous Time Deep Neural Networks for Surrogate Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22045v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms. Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 6 figures, submitted to the MoRE24 special issue of Computational Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15458v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an extraction of Compton Form Factors (CFFs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) experiments conducted at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, utilizing Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). The analysis employs the standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and M\"uller formalism at twist-two, complemented by a fitting procedure designed to minimize model dependence in a manner analogous to conventional local fits. A pseudodata extraction test of the CFFs is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and QDNNs, with a detailed comparative analysis. Results indicate that QDNNs can outperform CDNNs in particular cases, offering enhanced predictive accuracy and precision even with limited model complexity. Motivated by this, we develop a metric to quantify the extent of the quantum advantage based on characteristics of DVCS experimental data. These findings underscore the promising role of QDNNs in advancing future investigations into multidimensional parton distributions and hadronic physics.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 17 figures. v2: major revisions</p></details> |
| **[Supervised Quantum Image Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22039v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Sample Complexity of Branch-length Estimation by Maximum Likelihood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22038v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the branch-length estimation problem on a bifurcating tree: a character evolves along the edges of a binary tree according to a two-state symmetric Markov process, and we seek to recover the edge transition probabilities from repeated observations at the leaves. This problem arises in phylogenetics, and is related to latent tree graphical model inference. In general, the log-likelihood function is non-concave and may admit many critical points. Nevertheless, simple coordinate maximization has been known to perform well in practice, defying the complexity of the likelihood landscape. In this work, we provide the first theoretical guarantee as to why this might be the case. We show that deep inside the Kesten-Stigum reconstruction regime, provided with polynomially many $m$ samples (assuming the tree is balanced), there exists a universal parameter regime (independent of the size of the tree) where the log-likelihood function is strongly concave and smooth with high probability. On this high-probability likelihood landscape event, we show that the standard coordinate maximization algorithm converges exponentially fast to the maximum likelihood estimator, which is within $O(1/\sqrt{m})$ from the true parameter, provided a sufficiently close initial point.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW): Iterative Defense-Attack Training with Reinforcement Learning for Multimodal Model Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22037v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile, existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data. Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while preserving general performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[UserBench: An Interactive Gym Environment for User-Centric Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22034v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague, evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive environment to measure and advance this critical capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 Pa...</summary><p>25 Pages, 17 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Honey Botanical and Geographical Sources using Mineral Profiles and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22032v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, conference paper</p></details> |
| **[Persistent Backdoor Attacks in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13864v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to neural networks, enabling adversaries to manipulate model outputs on specific inputs, often with devastating consequences, especially in critical applications. While backdoor attacks have been studied in various contexts, little attention has been given to their practicality and persistence in continual learning, particularly in understanding how the continual updates to model parameters, as new data distributions are learned and integrated, impact the effectiveness of these attacks over time. To address this gap, we introduce two persistent backdoor attacks-Blind Task Backdoor and Latent Task Backdoor-each leveraging minimal adversarial influence. Our blind task backdoor subtly alters the loss computation without direct control over the training process, while the latent task backdoor influences only a single task's training, with all other tasks trained benignly. We evaluate these attacks under various configurations, demonstrating their efficacy with static, dynamic, physical, and semantic triggers. Our results show that both attacks consistently achieve high success rates across different continual learning algorithms, while effectively evading state-of-the-art defenses, such as SentiNet and I-BAU.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 20 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[NarrLV: Towards a Comprehensive Narrative-Centric Evaluation for Long Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11245v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of foundation video generation technologies, long video generation models have exhibited promising research potential thanks to expanded content creation space. Recent studies reveal that the goal of long video generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to accurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due to the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video generation models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on benchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models. Inspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative unit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative Atom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness. Guided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we construct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing evaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based on the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an effective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and answering framework. (iii) Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations on existing long video generation models and the foundation generation models. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric aligns closely with human judgments. The derived evaluation outcomes reveal the detailed capability boundaries of current video generation models in narrative content expression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://amap-ml.github.io/NarrLV-Website/</p></details> |

The framework employs a leader-follower game model with an adaptive role mechanism to predict human interaction intentions and behaviors. It then utilizes a branch model predictive control (MPC) algorithm to plan the AV trajectory, persuading the human to adopt the desired intention. The proposed framework is demonstrated in an intersection scenario. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the framework for generating persuasive AV trajectories despite uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at MECC 2025 (https://mecc2025.a2c2.org/)</p></details> |
| **[XAI for Point Cloud Data using Perturbations based on Meaningful Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22020v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods, the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating meaningful explanations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A dimension reduction approach to edge weight estimation for use in spatial models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02684v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models for areal data are traditionally defined using the neighborhood structure of the regions on which data are observed. The unweighted adjacency matrix of a graph is commonly used to characterize the relationships between locations, resulting in the implicit assumption that all pairs of neighboring regions interact similarly, an assumption which may not be true in practice. It has been shown that more complex spatial relationships between graph nodes may be represented when edge weights are allowed to vary. Christensen and Hoff (2023) introduced a covariance model for data observed on graphs which is more flexible than traditional alternatives, parameterizing covariance as a function of an unknown edge weights matrix. A potential issue with their approach is that each edge weight is treated as a unique parameter, resulting in increasingly challenging parameter estimation as graph size increases. Within this article we propose a framework for estimating edge weight matrices that reduces their effective dimension via a basis function representation of of the edge weights. We show that this method may be used to enhance the performance and flexibility of covariance models parameterized by such matrices in a series of illustrations, simulations and data examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to JCGS.

| **[Exploring the Stratified Space Structure of an RL Game with the Volume Growth Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22010v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL) game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of "spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently, our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages and 8 figures.

| **[PHAX: A Structured Argumentation Framework for User-Centered Explainable AI in Public Health and Biomedical Sciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22009v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication, and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

It is unclear whether these objectives survive in low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii) a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid (motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 1 table. Code and models are released</p></details> |
| **[See Different, Think Better: Visual Variations Mitigating Hallucinations in LVLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22003v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure. These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning, allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and visual-semantic alignment.

However, for robot manipulation, it is challenging to accurately model the fine-grained robot-object interaction within the visual space using existing methods which overlooks precise alignment between each action and the corresponding frame. In this paper, we present IRASim, a novel world model capable of generating videos with fine-grained robot-object interaction details, conditioned on historical observations and robot action trajectories. We train a diffusion transformer and introduce a novel frame-level action-conditioning module within each transformer block to explicitly model and strengthen the action-frame alignment. Extensive experiments show that: (1) the quality of the videos generated by our method surpasses all the baseline methods and scales effectively with increased model size and computation; (2) policy evaluations using IRASim exhibit a strong correlation with those using the ground-truth simulator, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world policy evaluation; (3) testing-time scaling through model-based planning with IRASim significantly enhances policy performance, as evidenced by an improvement in the IoU metric on the Push-T benchmark from 0.637 to 0.961; (4) IRASim provides flexible action controllability, allowing virtual robotic arms in datasets to be controlled via a keyboard or VR controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>Opens...</summary><p>Opensource, project website: https://gen-irasim.github.io</p></details> |

Staining, also known as watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the (unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small `trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical performance on a variety of computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 pages of appendices, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Misspecifications in structural equation modeling: The choice of latent variables, causal-formative constructs or composites](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21998v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empirical research in many social disciplines involves constructs that are not directly observable, such as behaviors. To model them, constructs must be operationalized using their relations with indicators. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is the primary approach for this purpose. In SEM, three types of constructs are distinguished: latent variables, causal-formative constructs, and composites. To estimate the parameters of the different models, various estimators have been developed. Many Monte Carlo studies have examined the estimation performances of different estimators for the construct types. One aspect evaluated is the consequences of construct misspecification - when the true construct type differs from the modeling choice - on parameter estimates and model fit. For example, parameter bias in models that misspecify latent variables as composites is often attributed to the chosen estimator, although model parameters depend on different estimators, making it impossible to examine the factors individually. This article aims to disentangle the issues of construct misspecification and parameter estimation by a comprehensive Monte Carlo study of all combinations between true and assumed construct types. To focus on misspecification, we used the same estimator for all models, namely the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. To generalize beyond ML, we replicated the simulation using another estimator. We aim to examine the role of construct misspecification, not estimator choice, on the estimation performance and show that misspecification leads indeed to biased path coefficient estimates. Further, we evaluate whether fit measures can distinguish models with correct from those with misspecified constructs. We find that none of the criteria considered is suited for this. These findings stress the importance of thoughtful construct specification and the need for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, supplementary material and code available online</p></details> |

A lightweight student model is trained using two KD strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50 and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we focus on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM, ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge points to enhance the model's understanding of the fundamental principles and logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical reasoning. Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that ChemDFM-R achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable, rationale-driven outputs. Further case studies illustrate how explicit reasoning chains significantly improve the reliability, transparency, and practical utility of the model in real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios.</p></details> | 13 figures, 4 tables |

Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for previously attacked unlearned concepts.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[Higher-Order Kuramoto Oscillator Network for Dense Associative Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21984v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling, inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in oscillator systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

LLMs are pre-trained on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads. This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>D.J. ...</summary><p>D.J. and A.N. contributed equally, 41 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

We demonstrate that sophisticated mathematical reasoning can emerge with only a few examples. Specifically, through simple supervised fine-tuning, our model, LIMO, achieves 63.3\% accuracy on AIME24 and 95.6\% on MATH500, surpassing previous fine-tuned models (6.5\% on AIME24, 59.2\% on MATH500) while using only 1\% of the training data required by prior approaches. Furthermore, LIMO exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, achieving a 45.8\% absolute improvement across diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data. Synthesizing these findings, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning can emerge through minimal but strategically designed demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis suggests that the threshold for eliciting complex reasoning is not dictated by task complexity but rather by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's pre-trained knowledge base and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples in serving as "cognitive templates" that guide reasoning.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for adaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge sharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the ability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these essential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated collective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable effective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and systematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how does the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce redundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve reasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the interplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the collective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an empirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration of these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous agent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science and AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like collaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and critical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle complex, real-world challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CogSci 2025</p></details> |

As a result, the deliberative system is updated from a PDDL-based planner system to a natural language planning system. This proposal is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, measuring the impact of incorporating the LLMs in the cognitive architecture.

Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise. These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for practical applications.

Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for image storage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of "spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently, our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages and 8 figures.

However, for robot manipulation, it is challenging to accurately model the fine-grained robot-object interaction within the visual space using existing methods which overlooks precise alignment between each action and the corresponding frame. In this paper, we present IRASim, a novel world model capable of generating videos with fine-grained robot-object interaction details, conditioned on historical observations and robot action trajectories. We train a diffusion transformer and introduce a novel frame-level action-conditioning module within each transformer block to explicitly model and strengthen the action-frame alignment. Extensive experiments show that: (1) the quality of the videos generated by our method surpasses all the baseline methods and scales effectively with increased model size and computation; (2) policy evaluations using IRASim exhibit a strong correlation with those using the ground-truth simulator, highlighting its potential to accelerate real-world policy evaluation; (3) testing-time scaling through model-based planning with IRASim significantly enhances policy performance, as evidenced by an improvement in the IoU metric on the Push-T benchmark from 0.637 to 0.961; (4) IRASim provides flexible action controllability, allowing virtual robotic arms in datasets to be controlled via a keyboard or VR controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>Opens...</summary><p>Opensource, project website: https://gen-irasim.github.io</p></details> |

While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories, this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\% accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.

Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance.

| **[Reducing Data Requirements for Sequence-Property Prediction in Copolymer Compatibilizers via Deep Neural Network Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21902v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared, embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100 natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images. Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external world.</p></details> | 51 pages, 15 figures |

Existing methods typically formulate it as an image-to-sequence problem, employing conventional Transformer architectures. However, these methods lack dedicated design and consequently result in limited performance. As such, this paper describes a new Transformer design, called {TSOM}, by exploring three perspectives: Texture, Shape, and Order of Manipulations. Our method features four major improvements: \ding{182} we describe a new texture-aware branch that effectively captures subtle manipulation traces with a Diversiform Pixel Difference Attention module. \ding{183} Then we introduce a Multi-source Cross-attention module to seek deep correlations among spatial and sequential features, enabling effective modeling of complex manipulation traces. \ding{184} To further enhance the cross-attention, we describe a Shape-guided Gaussian mapping strategy, providing initial priors of the manipulation shape. \ding{185} Finally, observing that the subsequent manipulation in a sequence may influence traces left in the preceding one, we intriguingly invert the prediction order from forward to backward, leading to notable gains as expected. Building upon TSOM, we introduce an extended method, {TSOM++}, which additionally explores Relation of manipulations: \ding{186} we propose a new sequential contrastive learning scheme to capture relationships between various manipulation types in sequence, further enhancing the detection of manipulation traces. We conduct extensive experiments in comparison with several state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the superiority of our method.

Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear, constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix. This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19847v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability. To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset, KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization setting with unseen ID categories.

Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic, balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ESSLLI 2025 Student Session</p></details> |

However, their computational difficulty cannot easily be characterized using traditional complexity theory, which focuses on tasks with classical inputs and outputs. To study the complexity of such state transformation tasks, we introduce a framework for unitary synthesis problems, including notions of reductions and unitary complexity classes. We use this framework to study the complexity of transforming one entangled state into another via local operations. We formalize this as the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, an algorithmic version of Uhlmann's theorem. Then, we prove structural results relating the complexity of the Uhlmann Transformation Problem, polynomial space quantum computation, and zero knowledge protocols. The Uhlmann Transformation Problem allows us to characterize the complexity of a variety of tasks in quantum information processing, including decoding noisy quantum channels, breaking falsifiable quantum cryptographic assumptions, implementing optimal prover strategies in quantum interactive proofs, and decoding the Hawking radiation of black holes. Our framework for unitary complexity thus provides new avenues for studying the computational complexity of many natural quantum information processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>96 pa...</summary><p>96 pages.

While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 18 pages,9 figuers |

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted with an A-decision to Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

Gradient compression, particularly quantization, is a promising approach to mitigate this bottleneck. However, existing quantization schemes are often incompatible with Allreduce, the dominant communication primitive in distributed deep learning, and many prior solutions rely on heuristics without theoretical guarantees. We introduce Global-QSGD, an Allreduce-compatible gradient quantization method that leverages global norm scaling to reduce communication overhead while preserving accuracy. Global-QSGD is backed by rigorous theoretical analysis, extending standard unbiased compressor frameworks to establish formal convergence guarantees. Additionally, we develop a performance model to evaluate its impact across different hardware configurations. Extensive experiments on NVLink, PCIe, and large-scale cloud environments show that Global-QSGD accelerates distributed training by up to 3.51% over baseline quantization methods, making it a practical and efficient solution for large-scale deep learning workloads.</p></details> | ECAI'25 |

This work focuses on the domain of human motion, more precisely karate movement patterns. To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first success at manipulating attributes of human motion data. One of the key requirements for achieving attribute manipulation on human motion is a suitable pose representation. Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based pose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and the motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the original anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a transformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion probabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show that the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically meaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes, by discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space and moving the embedding along said direction. All code and data is made publicly available.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

In general, design recommendations are related to this, supporting the design of applications positively and meeting stakeholder needs. However, current research lacks context-specific AR design recommendations. This study addresses this gap by identifying and analyzing practical AR design recommendations relevant to the evaluation phase of the User-Centered Design (UCD) process. We rely on an existing dataset of Mixed Reality (MR) design recommendations. We applied a multi-method approach by (1) extending the dataset with AR-specific recommendations published since 2020, (2) classifying the identified recommendations using a NLP classification approach based on a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model, (3) summarizing the content of all topics, and (4) evaluating their relevance concerning AR in Corporate Training (CT) both based on a qualitative Round Robin approach with five experts. As a result, an updated dataset of 597 practitioner design recommendations, classified into 84 topics, is provided with new insights into their applicability in the context of AR in CT. Based on this, 32 topics with a total of 284 statements were evaluated as relevant for AR in CT. This research directly contributes to the authors' work for extending their AR-specific User Experience (UX) measurement approach, supporting AR authors in targeting the improvement of AR applications for CT scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 1 table, 1 figure</p></details> |

Although these technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation, their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip development cycle -- remains at an exploratory stage. This paper proposes an innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents, including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code implementation.

These conventional methods typically suffer from reliance on large training datasets or lack a formalized language for precise edits. Utilizing CGA as a robust formal language, our system, Shenlong, precisely models spatial transformations necessary for accurate object repositioning. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, Shenlong translates natural language instructions into CGA operations which are then applied to the scene, facilitating exact spatial transformations within 3D scenes without the need for specialized pre-training. Implemented in a realistic simulation environment, Shenlong ensures compatibility with existing graphics pipelines. To accurately assess the impact of CGA, we benchmark against robust Euclidean Space baselines, evaluating both latency and accuracy. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that Shenlong significantly reduces LLM response times by 16% and boosts success rates by 9.6% on average compared to the traditional methods. Notably, Shenlong achieves a 100% perfect success rate in common practical queries, a benchmark where other systems fall short. These advancements underscore Shenlong's potential to democratize 3D scene editing, enhancing accessibility and fostering innovation across sectors such as education, digital entertainment, and virtual reality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is so large -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may elicit harmful behaviors. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to improve robustness, however, they empirically struggle to fix failure modes that differ from the attacks used during training. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without leveraging knowledge of what they are or using inputs that elicit them. LAT makes use of the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. Here, we use it to defend against failure modes without examples that elicit them. Specifically, we use LAT to remove backdoors and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness to novel attacks and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>See a...</summary><p>See also followup work at arXiv:2407.15549</p></details> |

To bridge the gap, we propose MAYA, an encoder-decoder transformer-based framework. In the encoder, we design a Multi-Branch of Attention (MBA) that constructs multiple parallel attention branches and averages the features at each branch, effectively fusing heterogeneous features while limiting parameter growth. Additionally, we employ collaborative learning with a dynamic consistency weight constraint to produce more robust representations. In the decoder stage, cross-attention is utilized to seamlessly integrate tabular data with corresponding label features. This dual-attention mechanism effectively captures both intra-instance and inter-instance interactions. We evaluate the proposed method on a wide range of datasets and compare it with other state-of-the-art transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance among transformer-based methods in both tabular classification and regression tasks.</p></details> | 19 pages, 3 figures |

We show that generalized de Bruijn words are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles in the generalized de Bruijn graphs introduced in the early '80s in the context of network design. When the size of the alphabet is a prime $p$, we define invertible necklaces as those whose BWT-matrix is non-singular. We show that invertible necklaces of length $n$ correspond to normal bases of the finite field $F_{p^n}$, and that they form an Abelian group isomorphic to the Reutenauer group $RG_p^n$. Using known results in abstract algebra, we can make a bridge between generalized de Bruijn words and invertible necklaces. In particular, we highlight a correspondence between binary de Bruijn words of order $d+1$, binary necklaces of length $2^{d}$ having an odd number of $1$'s, invertible BWT matrices of size $2^{d}\times 2^{d}$, and normal bases of the finite field $F_{2^{2^{d}}}$.</p></details> | Submitted |

One prominent example is quantum physics, where computers can discover experiments for the generation of specific quantum states, but it is unclear how finding general design concepts can be automated. Here, we address this challenge by training a transformer-based language model to create human-readable Python code, which solves an entire class of problems in a single pass. This strategy, which we call meta-design, enables scientists to gain a deeper understanding and extrapolate to larger experiments without additional optimization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we uncover previously unknown experimental generalizations of important quantum states, e.g. from condensed matter physics. The underlying methodology of meta-design can naturally be extended to fields such as materials science or engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+23 ...</summary><p>8+23 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer, resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps, a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 45 references</p></details> |

However, 3DGS still faces major efficiency challenges when faced with high frame rate requirements and resource-constrained edge deployment. To enable efficient 3DGS, in this paper, we propose LS-Gaussian, an algorithm/hardware co-design framework for lightweight streaming 3D rendering. LS-Gaussian is motivated by the core observation that 3DGS suffers from substantial computation redundancy and stalls. On one hand, in practical scenarios, high-frame-rate 3DGS is often applied in settings where a camera observes and renders the same scene continuously but from slightly different viewpoints. Therefore, instead of rendering each frame separately, LS-Gaussian proposes a viewpoint transformation algorithm that leverages inter-frame continuity for efficient sparse rendering. On the other hand, as different tiles within an image are rendered in parallel but have imbalanced workloads, frequent hardware stalls also slow down the rendering process. LS-Gaussian predicts the workload for each tile based on viewpoint transformation to enable more balanced parallel computation and co-designs a customized 3DGS accelerator to support the workload-aware mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that LS-Gaussian achieves 5.41x speedup over the edge GPU baseline on average and up to 17.3x speedup with the customized accelerator, while incurring only minimal visual quality degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> |

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/HeadHunter/</p></details> |

The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising. First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest (confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing archaeological evidence induced by anthropization</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 Figures |

This problem arises in phylogenetics, and is related to latent tree graphical model inference. In general, the log-likelihood function is non-concave and may admit many critical points. Nevertheless, simple coordinate maximization has been known to perform well in practice, defying the complexity of the likelihood landscape. In this work, we provide the first theoretical guarantee as to why this might be the case. We show that deep inside the Kesten-Stigum reconstruction regime, provided with polynomially many $m$ samples (assuming the tree is balanced), there exists a universal parameter regime (independent of the size of the tree) where the log-likelihood function is strongly concave and smooth with high probability. On this high-probability likelihood landscape event, we show that the standard coordinate maximization algorithm converges exponentially fast to the maximum likelihood estimator, which is within $O(1/\sqrt{m})$ from the true parameter, provided a sufficiently close initial point.</p></details> | 22 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Towards Cognitive Synergy in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems: Integrating Theory of Mind and Critical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21969v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the field of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has gained popularity as researchers are trying to develop artificial intelligence capable of efficient collective reasoning. Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in isolated tasks, yet struggle with higher-order cognition required for adaptive collaboration. Human teams achieve synergy not only through knowledge sharing, but also through recursive reasoning, structured critique, and the ability to infer others' mental states. Current artificial systems lack these essential mechanisms, limiting their ability to engage in sophisticated collective reasoning. This work explores cognitive processes that enable effective collaboration, focusing on adaptive theory of mind (ToM) and systematic critical evaluation. We investigate three key questions. First, how does the ability to model others' perspectives enhance coordination and reduce redundant reasoning? Second, to what extent does structured critique improve reasoning quality by identifying logical gaps and mitigating biases? Third, the interplay of these mechanisms can lead to emergent cognitive synergy, where the collective intelligence of the system exceeds the sum of its parts. Through an empirical case study on complex decision making, we show that the integration of these cognitive mechanisms leads to more coherent, adaptive, and rigorous agent interactions. This article contributes to the field of cognitive science and AI research by presenting a structured framework that emulates human-like collaborative reasoning MAS. It highlights the significance of dynamic ToM and critical evaluation in advancing multi-agent systems' ability to tackle complex, real-world challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CogSci 2025</p></details> |

However, defining domains and problems has proven difficult and prone to errors. Moreover, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools to process natural language for different tasks. In this paper, we propose the use of LLMs to tackle these problems. This way, this paper proposes the integration of LLMs in the ROS 2-integrated cognitive architecture MERLIN2 for autonomous robots. Specifically, we present the design, development and deployment of how to leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs inside the deliberative processes of MERLIN2. As a result, the deliberative system is updated from a PDDL-based planner system to a natural language planning system. This proposal is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, measuring the impact of incorporating the LLMs in the cognitive architecture. Results show that a classical approach achieves better performance but the proposed solution provides an enhanced interaction through natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to ROBOT 2025 (8th Iberian Robotics Conference)</p></details> |

While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.</p></details> | <details><summary>For o...</summary><p>For ongoing updates and to track the latest advances in this promising area, we maintain a public repository: https://github.com/cokeshao/Awesome-Multimodal-Token-Compression</p></details> |

Experiments conducted on popular LLMs (LLaMA2 7B, LLaMA3.1 8B, and Mistral 7B) demonstrate that SmoothRot consistently reduces the performance gap between quantized and FP16 models by approximately 10-30\% across language generation and zero-shot reasoning tasks, without introducing additional inference latency.

| **[Reducing Data Requirements for Sequence-Property Prediction in Copolymer Compatibilizers via Deep Neural Network Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21902v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast, enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning capabilities of RBNs. We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic models. To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new publicly available benchmark datasets. This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications and improved performance across diverse tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR); under revision. 29 pages, 6 figures.

The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML Workshop: Efficient Systems for Foundation Models</p></details> |

However, existing methods struggle with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and 4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution for open-domain 3D content creation.

While prior work on goal recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain, we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.</p></details> | Accepted by KR2025 |

Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes.

This paper introduces GSON, a novel group-based social navigation framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance robots' social perception capabilities. Our approach uses visual prompting to enable zero-shot extraction of social relationships among pedestrians and integrates these results with robust pedestrian detection and tracking pipelines to overcome the inherent inference speed limitations of LMMs. The planning system incorporates a mid-level planner that sits between global path planning and local motion planning, effectively preserving both global context and reactive responsiveness while avoiding disruption of the predicted social group. We validate GSON through extensive real-world mobile robot navigation experiments involving complex social scenarios such as queuing, conversations, and photo sessions. Comparative results show that our system significantly outperforms existing navigation approaches in minimizing social perturbations while maintaining comparable performance on traditional navigation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

To mitigate this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29 subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios: memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data. The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments, providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167 open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy, underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model performance and propose strategies for enhancement.

While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 18 pages,9 figuers |

This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta, and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific, prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating further temporal evolution.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing quantization schemes are often incompatible with Allreduce, the dominant communication primitive in distributed deep learning, and many prior solutions rely on heuristics without theoretical guarantees. We introduce Global-QSGD, an Allreduce-compatible gradient quantization method that leverages global norm scaling to reduce communication overhead while preserving accuracy. Global-QSGD is backed by rigorous theoretical analysis, extending standard unbiased compressor frameworks to establish formal convergence guarantees. Additionally, we develop a performance model to evaluate its impact across different hardware configurations. Extensive experiments on NVLink, PCIe, and large-scale cloud environments show that Global-QSGD accelerates distributed training by up to 3.51% over baseline quantization methods, making it a practical and efficient solution for large-scale deep learning workloads.</p></details> | ECAI'25 |
| **[RRTO: A High-Performance Transparent Offloading System for Model Inference in Mobile Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21739v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying Machine Learning (ML) applications on resource-constrained mobile devices remains challenging due to limited computational resources and poor platform compatibility. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers offloading-based inference paradigm using GPU servers, existing approaches are divided into non-transparent and transparent methods, with the latter necessitating modifications to the source code. Non-transparent offloading achieves high performance but requires intrusive code modification, limiting compatibility with diverse applications. Transparent offloading, in contrast, offers wide compatibility but introduces significant transmission delays due to per-operator remote procedure calls (RPCs). To overcome this limitation, we propose RRTO, the first high-performance transparent offloading system tailored for MEC inference. RRTO introduces a record/replay mechanism that leverages the static operator sequence in ML models to eliminate repetitive RPCs. To reliably identify this sequence, RRTO integrates a novel Operator Sequence Search algorithm that detects repeated patterns, filters initialization noise, and accelerates matching via a two-level strategy. Evaluation demonstrates that RRTO achieves substantial reductions of up to 98% in both per-inference latency and energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art transparent methods and yields results comparable to non-transparent approaches, all without necessitating any source code modification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures,</p></details> |

(2016) suggest a fast algorithm for computing volume potentials, beneficial to fields with problems requiring the solution of the free-space Poisson's equation, such as beam and plasma physics. Currently, the standard is the algorithm of Hockney and Eastwood (1988), with second order in convergence at best. The algorithm proposed by Vico et al. converges spectrally for sufficiently smooth functions i.e. faster than any fixed order in the number of grid points. We implement a performance portable version of the traditional Hockney-Eastwood and the novel Vico-Greengard Poisson solver as part of the IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer) library. For sufficiently smooth source functions, the Vico-Greengard algorithm achieves higher accuracy than the Hockney-Eastwood method with the same grid size, reducing the computational demands of high resolution simulations since one could use coarser grids to achieve them. Additionally, we propose an improvement to the Vico-Greengard method which further reduces its memory footprint. This is important for GPUs, which have limited memory, and should be taken into account when selecting numerical algorithms for performance portable codes. Finally, we showcase performance through GPU and CPU scaling studies on the Perlmutter (NERSC) supercomputer, with efficiencies staying above 50% in the strong scaling case. To showcase portability, we also run the scaling studies on the Alps supercomputer at CSCS, Switzerland and the GPU partition of the Lumi supercomputer at CSC, Finland.</p></details> | 29 pages, 19 figures |
| **[UncertainSAM: Fast and Efficient Uncertainty Quantification of the Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05049v4)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has paved the way for numerous semantic segmentation applications. For several tasks, quantifying the uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k, DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines, or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML'25 |

We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745). Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged 0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little focus on clinical utility. Multimodal WSI-omics survival prediction is a fast-growing field with promising results but needs improved methodological rigor, broader datasets, and clinical evaluation.

This work is typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25 fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area. Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025's Joint Workshop on Marine Vision (ICCVW, CVAUI&AAMVEM).

| **[Probing then Editing Response Personality of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10227v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities to generate responses that simulate consistent personality traits. Despite the major attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based evaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded within LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in simulating personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly simulate personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency.

Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open physical-world embodied intelligence.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, these models usually rely on extensive visual tokens from visual encoders, leading to high computational demands, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments and for long-context tasks. In this work, we propose a training-free adaptive inference method for multi-modal LLMs that can accommodate a broad range of efficiency requirements with a minimum performance drop. Our method consists of a) iterative token merging based on embedding similarity before LLMs, and b) progressive token pruning within LLM layers based on multi-modal importance. With a minimalist design, our method can be applied to both video and image LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse video and image benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computation load (e.g., a $\textbf{7-fold}$ reduction in FLOPs) while preserving the performance of video and image LLMs. Further, at a similar computational cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in long video understanding (e.g., $\textbf{+4.6}$ on MLVU). Additionally, our in-depth analysis provides insights into token redundancy and LLM layer behaviors, offering guidance for future research in designing efficient multi-modal LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/AIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer, resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps, a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, 45 references</p></details> |

Although many studies have successfully adapted pretrained language models (LMs) for sign language translation (sign-to-text), the reverse task-sign language generation (text-to-sign)-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a multilingual sign language model, Signs as Tokens (SOKE), which can generate 3D sign avatars autoregressively from text inputs using a pretrained LM. To align sign language with the LM, we leverage a decoupled tokenizer that discretizes continuous signs into token sequences representing various body parts. During decoding, unlike existing approaches that flatten all part-wise tokens into a single sequence and predict one token at a time, we propose a multi-head decoding method capable of predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach improves inference efficiency while maintaining effective information fusion across different body parts. To further ease the generation process, we propose a retrieval-enhanced SLG approach, which incorporates external sign dictionaries to provide accurate word-level signs as auxiliary conditions, significantly improving the precision of generated signs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SOKE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fast Globally Optimal and Geometrically Consistent 3D Shape Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06385v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric consistency, i.e. the preservation of neighbourhoods, is a natural and strong prior in 3D shape matching. Geometrically consistent matchings are crucial for many downstream applications, such as texture transfer or statistical shape modelling. Yet, in practice, geometric consistency is often overlooked, or only achieved under severely limiting assumptions (e.g. a good initialisation). In this work, we propose a novel formalism for computing globally optimal and geometrically consistent matchings between 3D shapes which is scalable in practice. Our key idea is to represent the surface of the source shape as a collection of cyclic paths, which are then consistently matched to the target shape. Mathematically, we construct a hyper product graph (between source and target shape), and then cast 3D shape matching as a minimum-cost circulation flow problem in this hyper graph, which yields global geometrically consistent matchings between both shapes. We empirically show that our formalism is efficiently solvable and that it leads to high-quality results.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main paper, 9 pages supplementary</p></details> |

However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting}, a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model. Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU, highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

Although recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while substantially reducing the measurement burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, under review</p></details> |

In immersive scenes, people naturally scan their environment to grasp its overall structure while examining fine details of objects that capture their attention. However, current NeRF frameworks primarily focus on modeling either high-frequency local views or the broad structure of scenes with low-frequency information, which is limited to balancing both. We introduce FA-NeRF, a novel frequency-aware framework for view synthesis that simultaneously captures the overall scene structure and high-definition details within a single NeRF model. To achieve this, we propose a 3D frequency quantification method that analyzes the scene's frequency distribution, enabling frequency-aware rendering. Our framework incorporates a frequency grid for fast convergence and querying, a frequency-aware feature re-weighting strategy to balance features across different frequency contents. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in modeling entire scenes while preserving fine details.

Debugging remains unsolved despite these advances. While Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1 achieve >70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they perform <15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model built specifically for debugging. Chronos combines Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines using multi-hop traversal (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on 15M+ sessions, and a 7-layer architecture for iterative fix-test-refine loops. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy, compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude and GPT-4.1 respectively. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iteration count by 65%. It resolves complex multi-file bugs involving cross-repository context and temporal reasoning. Key limitations include 23.4% success on hardware-dependent issues and 41.2% on dynamic language errors. Theoretical analysis shows O(k log d) retrieval complexity with convergence guarantees. In a human evaluation (N=50), 89% of participants preferred Chronos over baseline models.

One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose RAIF, a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Evaluation on OOD constraints also confirms the generalizability of our RAIF. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

Existing methods typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set 3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images, DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on image-based and cross-dataset setups.

| **[The pitfalls of next-token prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06963v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can a mere next-token predictor faithfully model human intelligence? We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective. As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using _teacherless_ training, a simple modification using dummy tokens that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope this finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm.

Emerging large language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning, offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate, automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base, automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[VLM-CPL: Consensus Pseudo Labels from Vision-Language Models for Annotation-Free Pathological Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15836v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of pathological images is the basis for automatic cancer diagnosis. Despite that deep learning methods have achieved remarkable performance, they heavily rely on labeled data, demanding extensive human annotation efforts. In this study, we present a novel human annotation-free method by leveraging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Without human annotation, pseudo-labels of the training set are obtained by utilizing the zero-shot inference capabilities of VLM, which may contain a lot of noise due to the domain gap between the pre-training and target datasets. To address this issue, we introduce VLM-CPL, a novel approach that contains two noisy label filtering techniques with a semi-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, we first obtain prompt-based pseudo-labels with uncertainty estimation by zero-shot inference with the VLM using multiple augmented views of an input. Then, by leveraging the feature representation ability of VLM, we obtain feature-based pseudo-labels via sample clustering in the feature space. Prompt-feature consensus is introduced to select reliable samples based on the consensus between the two types of pseudo-labels. We further propose High-confidence Cross Supervision by to learn from samples with reliable pseudo-labels and the remaining unlabeled samples. Additionally, we present an innovative open-set prompting strategy that filters irrelevant patches from whole slides to enhance the quality of selected patches. Experimental results on five public pathological image datasets for patch-level and slide-level classification showed that our method substantially outperformed zero-shot classification by VLMs, and was superior to existing noisy label learning methods.

| **[Soft Injection of Task Embeddings Outperforms Prompt-Based In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20906v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters. This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.2%-14.3% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones -- underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the activation space.</p></details> | Preprint |

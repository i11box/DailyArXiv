| **[ConsistEdit: Highly Consistent and Precise Training-free Visual Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17803v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing. Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 |
| **[Dynamic Dyck and Tree Edit Distance: Decompositions and Reductions to String Edit Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17799v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first dynamic algorithms for Dyck and tree edit distances with subpolynomial update times. Dyck edit distance measures how far a parenthesis string is from a well-parenthesized expression, while tree edit distance quantifies the minimum number of node insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one rooted, ordered, labeled tree into another. Despite extensive study, no prior work has addressed efficient dynamic algorithms for these problems, which naturally arise in evolving structured data such as LaTeX documents, JSON or XML files, and RNA secondary structures. Our main contribution is a set of reductions and decompositions that transform Dyck and tree edit distance instances into efficiently maintainable string edit distance instances, which can be approximated within a $n^{o(1)}$ factor in $n^{o(1)}$ update time. For Dyck edit distance, our reduction incurs only polylogarithmic overheads in approximation and update time, yielding an $n^{o(1)}$-approximation with $n^{o(1)}$ updates. For tree edit distance, we introduce a new static reduction that improves the best-known approximation ratio from $n^{3/4}$ to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ and removes the restriction to constant-degree trees. Extending this reduction dynamically achieves $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ approximation with $n^{o(1)}$ update time. A key component is a dynamic maintenance algorithm for history-independent heavy-light decompositions, of independent interest. We also provide a novel static and dynamic decomposition achieving an $O(k \log n)$-approximation when the tree edit distance is at most $k$. Combined with the trivial bound $k \le n$, this yields a dynamic deterministic $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$-approximation. In the static setting, our algorithm runs in near-linear time; dynamically, it requires only polylogarithmic updates, improving on prior linear-time static $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of a FOCS 2025 paper</p></details> |

Our proposed approach imports tools from probability theory, such as concentration inequalities for random matrices with independent entries. It yields error bounds for common approximations of the AC power flow equations under parameter uncertainty, including the DC and LinDistFlow approximations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Executable Knowledge Graphs for Replicating AI Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17795v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at https://github.com/zjunlp/xKG.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Foundational Automatic Evaluators: Scaling Multi-Task Generative Evaluator Training for Reasoning-Centric Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17793v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Denoising the Future: Top-p Distributions for Moving Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07578v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states, i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECSQARU 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning: A Linear Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02058v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Botany-Bot: Digital Twin Monitoring of Occluded and Underleaf Plant Structures with Gaussian Splats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17783v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial plant phenotyping systems using fixed cameras cannot perceive many plant details due to leaf occlusion. In this paper, we present Botany-Bot, a system for building detailed "annotated digital twins" of living plants using two stereo cameras, a digital turntable inside a lightbox, an industrial robot arm, and 3D segmentated Gaussian Splat models. We also present robot algorithms for manipulating leaves to take high-resolution indexable images of occluded details such as stem buds and the underside/topside of leaves. Results from experiments suggest that Botany-Bot can segment leaves with 90.8% accuracy, detect leaves with 86.2% accuracy, lift/push leaves with 77.9% accuracy, and take detailed overside/underside images with 77.3% accuracy.

| **[Score-based deterministic density sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18130v3)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deterministic sampling framework using Score-Based Transport Modeling for sampling an unnormalized target density $\pi$ given only its score $\nabla \log \pi$. Our method approximates the Wasserstein gradient flow on $\mathrm{KL}(f_t\|\pi)$ by learning the time-varying score $\nabla \log f_t$ on the fly using score matching. While having the same marginal distribution as Langevin dynamics, our method produces smooth deterministic trajectories, resulting in monotone noise-free convergence. We prove that our method dissipates relative entropy at the same rate as the exact gradient flow, provided sufficient training. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings: our method converges at the optimal rate, has smooth trajectories, and is often more sample efficient than its stochastic counterpart. Experiments on high-dimensional image data show that our method produces high-quality generations in as few as 15 steps and exhibits natural exploratory behavior. The memory and runtime scale linearly in the sample size.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 tables, 11 figures.

| **[Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17776v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale -- enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.</p></details> | 43 pages,15 figures |
| **[Towards Explainable Skin Cancer Classification: A Dual-Network Attention Model with Lesion Segmentation and Clinical Metadata Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17773v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Seeing but Not Believing: Probing the Disconnect Between Visual Attention and Answer Correctness in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17771v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term ``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic understanding and reliability of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Communication and Control Design for Distributed Frequency Regulation with Black-box Inverters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17769v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources into the power grid, with often only black-box models available, challenges long-standing frequency control methods. Most recent works take a decentralized approach without online device coordination via communication. This paper considers both dynamic behavior and communication within secondary frequency control on an intermediate timescale. We develop a distributed data-driven approach that utilizes peer-to-peer communication between inverters to avoid the need for a central control center. To enable a trade off between communication network requirements and control performance, we present a framework to guide communication topology design for secondary frequency regulation. Following design of the inter-agent information exchange scheme, we design a controller that is structured according to the communication topology with a closed-loop stability guarantee. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the framework and illustrate the trade-off between communication requirements and control performance that is enabled by our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to PSCC 2026</p></details> |

It provides over 100 data generators and verifiers spanning multiple domains including algebra, arithmetic, computation, cognition, geometry, graph theory, logic, and various common games. Its key innovation is the ability to generate virtually infinite training data with adjustable complexity, unlike most previous reasoning datasets, which are typically fixed. This procedural generation approach allows for continuous evaluation across varying difficulty levels.

We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/xiechun298/SV-DRR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Minimum Threat Exposure using Physics-Informed Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17762v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the two-point boundary value problem (BVP) arising from the necessary conditions postulated by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for optimal control. Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Indian Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[VERA-V: Variational Inference Framework for Jailbreaking Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17759v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend large language models with visual reasoning, but their multimodal design also introduces new, underexplored vulnerabilities. Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 Figures, |

However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Environmental Modelling & Software</p></details> |

We Will Find Better Configurations More Quickly Than Retraining From Scratch!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17748v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tuning database management systems (DBMSs) is challenging due to trillions of possible configurations and evolving workloads. Recent advances in tuning have led to breakthroughs in optimizing over the possible configurations. However, due to their design and inability to leverage query-level historical insights, existing automated tuners struggle to adapt and re-optimize the DBMS when the environment changes (e.g., workload drift, schema transfer). This paper presents the Booster framework that assists existing tuners in adapting to environment changes (e.g., drift, cross-schema transfer). Booster structures historical artifacts into query-configuration contexts, prompts large language models (LLMs) to suggest configurations for each query based on relevant contexts, and then composes the query-level suggestions into a holistic configuration with beam search. With multiple OLAP workloads, we evaluate Booster's ability to assist different state-of-the-art tuners (e.g., cost-/machine learning-/LLM-based) in adapting to environment changes. By composing recommendations derived from query-level insights, Booster assists tuners in discovering configurations that are up to 74% better and in up to 4.7x less time than the alternative approach of continuing to tune from historical configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGMOD2026</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a multi-threading kernel that enables neuromorphic applications running at the edge, meaning they process sensory input directly and without any up-link to or dependency on a cloud service. The kernel shows speed-up gains over single thread processing by a factor of four on moderately sized SNNs and 1.7X on a Synfire network. Furthermore, it load-balances all cores available on multi-core processors, such as ARM, which run today's mobile devices and is up to 70% more energy efficient compared to statical core assignment. The present work can enable the development of edge applications that have low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), and can prototype the integration of neuromorphic chips.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ISCAS 2026</p></details> |

While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness, increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes, with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation while remaining lightweight.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[A Synthetic Data-Driven Radiology Foundation Model for Pan-tumor Clinical Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06171v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-assisted imaging made substantial advances in tumor diagnosis and management. However, a major barrier to developing robust oncology foundation models is the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets, which are limited by privacy restrictions and the high cost of manual labeling. To address this gap, we present PASTA, a pan-tumor radiology foundation model built on PASTA-Gen, a synthetic data framework that generated 30,000 3D CT scans with pixel-level lesion masks and structured reports of tumors across ten organ systems. Leveraging this resource, PASTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 45 of 46 oncology tasks, including non-contrast CT tumor screening, lesion segmentation, structured reporting, tumor staging, survival prediction, and MRI-modality transfer. To assess clinical applicability, we developed PASTA-AID, a clinical decision support system, and ran a retrospective simulated clinical trial across two scenarios. For pan-tumor screening on plain CT with fixed reading time, PASTA-AID increased radiologists' throughput by 11.1-25.1% and improved sensitivity by 17.0-31.4% and precision by 10.5-24.9%; additionally, in a diagnosis-aid workflow, it reduced segmentation time by up to 78.2% and reporting time by up to 36.5%. Beyond gains in accuracy and efficiency, PASTA-AID narrowed the expertise gap, enabling less-experienced radiologists to approach expert-level performance. Together, this work establishes an end-to-end, synthetic data-driven pipeline spanning data generation, model development, and clinical validation, thereby demonstrating substantial potential for pan-tumor research and clinical translation.</p></details> | 63 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LeapFactual: Reliable Visual Counterfactual Explanation Using Conditional Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14623v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster presentation at NeurIPS 2025.

However, such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages. Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset, and leaderboard are publicly available at https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

| **[Enabling Fine-Grained Operating Points for Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17727v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.</p></details> | 35 pages |

This study explores students' perceptions of both tools, emphasizing usability, efficiency, and their integration into academic workflows. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 109 students from diverse disciplines and conducted in-depth interviews with 12 participants. Quantitative analyses, including ANOVA and chi-square tests, were used to assess differences in efficiency, satisfaction, and tool preference. Qualitative insights revealed that students commonly switch between GPT and Google: using Google for credible, multi-source information and GPT for summarization, explanation, and drafting. While neither tool proved sufficient on its own, there was a strong demand for a hybrid solution. In response, we developed a prototype, a chatbot embedded within the search interface, that combines GPT's conversational capabilities with Google's reliability to enhance academic research and reduce cognitive load.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accte...</summary><p>Acctepted at the EMNLP 2025 HCI+NLP Workshop</p></details> |

However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities.

Despite the notable progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Undergraduate thesis (preprint)---submitted to Escola Polit\'ecnica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (POLI/UFRJ).

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues.

However, their scalability is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST, a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Forced migration, including refugee and asylum seekers, plays an important role in overall migration patterns, but is notoriously difficult to forecast. Focusing on refugees and asylum seekers, we propose a modeling pipeline based on Bayesian hierarchical time-series modeling for projecting refugee population official statistics by country of origin using data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Our approach is based on a conceptual model of refugee and asylum seeker populations following growth and decline phases, separated by a peak. The growth and decline phases are modeled by logistic growth and decline through an interrupted logistic process model. We evaluate our method through a set of validation exercises that show it has good performance for forecasts at 1, 5, and 10 year horizons, and we present projections for 35 countries of origin of large refugee and asylum seeker population.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%.

It is well known that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks, where deep layers capture abstract characteristics of data by combining lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for a representation which is absolutely abstract. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks and auto-encoders trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data get broader and as depth increases, in agreement with theoretical predictions.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

By leveraging a Lamperti transformation, we develop a novel, explicit, and unconditionally positivity-preserving numerical scheme for the considered financial SDEs. More precisely, an implicit term $c_{-1}Y_{n+1}^{-1}$ is incorporated in the scheme to guarantee unconditional positivity preservation, and a corrective operator is introduced in the remaining explicit terms to address the challenges posed by non-Lipschitz (possibly singular) coefficients of the transformed SDEs. By finding a unique positive root of a quadratic equation, the proposed scheme can be explicitly solved and is shown to be strongly convergent with order $1$, when used to numerically solve several well-known financial models such as the CIR process, the Heston-3/2 volatility model, the CEV process and the A\"it-Sahalia model.

Supported by the necessity of gradient information in deep learning, differentiable simulators have emerged as an effective tool for optimization and learning in physics simulations. In this work, we present our fluid simulator PICT, a differentiable pressure-implicit solver coded in PyTorch with Graphics-processing-unit (GPU) support. We first verify the accuracy of both the forward simulation and our derived gradients in various established benchmarks like lid-driven cavities and turbulent channel flows before we show that the gradients provided by our solver can be used to learn complicated turbulence models in 2D and 3D. We apply both supervised and unsupervised training regimes using physical priors to match flow statistics. In particular, we learn a stable sub-grid scale (SGS) model for a 3D turbulent channel flow purely based on reference statistics. The low-resolution corrector trained with our solver runs substantially faster than the highly resolved references, while keeping or even surpassing their accuracy. Finally, we give additional insights into the physical interpretation of different solver gradients, and motivate a physically informed regularization technique.

We develop a planar linkages dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework.</p></details> | 6pages, 6 figures |

Dyck edit distance measures how far a parenthesis string is from a well-parenthesized expression, while tree edit distance quantifies the minimum number of node insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one rooted, ordered, labeled tree into another. Despite extensive study, no prior work has addressed efficient dynamic algorithms for these problems, which naturally arise in evolving structured data such as LaTeX documents, JSON or XML files, and RNA secondary structures. Our main contribution is a set of reductions and decompositions that transform Dyck and tree edit distance instances into efficiently maintainable string edit distance instances, which can be approximated within a $n^{o(1)}$ factor in $n^{o(1)}$ update time. For Dyck edit distance, our reduction incurs only polylogarithmic overheads in approximation and update time, yielding an $n^{o(1)}$-approximation with $n^{o(1)}$ updates. For tree edit distance, we introduce a new static reduction that improves the best-known approximation ratio from $n^{3/4}$ to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ and removes the restriction to constant-degree trees. Extending this reduction dynamically achieves $n^{1/2+o(1)}$ approximation with $n^{o(1)}$ update time. A key component is a dynamic maintenance algorithm for history-independent heavy-light decompositions, of independent interest. We also provide a novel static and dynamic decomposition achieving an $O(k \log n)$-approximation when the tree edit distance is at most $k$. Combined with the trivial bound $k \le n$, this yields a dynamic deterministic $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$-approximation. In the static setting, our algorithm runs in near-linear time; dynamically, it requires only polylogarithmic updates, improving on prior linear-time static $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of a FOCS 2025 paper</p></details> |

Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

By finding a unique positive root of a quadratic equation, the proposed scheme can be explicitly solved and is shown to be strongly convergent with order $1$, when used to numerically solve several well-known financial models such as the CIR process, the Heston-3/2 volatility model, the CEV process and the A\"it-Sahalia model. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figures |
| **[NanoHTNet: Nano Human Topology Network for Efficient 3D Human Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15763v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is limited by resource-constrained edge devices, requiring more efficient models. A key approach to enhancing efficiency involves designing networks based on the structural characteristics of input data. However, effectively utilizing the structural priors in human skeletal inputs remains challenging. To address this, we leverage both explicit and implicit spatio-temporal priors of the human body through innovative model design and a pre-training proxy task. First, we propose a Nano Human Topology Network (NanoHTNet), a tiny 3D HPE network with stacked Hierarchical Mixers to capture explicit features. Specifically, the spatial Hierarchical Mixer efficiently learns the human physical topology across multiple semantic levels, while the temporal Hierarchical Mixer with discrete cosine transform and low-pass filtering captures local instantaneous movements and global action coherence. Moreover, Efficient Temporal-Spatial Tokenization (ETST) is introduced to enhance spatio-temporal interaction and reduce computational complexity significantly. Second, PoseCLR is proposed as a general pre-training method based on contrastive learning for 3D HPE, aimed at extracting implicit representations of human topology. By aligning 2D poses from diverse viewpoints in the proxy task, PoseCLR aids 3D HPE encoders like NanoHTNet in more effectively capturing the high-dimensional features of the human body, leading to further performance improvements. Extensive experiments verify that NanoHTNet with PoseCLR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in efficiency, making it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Jetson Nano.

This heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA), which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95 critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60) and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with 2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform scale in small-data medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

However, deep transformer models often suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations converge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics induced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete graph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a consequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics. Motivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which consists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We also introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to preserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby extending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed techniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that Wavy Transformer improves performance with minimal additional parameters and no extra hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 38 (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Principled Feature Disentanglement for High-Fidelity Unified Brain MRI Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14954v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multisequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a more reliable diagnosis in clinical applications through complementary information across sequences. However, in practice, the absence of certain MR sequences is a common problem that can lead to inconsistent analysis results. In this work, we propose a novel unified framework for synthesizing multisequence MR images, called hybrid-fusion GAN (HF-GAN). The fundamental mechanism of this work is principled feature disentanglement, which aligns the design of the architecture with the complexity of the features. A powerful many-to-one stream is constructed for the extraction of complex complementary features, while utilizing parallel, one-to-one streams to process modality-specific information. These disentangled features are dynamically integrated into a common latent space by a channel attention-based fusion module (CAFF) and then transformed via a modality infuser to generate the target sequence. We validated our framework on public datasets of both healthy and pathological brain MRI. Quantitative and qualitative results show that HF-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with our 2D slice-based framework notably outperforming a leading 3D volumetric model. Furthermore, the utilization of HF-GAN for data imputation substantially improves the performance of the downstream brain tumor segmentation task, demonstrating its clinical relevance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612 dataset, outperforming larger models.

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems. In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scales up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.

Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different percentages of available labels.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can translate images to code, they often fail on complex UIs, struggling to unify visual perception, layout planning, and code synthesis within a single monolithic model, which leads to frequent perception and planning errors. To address this, we propose ScreenCoder, a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes the task into three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. By assigning these distinct responsibilities to specialized agents, our framework achieves significantly higher robustness and fidelity than end-to-end approaches. Furthermore, ScreenCoder serves as a scalable data engine, enabling us to generate high-quality image-code pairs. We use this data to fine-tune open-source MLLM via a dual-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, demonstrating substantial gains in its UI generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement.

The method employs local linear regression with data-driven bandwidth selection to flexibly estimate spatial decay patterns and detect treatment effect boundaries. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the nonparametric approach exhibits lower bias and correctly identifies the absence of boundaries when none exist, unlike parametric methods that may impose spurious spatial patterns. I apply this framework to bank branch openings during 2015--2020, matching 5,743 new branches to 5.9 million mortgage applications across 14,209 census tracts. The analysis reveals that branch proximity significantly affects loan application volume (8.5\% decline per 10 miles) but not approval rates, consistent with branches stimulating demand through local presence while credit decisions remain centralized. Examining branch survival during the digital transformation era (2010--2023), I find a non-monotonic relationship with area income: high-income areas experience more closures despite conventional wisdom. This counterintuitive pattern reflects strategic consolidation of redundant branches in over-banked wealthy urban areas rather than discrimination against poor neighborhoods. Controlling for branch density, urbanization, and competition, the direct income effect diminishes substantially, with branch density emerging as the primary determinant of survival. These findings demonstrate the necessity of flexible nonparametric methods for detecting complex spatial patterns that parametric models would miss, and challenge simplistic narratives about banking deserts by revealing the organizational complexity underlying spatial consolidation decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in real-time wind forecasts (up to 30 minutes lead time). The model exhibits robustness across forecast horizons and different pressure levels, and its predictions for wind fields show superior agreement with ground-based radar wind profiler compared to concurrent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures; Minor text revisions; Updated the questions, some images in the article, the abstract, and the main text content</p></details> |

In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain, which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net) for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel compared to the RGB color space.

We demonstrate that motion vectors from AV1 video codec can serve as a high-quality and computationally efficient substitute for traditional optical flow, a critical but often resource-intensive component in many computer vision pipelines. Our primary contributions are twofold. First, we provide a detailed comparison of motion vectors from both AV1 and HEVC against ground-truth optical flow, establishing their fidelity. In particular we show the impact of encoder settings on motion estimation fidelity and make recommendations about the optimal settings. Second, we show that using these extracted AV1 motion vectors as a "warm-start" for a state-of-the-art deep learning-based optical flow method, RAFT, significantly reduces the time to convergence while achieving comparable accuracy. Specifically, we observe a four-fold speedup in computation time with only a minor trade- off in end-point error.

Existing assessments often rely on qualitative descriptions or composite indices, which can mask crucial differences between key domains such as mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk management, and loss and damage. To bridge this gap, we develop a quantitative indicator of climate policy orientation by applying a multilingual transformer-based language model to official national policy documents, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.90 (F1-score). Linking these indicators with World Bank development data in panel regressions reveals that mitigation policies are associated with higher GDP and GNI; disaster risk management correlates with greater GNI and debt but reduced foreign direct investment; adaptation and loss and damage show limited measurable effects. This integrated NLP-econometric framework enables comparable, theme-specific analysis of climate governance, offering a scalable method to monitor progress, evaluate trade-offs, and align policy emphasis with development goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper/proposal has been accepted as a poster in the NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

An Analysis of MetaFormer's Token Mixing for Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05971v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets, its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images. Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the necessary cross-channel interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/multimodallearning/MetaFormerMedImaging/tree/clean_code</p></details> |

The proposed architecture automates the voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote casting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart RFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using an RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontroller. Upon successful verification, the voter interacts with a touchscreen interface to cast a vote, which is then encrypted using AES-128 and securely stored on a local SD card or transmitted via GSM to a central server. A tamper-proof monitoring mechanism records each session with time-stamped digital signatures, ensuring auditability and data integrity. The architecture is designed to function in both online and offline modes, with an automated batch synchronization mechanism that updates vote records once network connectivity is restored. System testing in simulated environments confirmed 100% voter authentication accuracy, minimized latency (average voting time of 11.5 seconds), and robustness against cloning, double voting, and data interception. The integration of real-time monitoring and secure process control modules enables electoral authorities to automate data logging, detect anomalies, and validate system integrity dynamically. This work demonstrates a scalable, automation-driven solution for voting infrastructure, offering enhanced transparency, resilience, and deployment flexibility, especially in environments where digital transformation of electoral processes is critically needed.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 2 figures, 14 tables, 50 listings, EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |

A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, significantly outperforming the standard codec in non-rainy conditions with up to a +0.26 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement over H.264 codec, and maintaining a +0.18 SSIM improvement even in challenging rainy conditions, both measured at a block error rate (BLER) of 0.25.</p></details> | <details><summary>We mo...</summary><p>We modified abstract and conclusion due to modified Figs. 10 and 11, which show only BLER up to 0.3 (texts were modified for updated Figs. 10 and 11).

Given an input video and a simple user-provided text instruction describing the desired content, our method synthesizes dynamic objects or complex scene effects that naturally interact with the existing scene over time. The position, appearance, and motion of the new content are seamlessly integrated into the original footage while accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions with other dynamic objects in the scene, resulting in a cohesive and realistic output video. We achieve this via a zero-shot, training-free framework that harnesses a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer to synthesize the new content and a pre-trained vision-language model to envision the augmented scene in detail. Specifically, we introduce a novel inference-based method that manipulates features within the attention mechanism, enabling accurate localization and seamless integration of the new content while preserving the integrity of the original scene. Our method is fully automated, requiring only a simple user instruction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of edits applied to real-world videos, encompassing diverse objects and scenarios involving both camera and object motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dynvfx.github.io</p></details> |

Public serverless repositories have become key to accelerating the development of serverless applications. However, their growing popularity makes them attractive targets for adversaries. Despite this, the security posture of these repositories remains largely unexplored, exposing developers and organizations to potential risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the security landscape of serverless components hosted in public repositories. We analyse 2,758 serverless components from five widely used public repositories popular among developers and enterprises, and 125,936 Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates across three widely used IaC frameworks. Our analysis reveals systemic vulnerabilities including outdated software packages, misuse of sensitive parameters, exploitable deployment configurations, susceptibility to typo-squatting attacks and opportunities to embed malicious behaviour within compressed serverless components. Finally, we provide practical recommendations to mitigate these threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ESORICS 2025</p></details> |

Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.</p></details> | 5 pages |

This work investigates the distance-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), defined as the DoF when a user varies only its distance to the base station and not the angle. To obtain the distance-domain DoF, we study a line-of-sight (LoS) channel with a source representing a base station and an observation region representing users, where the source is a large two-dimensional transmit (Tx) array with arbitrary shape and the observation region is an arbitrarily long linear receive (Rx) array with collinearly aligned elements located at different distances from the Tx array. We assume that both the Tx and Rx arrays have continuous apertures with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the distance-domain DoF in the case of a finite number of elements. First, we analyze an ideal case where the Tx array is a single piece and the Rx array is on the broadside of the Tx array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the distance-domain DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the distance-domain DoF is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of both the Tx and Rx arrays rather than their detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method that converts the problem to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend the analytical framework to modular arrays and show the distance-domain DoF gain over a single-piece array under a fixed total physical length.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages and 15 figures.

In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA) architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when compared to SoTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (including References)</p></details> |

In this paper, we address the challenge of identifying spurious executions of plans specified as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula, as incorrect task sequences, violations of spatial constraints, timing inconsis- tencies, or deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN) paradigm, which coordinates robot actions with LTL-derived global mission specifications. We further propose a Transformer-based anomaly detection pipeline that classifies robot trajectories as normal or anomalous. Experi- mental evaluations show that our method achieves high accuracy (91.3%) in identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive anomalies (66.8%). An ablation experiment of the embedding and architecture was carried out, obtaining successful results where our novel proposition performs better than simpler representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,3 figures, Iberian Robotics Conference 2025</p></details> |

While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing. Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 |

However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states, i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECSQARU 2025</p></details> |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 15 figures.

| **[Seeing but Not Believing: Probing the Disconnect Between Visual Attention and Answer Correctness in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17771v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term ``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic understanding and reliability of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 Figures, |

However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Environmental Modelling & Software</p></details> |

However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Our approach efficiently combines gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or labels.

On the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Physics-informed neural network (PINN) incorporates physical information and knowledge into network topology or computational processes as model priors, with the unique advantage of achieving strong generalization with small data. This study aims to investigate the performance characteristics of the soft-constrained PINN method to solving typical linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) such as primer, Van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, especially the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness to noise with minimal data. It is verified that the soft-constrained PINN significantly reduces the need for labeled data. With the aid of appropriate collocation points no need to be labeled, it can predict and also extrapolate with minimal data. First-order and second-order ODEs, no matter linear or nonlinear oscillators, require only one and two training data (containing initial values) respectively, just like classical analytic or Runge-Kutta methods, and with equivalent precision and comparable efficiency (fast training in seconds for scalar ODEs). Furthermore, it can conveniently impose a physical law (e.g., conservation of energy) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, improving the performance to deal with various complexities such as nonlinearity like Duffing. The DeepXDE-based PINN implementation is light code and can be efficiently trained on both GPU and CPU platforms. The mathematical and computational framework of this alternative and feasible PINN method to ODEs, can be easily extended to PDEs, etc., and is becoming a favorable catalyst for the era of Digital Twins.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, etc</p></details> |

Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy. CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and lifecycle-aware systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, FLTA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Wild regenerative block bootstrap for Harris recurrent Markov chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17648v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider Gaussian and bootstrap approximations for the supremum of additive functionals of aperiodic Harris recurrent Markov chains. The supremum is taken over a function class that may depend on the sample size, which allows for non-Donsker settings; that is, the empirical process need not have a weak limit in the space of bounded functions. We first establish a non-asymptotic Gaussian approximation error, which holds at rates comparable to those for sums of high-dimensional independent or one-dependent vectors. Key to our derivation is the Nummelin splitting technique, which enables us to decompose the chain into either independent or one-dependent random blocks. Additionally, building upon the Nummelin splitting, we propose a Gaussian multiplier bootstrap for practical inference and establish its finite-sample guarantees in the strongly aperiodic case. Finally, we apply our bootstrap to construct a uniform confidence band for an invariant density within a certain class of diffusion processes.</p></details> | 47 pages |

In personalized medicine, for example, training a bandit from scratch for every patient is typically infeasible, as the number of trials required is much larger than the number of decision points for a single patient. To combat this, latent bandits offer rapid exploration and personalization beyond what context variables alone can offer, provided that a latent variable model of problem instances can be learned consistently. However, existing works give no guidance as to how such a model can be found. In this work, we propose an identifiable latent bandit framework that leads to optimal decision-making with a shorter exploration time than classical bandits by learning from historical records of decisions and outcomes. Our method is based on nonlinear independent component analysis that provably identifies representations from observational data sufficient to infer optimal actions in new bandit instances. We verify this strategy in simulated and semi-synthetic environments, showing substantial improvement over online and offline learning baselines when identifying conditions are satisfied.</p></details> | 29 pages, 17 figures |

The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11302v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection traditionally relies on costly manual annotation. We present the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised YOLO and zero-shot vision-language models (Gemini Flash 2.5 and GPT-4). Evaluated on 5,000 stratified COCO images and 500 diverse product images, combined with Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we derive break-even thresholds for architecture selection. Results show supervised YOLO attains 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for Gemini and 71.3% for GPT-4 on standard categories; the annotation expense for a 100-category system is $10,800, and the accuracy advantage only pays off beyond 55 million inferences (151,000 images/day for one year). On diverse product categories Gemini achieves 52.3% and GPT-4 55.1%, while supervised YOLO cannot detect untrained classes. Cost-per-correct-detection favors Gemini ($0.00050) and GPT-4 ($0.00067) over YOLO ($0.143) at 100,000 inferences. We provide decision frameworks showing that optimal architecture choice depends on inference volume, category stability, budget, and accuracy requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

This is the case for several models available in the multivariate extremes literature, particularly for the most flexible tail models, including those that interpolate between the two key dependence classes of `asymptotic dependence' and `asymptotic independence'. We focus on approaches that leverage neural networks to approximate Bayes estimators. In particular, we explore the properties of neural Bayes estimators for parameter inference for several flexible but computationally expensive models to fit, with a view to aiding their routine implementation. Owing to the absence of likelihood evaluation in the inference procedure, classical information criteria such as the Bayesian information criterion cannot be used to select the most appropriate model. Instead, we propose using neural networks as neural Bayes classifiers for model selection. Our goal is to provide a toolbox for simple, fast fitting and comparison of complex extreme-value dependence models, where the best model is selected for a given data set and its parameters subsequently estimated using neural Bayes estimation. We apply our classifiers and estimators to analyse the pairwise extremal behaviour of changes in horizontal geomagnetic field fluctuations at three different locations.</p></details> | 48 pages, 11 figures |

Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD, which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities (2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class, inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial, biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented 99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and 97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design, computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of CVPR2025</p></details> |

Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-M...</summary><p>Pre-MIT Press publication version, has been accepted by TACL</p></details> |

Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612 dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment with a 6.75 ms inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, accepted to IEEE EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER) 2025.

Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

This method combines a main speech enhancement task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the baseline model.

These models are motivated by multi-modal learning and form the standard generative setting underlying Partial Least Squares (PLS), a widely used yet theoretically underdeveloped method. We show that the leading singular values of the sample cross-covariance matrix undergo a Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP)-type phase transition, and we characterize the precise thresholds for the emergence of informative components. Our results yield the first sharp asymptotic description of the signal recovery capabilities of PLS in this setting, revealing a fundamental performance gap between PLS and the Bayes-optimal estimator. In particular, we identify the SNR and correlation regimes where PLS fails to recover any signal, despite detectability being possible in principle. These findings clarify the theoretical limits of PLS and provide guidance for the design of reliable multi-modal inference methods in high dimensions.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |

For general fast goodness-of-fit tests in high dimensions, kernelised Stein discrepancy (KSD) tests are a powerful tool. Here, we develop a KSD-type test for IRG models that can be carried out with a single observation of the network. The test applies to a network of any size, but is particularly interesting for small networks for which asymptotic tests are not warranted. We also provide theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | 49 pages, 24 figures |

We study edge-cloud cascades that must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set, it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based (CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA) to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate, and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning via Explained Variance Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07170v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for a specific downstream task. The most common fine-tuning method is to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing initialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions (SVD) of gradients or weight matrices. However, they do not provably maximize the expected gradient signal, which is critical for fast adaptation. To this end, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme that uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably maximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA performs incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the right-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by selecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given rank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of trainable parameters. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution. In summary, EVA establishes a new Pareto frontier compared to existing LoRA initialization schemes in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025, Shared first authorship, Code available at https://github.com/ml-jku/EVA</p></details> |

The radiation condition is approximated by a Cartesian perfectly-matched layer (PML). The domain-decomposition subdomains are overlapping hyperrectangles with Cartesian PMLs at their boundaries. In a recent paper ({\tt arXiv:2404.02156}), the current authors proved (for both variants) that, after a specified number of iterations -- depending on the behaviour of the geometric-optic rays -- the error is smooth and smaller than any negative power of the wavenumber $k$. For the parallel method, the specified number of iterations is less than the maximum number of subdomains, counted with their multiplicity, that a geometric-optic ray can intersect. The theory, which is given at the continuous level and makes essential use of semi-classical analysis, assumes that the overlaps of the subdomains and the widths of the PMLs are all independent of the wavenumber. In this paper we extend the results of {\tt arXiv:2404.02156} by experimentally studying the behaviour of the methods in the practically important case when both the overlap and the PML width decrease as the wavenumber increases. We find that (at least for constant wavespeed), the methods remain robust to increasing $k$, even for miminal overlap, when the PML is one wavelength wide.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

While post-training quantization techniques effectively reduce memory overhead, existing methods predominantly rely on static quantization strategies, which struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads. To address this, we propose FlexQuant, a dynamic precision-switching framework that optimizes the trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Leveraging model perplexity entropy and Kullback-Leibler divergence, FlexQuant enables fine-grained, layer-wise mixed-precision quantization and dynamically adjusts bit-widths during each token generation. FlexQuant provides a comprehensive analysis of quantization strategies, introduces a precision requirement model for optimal switching, and implements efficient fine-grained precision management. Evaluations demonstrate that FlexQuant achieves a 1.3x end-to-end speedup across diverse language tasks with negligible accuracy loss introduced. This framework offers a flexible and adaptive solution for efficient LLM deployment.

However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement.

Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: http://simbench.tiancheng.hu/ Data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/pitehu/SimBench</p></details> |

Starting from fundamental fluid dynamics equations (Navier-Stokes), we derive conditions under which treatment effects decay exponentially in space and time, enabling researchers to calculate explicit boundaries beyond which effects become undetectable. The framework encompasses both linear (pure diffusion) and nonlinear (advection-diffusion with chemical reactions) regimes, with testable scope conditions based on dimensionless numbers from physics (P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers). We demonstrate the framework's diagnostic capability using air pollution from coal-fired power plants. Analyzing 791 ground-based PM$_{2.5}$ monitors and 189,564 satellite-based NO$_2$ grid cells in the Western United States over 2019-2021, we find striking regional heterogeneity: within 100 km of coal plants, both pollutants show positive spatial decay (PM$_{2.5}$: $\kappa_s = 0.00200$, $d^* = 1,153$ km; NO$_2$: $\kappa_s = 0.00112$, $d^* = 2,062$ km), validating the framework. Beyond 100 km, negative decay parameters correctly signal that urban sources dominate and diffusion assumptions fail. Ground-level PM$_{2.5}$ decays approximately twice as fast as satellite column NO$_2$, consistent with atmospheric transport physics. The framework successfully diagnoses its own validity in four of eight analyzed regions, providing researchers with physics-based tools to assess whether their spatial difference-in-differences setting satisfies diffusion assumptions before applying the estimator. Our results demonstrate that rigorous boundary detection requires both theoretical derivation from first principles and empirical validation of underlying physical assumptions.</p></details> | 56 pages, 4 figures |
| **[KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00783v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |

Embedding geological knowledge directly into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data, especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best leverage them in support of geological interpretation.</p></details> | 52 pages, 42 figures |

Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care (MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge.

| **[Explainable AI for microseismic event detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17458v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors. On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of 0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet (F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated seismic detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Artificial Intelligence in Geosciences</p></details> |
| **[Active Inference for an Intelligent Agent in Autonomous Reconnaissance Missions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17450v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 6th International Workshop on Active Inference, 15-17 October 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging AV1 motion vectors for Fast and Dense Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17434v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ICIR 2025, camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16538v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in visual understanding but often lack reliable grounding capabilities and actionable inference rates. Integrating them with open-vocabulary object detection (OVD), instance segmentation, and tracking leverages their strengths while mitigating these drawbacks. We utilize VLM-generated structured descriptions to identify visible object instances, collect application-relevant attributes, and inform an open-vocabulary detector to extract corresponding bounding boxes that are passed to a video segmentation model providing segmentation masks and tracking. Once initialized, this model directly extracts segmentation masks, processing image streams in real time with minimal computational overhead. Tracks can be updated online as needed by generating new structured descriptions and detections. This combines the descriptive power of VLMs with the grounding capability of OVD and the pixel-level understanding and speed of video segmentation. Our evaluation across datasets and robotics platforms demonstrates the broad applicability of this approach, showcasing its ability to extract task-specific attributes from non-standard objects in dynamic environments.

| **[Monitoring Horses in Stalls: From Object to Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17409v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall. To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and stable management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[TopSeg: A Multi-Scale Topological Framework for Data-Efficient Heart Sound Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17346v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches for heart-sound (PCG) segmentation built on time--frequency features can be accurate but often rely on large expert-labeled datasets, limiting robustness and deployment. We present TopSeg, a topological representation-centric framework that encodes PCG dynamics with multi-scale topological features and decodes them using a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) with an order- and duration-constrained inference step. To evaluate data efficiency and generalization, we train exclusively on PhysioNet 2016 dataset with subject-level subsampling and perform external validation on CirCor dataset. Under matched-capacity decoders, the topological features consistently outperform spectrogram and envelope inputs, with the largest margins at low data budgets; as a full system, TopSeg surpasses representative end-to-end baselines trained on their native inputs under the same budgets while remaining competitive at full data. Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability. These results indicate that topology-aware representations provide a strong inductive bias for data-efficient, cross-dataset PCG segmentation, supporting practical use when labeled data are limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper has submitted to ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[DDSC: Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum for Data-Efficient Acoustic Scene Classification under Domain Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17345v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic scene classification (ASC) suffers from device-induced domain shift, especially when labels are limited. Prior work focuses on curriculum-based training schedules that structure data presentation by ordering or reweighting training examples from easy-to-hard to facilitate learning; however, existing curricula are static, fixing the ordering or the weights before training and ignoring that example difficulty and marginal utility evolve with the learned representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum (DDSC), a training schedule that adapts the curriculum online by combining two signals computed each epoch: a domain-invariance signal and a learning-progress signal. A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into per-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs and progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead. Under the official DCASE 2024 Task~1 protocol, DDSC consistently improves cross-device performance across diverse ASC baselines and label budgets, with the largest gains on unseen-device splits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper has submitted to ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[DynVFX: Augmenting Real Videos with Dynamic Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03621v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for augmenting real-world videos with newly generated dynamic content. Given an input video and a simple user-provided text instruction describing the desired content, our method synthesizes dynamic objects or complex scene effects that naturally interact with the existing scene over time. The position, appearance, and motion of the new content are seamlessly integrated into the original footage while accounting for camera motion, occlusions, and interactions with other dynamic objects in the scene, resulting in a cohesive and realistic output video. We achieve this via a zero-shot, training-free framework that harnesses a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion transformer to synthesize the new content and a pre-trained vision-language model to envision the augmented scene in detail. Specifically, we introduce a novel inference-based method that manipulates features within the attention mechanism, enabling accurate localization and seamless integration of the new content while preserving the integrity of the original scene. Our method is fully automated, requiring only a simple user instruction. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide range of edits applied to real-world videos, encompassing diverse objects and scenarios involving both camera and object motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dynvfx.github.io</p></details> |

Our benchmark excels in three key areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities, focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset and code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LongInsightBench-910F/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ARR Rolling Review</p></details> |
| **[Every Rollout Counts: Optimal Resource Allocation for Efficient Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15707v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[How News Feels: Understanding Affective Bias in Multilingual Headlines for Human-Centered Media Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17252v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment, and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

| **[Latent Denoising Makes Good Visual Tokenizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15856v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective -- reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective, encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer (l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new perspectives for future tokenizer design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/Jiawei-Yang/DeTok</p></details> |
| **[SeC: Advancing Complex Video Object Segmentation via Progressive Concept Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15852v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://rookiexiong7.github.io/projects/SeC/; code: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC; dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS</p></details> |
| **[The Other Mind: How Language Models Exhibit Human Temporal Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15851v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

| **[Iterative thresholding low-rank time integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15848v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop time integration methods in low-rank representation that can adaptively adjust approximation ranks to achieve a prescribed accuracy, while ensuring that these ranks remain proportional to the corresponding best approximation ranks. Our approach relies on an iterative scheme combined with soft thresholding of the iterates. A model case of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with low-rank matrix approximation is analyzed in detail, and the required modifications for second-order parabolic problems are described. Numerical tests illustrate the results for both cases.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization for Adaptive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15844v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets, aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/zju-real/hbpo Project Page:https://zju-real.github.io/hbpo/</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Conditional Causal Effects in MPDAGs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15842v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider identifying a conditional causal effect when a graph is known up to a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). An MPDAG represents an equivalence class of graphs that is restricted by background knowledge and where all variables in the causal model are observed. We provide three results that address identification in this setting: an identification formula when the conditioning set is unaffected by treatment, a generalization of the well-known do calculus to the MPDAG setting, and an algorithm that is complete for identifying these conditional effects.</p></details> | 67 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13334v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1400 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ongoi...</summary><p>ongoing work; 166 pages, 1411 citations</p></details> |
| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space, allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Multi-Strategy Improved Snake Optimizer Accelerated CNN-LSTM-Attention-Adaboost for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15832v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the limitations of medium- and long-term four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction models, this paper proposes a hybrid CNN-LSTM-attention-adaboost neural network model incorporating a multi-strategy improved snake-herd optimization (SO) algorithm. The model applies the Adaboost algorithm to divide multiple weak learners, and each submodel utilizes CNN to extract spatial features, LSTM to capture temporal features, and attention mechanism to capture global features comprehensively. The strong learner model, combined with multiple sub-models, then optimizes the hyperparameters of the prediction model through the natural selection behavior pattern simulated by SO. In this study, based on the real ADS-B data from Xi'an to Tianjin, the comparison experiments and ablation studies of multiple optimizers are carried out, and a comprehensive test and evaluation analysis is carried out. The results show that SO-CLA-adaboost outperforms traditional optimizers such as particle swarm, whale, and gray wolf in handling large-scale high-dimensional trajectory data. In addition, introducing the full-strategy collaborative improvement SO algorithm improves the model's prediction accuracy by 39.89%.</p></details> | in Chinese language |
| **[Efficient Multi-Camera Tokenization with Triplanes for End-to-End Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12251v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive Transformers are increasingly being deployed as end-to-end robot and autonomous vehicle (AV) policy architectures, owing to their scalability and potential to leverage internet-scale pretraining for generalization. Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Federated Split Learning with Improved Communication and Storage Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15816v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning (ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server. Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |
| **[LLM Economist: Large Population Models and Mechanism Design in Multi-Agent Generative Simulacra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15815v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the LLM Economist, a novel framework that uses agent-based modeling to design and assess economic policies in strategic environments with hierarchical decision-making. At the lower level, bounded rational worker agents -- instantiated as persona-conditioned prompts sampled from U.S. Census-calibrated income and demographic statistics -- choose labor supply to maximize text-based utility functions learned in-context. At the upper level, a planner agent employs in-context reinforcement learning to propose piecewise-linear marginal tax schedules anchored to the current U.S. federal brackets. This construction endows economic simulacra with three capabilities requisite for credible fiscal experimentation: (i) optimization of heterogeneous utilities, (ii) principled generation of large, demographically realistic agent populations, and (iii) mechanism design -- the ultimate nudging problem -- expressed entirely in natural language. Experiments with populations of up to one hundred interacting agents show that the planner converges near Stackelberg equilibria that improve aggregate social welfare relative to Saez solutions, while a periodic, persona-level voting procedure furthers these gains under decentralized governance. These results demonstrate that large language model-based agents can jointly model, simulate, and govern complex economic systems, providing a tractable test bed for policy evaluation at the societal scale to help build better civilizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, Code: https://github.com/sethkarten/LLM-Economist</p></details> |
| **[Hyperelastic nature of the Hoek-Brown criterion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15813v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a nonlinear elasto-plastic model, for which a specific class of hyperbolic elasticity arises as a straight consequence of the yield criterion invariance on the plasticity level. We superimpose this nonlinear elastic (or hyperelastic) behavior with plasticity obeying the associated flow rule. Interestingly, we find that a linear yield criterion on the thermodynamical force associated with plasticity results in a quadratic yield criterion in the stress space. This suggests a specific hyperelastic connection between Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown (or alternatively between Drucker-Prager and Pan-Hudson) yield criteria. We compare the elasto-plastic responses of standard tests for the Drucker-Prager yield criterion using either linear or the suggested hyperbolic elasticity. Notably, the nonlinear case stands out due to dilatancy saturation observed during cyclic loading in the triaxial compression test. We conclude this study with structural finite element simulations that clearly demonstrate the numerical applicability of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in European Journal of Mechanics - A/Solids</p></details> |
| **[True Multimodal In-Context Learning Needs Attention to the Visual Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15807v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities.

| **[ConformalSAM: Unlocking the Potential of Foundational Segmentation Models in Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15803v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Fluid Antenna-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing, Computing and Semantic Communication for Emerging Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15800v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only, thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio. Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher data rates and better privacy preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications and Networking</p></details> |
| **[Deterministic Quantum Search via Recursive Oracle Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15797v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel deterministic quantum search algorithm that provides a practical alternative to conventional probabilistic search approaches. Our scheme eliminates the inherent uncertainty of quantum search without relying on arbitrary phase rotations, a key limitation of other deterministic methods. The algorithm achieves certainty by recursively expanding the base oracle so that it marks all states prefixed by the same two bits as the target, encompassing exactly one-quarter of the search space. This enables a step-by-step reduction of the superposition until the target state can be measured with certainty. The algorithm achieves deterministic success with a query complexity of $O(N^{\log_2(3)/2}) \approx O(N^{0.7925})$, falling between Grover's $O(\sqrt{N})$ scaling and the classical $O(N)$. Our approach relies exclusively on two-qubit nearest-neighbour diffusion operators, avoiding global diffusion entirely. We show that, despite the increased query complexity, this design reduces the total number of two-qubit gates required for diffusion by more than an order of magnitude for search spaces up to at least 18 qubits, with even greater advantages on hardware with limited qubit connectivity. The scheme's inherent determinism, reliance on simple nearest-neighbour, low-depth operations, and scalable recursive structure make it well-suited for hardware implementation. Additionally, we show that the algorithm naturally supports partial database search, enabling deterministic identification of selected target bits without requiring a full search, further broadening its applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Regularized Low-Rank Adaptation for Few-Shot Organ Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15793v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function, and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and robustness against suboptimal rank initialization.

| **[Reservoir Computing as a Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15779v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse. In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures, which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Building on this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference. We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily bound to their underlying model architectures.</p></details> | 3 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Learning Null Geodesics for Gravitational Lensing Rendering in General Relativity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15775v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GravLensX, an innovative method for rendering black holes with gravitational lensing effects using neural networks. The methodology involves training neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then employing these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by gravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black holes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time required for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our approach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with superposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate visualizations with significantly $15\times$ reduced computational time. Our findings suggest that neural networks offer a promising alternative for rendering complex astrophysical phenomena, potentially paving a new path to astronomical visualization.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones. Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use as the final predictor.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

While the use of large language models (LLMs) in economics is growing exponentially, their assumptions on economic issues remain a black box. This paper uses a conjoint experiment to tease out the main factors influencing LLMs' evaluation of economic policy. It finds that LLMs are most sensitive to unemployment, inequality, financial stability, and environmental harm and less sensitive to traditional macroeconomic concerns such as economic growth, inflation, and government debt. The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 tables |

To address this challenge, we propose a proactive blockage prediction framework that utilizes multi-modal sensing, including camera, GPS, LiDAR, and radar inputs in an infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) setting. This approach uses modality-specific deep learning models to process each sensor stream independently and fuses their outputs using a softmax-weighted ensemble strategy based on validation performance. Our evaluations, for up to 1.5s in advance, show that the camera-only model achieves the best standalone trade-off with an F1-score of 97.1% and an inference time of 89.8ms. A camera+radar configuration further improves accuracy to 97.2% F1 at 95.7ms. Our results display the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal sensing for mmWave blockage prediction and provide a pathway for proactive wireless communication in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers 2025</p></details> |

Although existing methods achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design, improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then, based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses, enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall (UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced scenarios.

Traditional approaches often treat them separately, limiting the ability for interactive planning. While recent diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in multi-agent trajectory generation, their slow sampling is less suitable for high-frequency planning tasks. In this paper, we leverage the consistency model to build a predictive planner that samples from a joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents, conditioned on the ego vehicle's navigational goal. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates higher-quality trajectories with fewer sampling steps than standard diffusion models, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. To enforce multiple planning constraints simultaneously on the ego trajectory, a novel online guided sampling approach inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is introduced. Evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), our method enables proactive behavior such as nudging and yielding, and also demonstrates smoother, safer, and more efficient trajectories and satisfaction of multiple constraints under a limited computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) 2025</p></details> |

However, discrepancies between these textbooks and the parametric knowledge inherent in Large Language Models (LLMs) can undermine the effectiveness of RAG systems. To systematically investigate RAG system robustness against such knowledge discrepancies, we introduce KnowShiftQA. This novel question answering dataset simulates these discrepancies by applying deliberate hypothetical knowledge updates to both answers and source documents, reflecting how textbook knowledge can shift. KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies. Furthermore, questions requiring the integration of contextual (textbook) knowledge with parametric (LLM) knowledge pose a significant challenge to current LLMs.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

Accurate path loss predictions can optimize use of the radio frequency spectrum and minimize unwanted interference. Modern path loss modeling often leverages data-driven approaches, using machine learning to train models on drive test measurement datasets. Drive tests primarily represent downlink scenarios, where the Tx is located on a building and the Rx is located on a moving vehicle. Consequently, trained models are frequently reserved for downlink coverage estimation, lacking representation of uplink scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that data augmentation can be used to train a path loss model that is generalized to uplink, downlink, and backhaul scenarios, training using only downlink drive test measurements. By adding a small number of synthetic samples representing uplink scenarios to the training set, root mean squared error is reduced by > 8 dB on uplink examples in the test set.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless, maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a common challenge across all models.</p></details> | <details><summary>For o...</summary><p>For our code and data, see https://github.com/nerchio/Human_Chatbot-Generation</p></details> |

These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction quality while maintaining high training efficiency.

Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.</p></details> | 34 pages |

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, learn directly from image data, radiomics-based models extract handcrafted features, offering potential advantages in data-limited scenarios. We systematically compared the diagnostic performance of various AI models, including Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons for radiomics, against state-of-the-art deep learning models such as InceptionV3, EfficientNetL, and ConvNeXtXLarge. Performance was evaluated across multiple sample sizes. At 24 samples, EfficientNetL achieved an AUC of 0.839, outperforming SVM (AUC = 0.762). At 4000 samples, InceptionV3 achieved the highest AUC of 0.996, compared to 0.885 for Random Forest. A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>one f...</summary><p>one figure updated for improved visual clarity; fixed inconsistencies and redundancies</p></details> |

Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://rookiexiong7.github.io/projects/SeC/; code: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC; dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS</p></details> |
| **[The Other Mind: How Language Models Exhibit Human Temporal Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15851v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space, allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

We superimpose this nonlinear elastic (or hyperelastic) behavior with plasticity obeying the associated flow rule. Interestingly, we find that a linear yield criterion on the thermodynamical force associated with plasticity results in a quadratic yield criterion in the stress space. This suggests a specific hyperelastic connection between Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown (or alternatively between Drucker-Prager and Pan-Hudson) yield criteria. We compare the elasto-plastic responses of standard tests for the Drucker-Prager yield criterion using either linear or the suggested hyperbolic elasticity. Notably, the nonlinear case stands out due to dilatancy saturation observed during cyclic loading in the triaxial compression test. We conclude this study with structural finite element simulations that clearly demonstrate the numerical applicability of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in European Journal of Mechanics - A/Solids</p></details> |

Various methods have been developed to construct hypergraphs -- referred to as simplicial complexes in the TDA framework -- over datasets, enabling the formation of edges between more than two vertices. This paper addresses the challenge of constructing hypergraphs from collections of multivariate time series. While prior work has focused on the case of a single multivariate time series, we extend this framework to handle collections of such time series. Our approach generalizes the method proposed in Chretien and al. by leveraging the properties of signature transforms to introduce controlled randomness, thereby enhancing the robustness of the construction process.

Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse. In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures, which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Building on this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference. We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily bound to their underlying model architectures.</p></details> | 3 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Interaction as Intelligence: Deep Research With Human-AI Partnership](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15759v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces "Interaction as Intelligence" research series, presenting a reconceptualization of human-AI relationships in deep research tasks. Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for accessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We propose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of intelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research tasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an essential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems adopt an "input-wait-output" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive results after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade effects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during investigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address these limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the human role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement where humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at critical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations: (1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI reasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional dialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts to user behaviors without explicit instruction. User evaluation demonstrates that this cognitive oversight paradigm outperforms the strongest baseline across six key metrics: Transparency(+20.0%), Fine-Grained Interaction(+29.2%), Real-Time Intervention(+18.5%), Ease of Collaboration(+27.7%), Results-Worth-Effort(+8.8%), and Interruptibility(+20.7%). Evaluations on challenging research problems show 31.8% to 50.0% points of improvements over deep research systems.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |

These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, NeurIPS 2025 under review</p></details> |

A Scheirer-Ray-Hare test confirmed significant main and interaction effects of model type and sample size on all metrics. Post hoc Mann-Whitney U tests with Bonferroni correction further revealed consistent performance advantages for deep learning models across most conditions. These findings provide statistically validated, data-driven recommendations for model selection in diagnostic AI. Deep learning models demonstrated higher performance and better scalability with increasing data availability, while radiomics-based models may remain useful in low-data contexts. This study addresses a critical gap in AI-based diagnostic research by offering practical guidance for deploying AI models across diverse clinical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>one f...</summary><p>one figure updated for improved visual clarity; fixed inconsistencies and redundancies</p></details> |
| **[A Fisher's exact test justification of the TF-IDF term-weighting scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15742v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the $p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 tables |

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To (Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference, an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips, reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive simulations.

Yet, these models often rely on relaxed Bayesian assumptions, omitting critical uncertainty information needed for robust decision-making. The resulting reliance on point estimates has fueled interest in probabilistic segmentation, but the literature remains fragmented. In response, this review consolidates and contextualizes foundational concepts in uncertainty modeling, including the non-trivial task of distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and examining their roles across four key downstream segmentation tasks, highlighting Active Learning as particularly promising. By unifying theory, terminology, and applications, we provide a coherent foundation for researchers and identify critical challenges, such as strong assumptions in spatial aggregation, lack of standardized benchmarks, and pitfalls in current uncertainty quantification methods. We identify trends such as the adoption of contemporary generative models, driven by advances in the broader field of generative modeling, with segmentation-specific innovation primarily in the conditioning mechanisms. Moreover, we observe growing interest in distribution- and sampling-free approaches to uncertainty estimation. We further propose directions for advancing uncertainty-aware segmentation in deep learning, including pragmatic strategies for disentangling different sources of uncertainty, novel uncertainty modeling approaches and improved Transformer-based backbones. In this way, we aim to support the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable segmentation models that effectively incorporate uncertainty into real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages of content, revised a few times</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15724v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Estimating Rate-Distortion Functions Using the Energy-Based Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15700v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rate-distortion (RD) theory is one of the key concepts in information theory, providing theoretical limits for compression performance and guiding the source coding design, with both theoretical and practical significance. The Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, as a classical algorithm to compute RD functions, encounters computational challenges when applied to high-dimensional scenarios. In recent years, many neural methods have attempted to compute high-dimensional RD problems from the perspective of implicit generative models. Nevertheless, these approaches often neglect the reconstruction of the optimal conditional distribution or rely on unreasonable prior assumptions. In face of these issues, we propose an innovative energy-based modeling framework that leverages the connection between the RD dual form and the free energy in statistical physics, achieving effective reconstruction of the optimal conditional distribution.The proposed algorithm requires training only a single neural network and circumvents the challenge of computing the normalization factor in energy-based models using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Experimental results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in estimating high-dimensional RD functions and reconstructing the optimal conditional distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and 21.95% compared to SparsePCGC.

| **[Oracle Separations for RPH](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09279v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While theoretical computer science primarily works with discrete models of computation, like the Turing machine and the wordRAM, there are many scenarios in which introducing real computation models is more adequate. We want to compare real models of computation with discrete models of computation. We do this by means of oracle separation results. We define the notion of a real Turing machine as an extension of the (binary) Turing machine by adding a real tape. Using those machines, we define and study the real polynomial hierarchy RPH. We are interested in RPH as the first level of the hierarchy corresponds to the well-known complexity class ER. It is known that $NP \subseteq ER \subseteq PSPACE$ and furthermore $PH \subseteq RPH \subseteq PSPACE$. We are interested to know if any of those inclusions are tight. In the absence of unconditional separations of complexity classes, we turn to oracle separation. We develop a technique that allows us to transform oracle separation results from the binary world to the real world. As applications, we show there are oracles such that: - $RPH^O$ proper subset of $PSPACE^O$, - $\Sigma_{k+1}^O$ not contained in $\Sigma_kR^O$, for all $k\geq 0$, - $\Sigma_kR^O$ proper subset of $\Sigma_{k+1}R^O$, for all $k\geq 0$, - $BQP^O$ not contained in $RPH^O$. Our results indicate that ER is strictly contained in PSPACE and that there is a separation between the different levels of the real polynomial hierarchy. We also bound the power of real computations by showing that NP-hard problems are unlikely to be solvable using polynomial time on a realRAM. Furthermore, our oracle separations indicate that polynomial-time quantum computing cannot be simulated on an efficient real Turing machine.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 3 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

To deepen our understanding of their sequential modeling capabilities, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study them. A key finding is that when trained on first-order Markov chains, transformers with two or more layers consistently develop an induction head mechanism to estimate the in-context bigram conditional distribution. In contrast, single-layer transformers, unable to form an induction head, directly learn the Markov kernel but often face a surprising challenge: they become trapped in local minima representing the unigram distribution, whereas deeper models reliably converge to the ground-truth bigram. While single-layer transformers can theoretically model first-order Markov chains, their empirical failure to learn this simple kernel in practice remains a curious phenomenon. To explain this contrasting behavior of single-layer models, in this paper we introduce a new framework for a principled analysis of transformers via Markov chains. Leveraging our framework, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima (bigram) and bad local minima (unigram) contingent on data properties and model architecture. We precisely delineate the regimes under which these local optima occur. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results. Finally, we outline several open problems in this arena.

| **[Multi-Stage Prompt Inference Attacks on Enterprise LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15613v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place. We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both attacks and defenses.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Prompt2DEM: High-Resolution DEMs for Urban and Open Environments from Global Prompts Using a Monocular Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09681v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution elevation estimations are essential to understand catchment and hillslope hydrology, study urban morphology and dynamics, and monitor the growth, decline, and mortality of terrestrial ecosystems. Various deep learning approaches (e.g., super-resolution techniques, monocular depth estimation) have been developed to create high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). However, super-resolution techniques are limited by the upscaling factor, and monocular depth estimation lacks global elevation context, making its conversion to a seamless DEM restricted. The recently introduced technique of prompt-based monocular depth estimation has opened new opportunities to extract estimates of absolute elevation in a global context. We present here a framework for the estimation of high-resolution DEMs as a new paradigm for absolute global elevation mapping. It is exemplified using low-resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data as prompts and high-resolution RGB imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The approach fine-tunes a vision transformer encoder with LiDAR-derived DEMs and employs a versatile prompting strategy, enabling tasks such as DEM estimation, void filling, and updating. Our framework achieves a 100x resolution gain (from 30-m to 30-cm), surpassing prior methods by an order of magnitude. Evaluations across three diverse U.S. landscapes show robust generalization, capturing urban structures and fine-scale terrain features with < 5 m MAE relative to LiDAR, improving over SRTM by up to 18%. Hydrological analysis confirms suitability for hazard and environmental studies. We demonstrate scalability by applying the framework to large regions in the U.S. and Israel.

However, traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method. To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed, revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Seismological Research Letters</p></details> |

However, they still struggle with non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge, we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer) framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets.

Various deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Graph Neural Networks, and the recent Transformer, have been developed. However, despite the increasing complexity of these models, the performance gain has not been as salient. This raises a question: Does increasing model complexity necessarily lead to higher classification accuracy? In this paper, we revisit the simplest deep learning architecture, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and propose a pure MLP-based method, named BrainNetMLP, for functional brain network classification, which capitalizes on the advantages of MLP, including efficient computation and fewer parameters. Moreover, BrainNetMLP incorporates a dual-branch structure to jointly capture both spatial connectivity and spectral information, enabling precise spatiotemporal feature fusion. We evaluate our proposed BrainNetMLP on two public and popular brain network classification datasets, the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Experimental results demonstrate pure MLP-based methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance, revealing the potential of MLP-based models as more efficient yet effective alternatives in functional brain network classification.

Most existing approaches rely on implicit 3D representations, which produce overly smooth reconstructions and are time-consuming to generate explicit 3D shapes. While more recent methods directly reconstruct point clouds with diffusion models, the multi-step denoising makes high-resolution reconstruction inefficient. To address these limitations, we propose a transformer-based model to efficiently reconstruct dense 3D point clouds of hand-held objects. Our method follows a coarse-to-fine strategy, first generating a sparse point cloud from the image and progressively refining it into a dense representation using pixel-aligned image features. To enhance reconstruction accuracy, we integrate image features with 3D hand geometry to jointly predict the object point cloud and its pose relative to the hand. Our model is trained end-to-end for optimal performance. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much faster inference speed, while generalizing well to in-the-wild images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025.

| **[The New LLM Bottleneck: A Systems Perspective on Latent Attention and Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15465v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational workloads composing traditional Transformer models are starkly bifurcated. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is memory-bound, with low arithmetic intensity, while feedforward layers are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the MHA bottleneck. This paper argues that recent architectural shifts, namely Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), challenge the premise of specialized attention hardware. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that of MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern accelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match that of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile. These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware. The central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer accelerating a single memory-bound layer. Instead, the focus must shift to designing balanced systems with sufficient compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and high-bandwidth interconnects to manage the diverse demands of large-scale models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |

The Transformer, as a flow map, exists in the tangent fiber for each token along the high-dimensional unit sphere. The circumstance of the hypersphere across the latent data is reasonable due to the trained diagonal matrix equal to the identity, which has various empirical justifications. Thus, under the continuum limit of the dynamics, the latent vectors flow among the tangent bundle. Using these facts, we devise a mathematical framework for the Transformer through calculus of variations. We develop a functional and show that the continuous flow map induced by the Transformer satisfies this functional, therefore the Transformer can be viewed as a natural solver of a calculus of variations problem. We invent new scenarios of when our methods are applicable based on loss optimization with respect to path optimality. We derive the Euler-Lagrange equation for the Transformer. The variant of the Euler-Lagrange equation we present has various appearances in literature, but, to our understanding, oftentimes not foundationally proven or under other specialized cases. Our overarching proof is new: our techniques are classical and the use of the flow map object is original. We provide several other relevant results, primarily ones specific to neural scenarios. In particular, much of our analysis will be attempting to quantify Transformer data in variational contexts under neural approximations. Calculus of variations on manifolds is a well-nourished research area, but for the Transformer specifically, it is uncharted: we lay the foundation for this area through an introduction to the Lagrangian for the Transformer.</p></details> | First version |

This study addresses binary VPN detection, distinguishing VPN-encrypted from non-VPN traffic using wavelet transform-based features across multiple machine learning models. Unlike previous studies focused on application-level classification within encrypted traffic, we specifically evaluate the fundamental task of VPN identification regardless of application type. We analyze the impact of wavelet decomposition levels and dataset filtering on classification performance across significantly imbalanced data, where filtering reduces some traffic categories by up to 95%. Our results demonstrate that Random Forest (RF) achieves superior performance with an F1-score of 99%, maintaining robust accuracy even after significant dataset filtering. Neural Networks (NN) show comparable effectiveness with an F1-score of 98% when trained on wavelet level 12, while Support Vector Machines (SVM) exhibit notable sensitivity to dataset reduction, with F1-scores dropping from 90% to 85% after filtering. Comparing wavelet decomposition at levels 5 and 12, we observe improved classification performance at level 12, particularly for variable traffic types, though the marginal gains may not justify the additional computational overhead. These findings establish RF as the most reliable model for VPN traffic classification while highlighting key performance tradeoffs in feature extraction and preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at SoftCOM 2025</p></details> |

We utilize a video interpolation model to predict the motion, but large frame-to-frame motions can lead to ambiguous interpretations. To overcome this, we employ a hierarchical approach to identify keyframes that are visually close to the input states and show significant motion, then generate smooth fragments between them. For each fragment, we construct the 3D representation of the keyframe using Gaussian Splatting. The temporal frames within the fragment guide the motion, enabling their transformation into dynamic Gaussians through a deformation field. To improve temporal consistency and refine 3D motion, we expand the self-attention of multi-view diffusion across timesteps and apply rigid transformation regularization. Finally, we merge the independently generated 3D motion segments by interpolating boundary deformation fields and optimizing them to align with the guiding video, ensuring smooth and flicker-free transitions. Through extensive qualitative and quantitiave experiments as well as a user study, we show the effectiveness of our method and its components.

| **[Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11693v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-based Deep Learning Model for Joint Routing and Scheduling with Varying Electric Vehicle Numbers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15385v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing integration of renewable energy sources in modern power systems has introduced significant operational challenges due to their intermittent and uncertain outputs. In recent years, mobile energy storage systems (ESSs) have emerged as a popular flexible resource for mitigating these challenges. Compared to stationary ESSs, mobile ESSs offer additional spatial flexibility, enabling cost-effective energy delivery through the transportation network. However, the widespread deployment of mobile ESSs is often hindered by the high investment cost, which has motivated researchers to investigate utilising more readily available alternatives, such as electric vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy storage units instead. Hence, we explore this opportunity with a MIP-based day-ahead electric vehicle joint routing and scheduling problem in this work. However, solving the problem in a practical setting can often be computationally intractable since the existence of binary variables makes it combinatorial challenging. Therefore, we proposed to simplify the problem's solution process for a MIP solver by pruning the solution search space with a transformer-based deep learning (DL) model. This is done by training the model to rapidly predict the optimal binary solutions. In addition, unlike many existing DL approaches that assume fixed problem structures, the proposed model is designed to accommodate problems with EV fleets of any sizes. This flexibility is essential since frequent re-training can introduce significant computational overhead. We evaluated the approach with simulations on the IEEE 33-bus system coupled with the Nguyen-Dupuis transportation network.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting (IAS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Semantics-Guided Diffusion for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding in Wireless Image Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01138v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) offers a promising avenue for enhancing transmission efficiency by jointly incorporating source and channel statistics into the system design. A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Simple Low-bit Quantization Framework for Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21517v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) aims to use a low-speed 2D camera to capture high-speed scene as snapshot compressed measurements, followed by a reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the high-speed video frames. State-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based algorithms have achieved impressive performance, yet with heavy computational workload. Network quantization is a promising way to reduce computational cost. However, a direct low-bit quantization will bring large performance drop. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a simple low-bit quantization framework (dubbed Q-SCI) for the end-to-end deep learning-based video SCI reconstruction methods which usually consist of a feature extraction, feature enhancement, and video reconstruction module. Specifically, we first design a high-quality feature extraction module and a precise video reconstruction module to extract and propagate high-quality features in the low-bit quantized model. In addition, to alleviate the information distortion of the Transformer branch in the quantized feature enhancement module, we introduce a shift operation on the query and key distributions to further bridge the performance gap. Comprehensive experimental results manifest that our Q-SCI framework can achieve superior performance, e.g., 4-bit quantized EfficientSCI-S derived by our Q-SCI framework can theoretically accelerate the real-valued EfficientSCI-S by 7.8X with only 2.3% performance gap on the simulation testing datasets.

| **[StackTrans: From Large Language Model to Large Pushdown Automata Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15343v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the broad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of large language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and the substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still has some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to effectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or deterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs. Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention. Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse tasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and other baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B parameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M outperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters, showcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under development</p></details> |

Existing efficiency efforts typically target either parameter sharing or adaptive computation, leaving open the question of how to attain both simultaneously. We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This allows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still active at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency by selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core mechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the first recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory footprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms a new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it significantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy, while delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive baselines. These gains demonstrate that MoR is an effective path towards large-model quality without incurring large-model cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 9 figures, 14 tables, codes at https://github.com/raymin0223/mixture_of_recursions</p></details> |
| **[CUDA-L1: Improving CUDA Optimization via Contrastive Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14111v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization. CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance. The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deepreinforce-ai.github.io/cudal1_blog/</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Autoencoder Experts Guidance using Unlabeled and Incomplete Data for Exploration in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15287v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in Reinforcement Learning (RL) highlight the need for agents to learn from reward-free interactions and alternative supervision signals, such as unlabeled or incomplete demonstrations, rather than relying solely on explicit reward maximization. Additionally, developing generalist agents that can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors and accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our approach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and dense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete. This provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal data is unavailable and precise reward control is needed.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, accepted for the non-archival workshop "Workshop on Reinforcement Learning Beyond Rewards @ Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025"</p></details> |
| **[Event-Triggered Resilient Consensus of Networked Euler-Lagrange Systems Under Byzantine Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15283v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilient consensus problem is investigated in this paper for a class of networked Euler-Lagrange systems with event-triggered communication in the presence of Byzantine attacks. One challenge that we face in addressing the considered problem is the inapplicability of existing resilient decision algorithms designed for one-dimensional multi-agent systems. This is because the networked Euler-Lagrange systems fall into the category of multi-dimensional multi-agent systems with coupling among state vector components. To address this problem, we propose a new resilient decision algorithm. This algorithm constructs auxiliary variables related to the coordinative objectives for each normal agent, and transforms the considered resilient consensus problem into the consensus problem of the designed auxiliary variables. Furthermore, to relax the constraints imposed on Byzantine agent behavior patterns within continuous-time scenarios, the event-triggered communication scheme is adopted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through case studies.</p></details> | 11 pages, 16 figures |

While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Existing alternatives typically require either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets. Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers (e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences.

However, many existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as assuming sub-Gaussian data or being vulnerable to data contamination. Additionally, some methods are computationally expensive or depend on unknown model parameters that must be estimated, limiting their accessibility for data analysts seeking privacy-preserving PCA. In this paper, we propose a differentially private PCA method applicable to heavy-tailed and potentially contaminated data. Our approach leverages the property that the covariance matrix of properly rescaled data preserves eigenvectors and their order under elliptical distributions, which include Gaussian and heavy-tailed distributions. By applying a bounded transformation, we enable straightforward computation of principal components in a differentially private manner. Additionally, boundedness guarantees robustness against data contamination. We conduct both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations of the proposed method, focusing on its ability to recover the subspace spanned by the leading principal components. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of statistical utility, particularly in non-Gaussian or contaminated data settings.</p></details> | 38 pages, 6 figures |

For machines to achieve human-like intelligence in real-world interactions, understanding these physical properties of objects is essential, forming the foundation for dynamic video prediction. While recent advancements in object-centric transformers have demonstrated potential in video prediction, they primarily focus on object appearance, often overlooking motion dynamics, which is crucial for modeling dynamic interactions and maintaining temporal consistency in complex environments. To address these limitations, we propose OCK, a dynamic video prediction model leveraging object-centric kinematics and object slots. We introduce a novel component named Object Kinematics that comprises explicit object motions, serving as an additional attribute beyond conventional appearance features to model dynamic scenes. The Object Kinematics are integrated into various OCK mechanisms, enabling spatiotemporal prediction of complex object interactions over long video sequences. Our model demonstrates superior performance in handling complex scenes with intricate object attributes and motions, highlighting its potential for applicability in vision-related dynamics learning tasks.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV2025 |

Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://rookiexiong7.github.io/projects/SeC/; code: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC; dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS</p></details> |

This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1400 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ongoi...</summary><p>ongoing work; 166 pages, 1411 citations</p></details> |

Accordingly, tokenizing sensor data efficiently is paramount to ensuring the real-time feasibility of such architectures on embedded hardware. To this end, we present an efficient triplane-based multi-camera tokenization strategy that leverages recent advances in 3D neural reconstruction and rendering to produce sensor tokens that are agnostic to the number of input cameras and their resolution, while explicitly accounting for their geometry around an AV. Experiments on a large-scale AV dataset and state-of-the-art neural simulator demonstrate that our approach yields significant savings over current image patch-based tokenization strategies, producing up to 72% fewer tokens, resulting in up to 50% faster policy inference while achieving the same open-loop motion planning accuracy and improved offroad rates in closed-loop driving simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse. In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures, which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Building on this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference. We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily bound to their underlying model architectures.</p></details> | 3 pages, 1 figure |

To address this challenge, we propose a proactive blockage prediction framework that utilizes multi-modal sensing, including camera, GPS, LiDAR, and radar inputs in an infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) setting. This approach uses modality-specific deep learning models to process each sensor stream independently and fuses their outputs using a softmax-weighted ensemble strategy based on validation performance. Our evaluations, for up to 1.5s in advance, show that the camera-only model achieves the best standalone trade-off with an F1-score of 97.1% and an inference time of 89.8ms. A camera+radar configuration further improves accuracy to 97.2% F1 at 95.7ms.

| **[LAPO: Internalizing Reasoning Efficiency via Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15758v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\% while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub:https://github.com/zju-real/lapo; Project:https://zju-real.github.io/lapo</p></details> |
| **[HER-Seg: Holistically Efficient Segmentation for High-Resolution Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06205v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution segmentation is critical for precise disease diagnosis by extracting fine-grained morphological details. Existing hierarchical encoder-decoder frameworks have demonstrated remarkable adaptability across diverse medical segmentation tasks. While beneficial, they usually require the huge computation and memory cost when handling large-size segmentation, which limits their applications in foundation model building and real-world clinical scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a holistically efficient framework for high-resolution medical image segmentation, called HER-Seg. Specifically, we first devise a computation-efficient image encoder (CE-Encoder) to model long-range dependencies with linear complexity while maintaining sufficient representations. In particular, we introduce the dual-gated linear attention (DLA) mechanism to perform cascaded token filtering, selectively retaining important tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones to enhance attention computation efficiency. Then, we introduce a memory-efficient mask decoder (ME-Decoder) to eliminate the demand for the hierarchical structure by leveraging cross-scale segmentation decoding. Extensive experiments reveal that HER-Seg outperforms state-of-the-arts in high-resolution medical 2D, 3D and video segmentation tasks. In particular, our HER-Seg requires only 0.59GB training GPU memory and 9.39G inference FLOPs per 1024$\times$1024 image, demonstrating superior memory and computation efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/HER-Seg.</p></details> | Under Review |

Existing HRI systems demonstrate great progress in interpreting and following user instructions, action generation, and robot task solving. On the other hand, bi-directional, multi-modal, and context-aware support of the user in collaborative tasks still remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present a gaze- and speech-informed interface to the assistive robot, which is able to perceive the working environment from multiple vision inputs and support the dynamic user in their tasks. Our system is designed to be modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is capable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and fast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple public dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved robustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the performance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted HRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances adaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics but may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for more straightforward tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 34th IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), which will be held in Eindhoven, Netherlands on August 25-29, 2025.

| **[TokensGen: Harnessing Condensed Tokens for Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15728v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips, extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To (Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference, an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips, reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive simulations.

| **[Enhancing Natural Language Inference Performance with Knowledge Graph for COVID-19 Automated Fact-Checking in Indonesian Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00061v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of ICT Research and Applications (JICTRA)</p></details> |

Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and 21.95% compared to SparsePCGC.

For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from reinforcement learning (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for mathematical reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to automatically constructing abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced mathematics problems by developing EFAGen, which operationalizes the task of automatically inferring an EFA for a given seed problem and solution as a program synthesis task. We first formalize the properties of any valid EFA as executable unit tests. Using execution feedback from the unit tests, we search over candidate programs sampled from a LLM to find EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. We then apply the tests as a reward signal, training LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We show that EFAs inferred by EFAGen are faithful to the seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show uses of model-written EFAs e.g., finding harder/easier problem variants, as well as data generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zaidkhan.me/EFAGen/</p></details> |

By integrating high-bandwidth HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA, without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and 1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of fixed memory to compute.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Stage Prompt Inference Attacks on Enterprise LLM Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15613v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place. We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both attacks and defenses.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Brain-Inspired Online Adaptation for Remote Sensing with Spiking Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02146v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device computing, or edge computing, is becoming increasingly important for remote sensing, particularly in applications like deep network-based perception on on-orbit satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In these scenarios, two brain-like capabilities are crucial for remote sensing models: (1) high energy efficiency, allowing the model to operate on edge devices with limited computing resources, and (2) online adaptation, enabling the model to quickly adapt to environmental variations, weather changes, and sensor drift. This work addresses these needs by proposing an online adaptation framework based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for remote sensing. Starting with a pretrained SNN model, we design an efficient, unsupervised online adaptation algorithm, which adopts an approximation of the BPTT algorithm and only involves forward-in-time computation that significantly reduces the computational complexity of SNN adaptation learning. Besides, we propose an adaptive activation scaling scheme to boost online SNN adaptation performance, particularly in low time-steps. Furthermore, for the more challenging remote sensing detection task, we propose a confidence-based instance weighting scheme, which substantially improves adaptation performance in the detection task. To our knowledge, this work is the first to address the online adaptation of SNNs. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets across classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation and domain generalization approaches under varying weather conditions. The proposed method enables energy-efficient and fast online adaptation on edge devices, and has much potential in applications such as remote perception on on-orbit satellites and UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2025</p></details> |

This improves on the previous best bound of $\tilde{O}(nm)$ for weighted graphs and $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2}) $ for unweighted graphs (Gabow 1995) for this problem. The running time of our algorithm is dominated by a logarithmic number of calls to a directed global minimum cut subroutine -- if the running time of the latter problem improves to $m^{1+o(1)}$ (thereby matching the running time of maximum flow), the running time of our arboricity algorithm would improve further to $m^{1+o(1)}$. We also give a new algorithm for computing the entire cut hierarchy -- laminar multiway cuts with minimum cut ratio in recursively defined induced subgraphs -- in $m n^{1+o(1)}$ time. The cut hierarchy yields the ideal edge loads (Thorup 2001) in a fractional spanning tree packing of the graph which, we show, also corresponds to a max-entropy solution in the spanning tree polytope. For the cut hierarchy problem, the previous best bound was $\tilde{O}(n^2 m)$ for weighted graphs and $\tilde{O}(n m^{3/2})$ for unweighted graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>FOCS ...</summary><p>FOCS 2025. 25 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

A common modeling strategy is to introduce crossed random effects within a regression framework. However, this approach often encounters serious computational bottlenecks, particularly for non-Gaussian outcomes. In this paper, we propose a scalable and flexible method that approximates the distribution of each random effect by a discrete distribution, effectively partitioning the random effects into a finite number of representative groups. This approximation allows us to express the model as a multi-way grouped structure, which can be efficiently estimated using a simple and fast iterative algorithm. The proposed method accommodates a wide range of outcome models and remains applicable even in settings with more than two-way cross-classification. We theoretically establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator under general settings of classification levels. Through simulation studies and real data applications, we demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed method in logistic, Poisson, and ordered probit regression models involving cross-classified structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages (main) + 34 pages (supplement)</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v4)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 (poster) |

However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in enhancing video comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module. This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation architecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial resolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks integrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism, and consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with full-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain imaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard UNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while maintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at lower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation.

Most existing approaches rely on implicit 3D representations, which produce overly smooth reconstructions and are time-consuming to generate explicit 3D shapes. While more recent methods directly reconstruct point clouds with diffusion models, the multi-step denoising makes high-resolution reconstruction inefficient. To address these limitations, we propose a transformer-based model to efficiently reconstruct dense 3D point clouds of hand-held objects. Our method follows a coarse-to-fine strategy, first generating a sparse point cloud from the image and progressively refining it into a dense representation using pixel-aligned image features. To enhance reconstruction accuracy, we integrate image features with 3D hand geometry to jointly predict the object point cloud and its pose relative to the hand. Our model is trained end-to-end for optimal performance. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with much faster inference speed, while generalizing well to in-the-wild images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025.

Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow, circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and fluid dynamics.</p></details> | 17 pages |

However, existing transfer learning methods not only overlook the sufficiency principle, but also rely on restrictive single-similarity assumptions (\eg individual or combinatorial similarity), leading to suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we propose a sufficiency-principled transfer learning framework via unified model averaging algorithms, accommodating both individual and combinatorial similarities. Theoretically, we establish the asymptotic/high-probability optimality, enhanced convergence rate and asymptotic normality for multi-source linear regression models with a diverging number of parameters, achieving sufficiency, robustness to negative transfer, privacy protection and feasible statistical inference. Extensive simulations and an empirical data analysis of Beijing housing rental data demonstrate the promising superiority of our framework over conventional alternatives.</p></details> | 36 pages |

Despite this reduction, the massive number of experts in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. In this paper, we study how to address this, by pruning MoEs. Among pruning methodologies, unstructured pruning has been known to achieve the highest performance for a given pruning ratio, compared to structured pruning, since the latter imposes constraints on the sparsification structure. This is intuitive, as the solution space of unstructured pruning subsumes that of structured pruning. However, our counterintuitive finding reveals that expert pruning, a form of structured pruning, can actually precede unstructured pruning to outperform unstructured-only pruning. As existing expert pruning, requiring $O(\frac{k^n}{\sqrt{n}})$ forward passes for $n$ experts, cannot scale for recent MoEs, we propose a scalable alternative with $O(1)$ complexity, yet outperforming the more expensive methods. The key idea is leveraging a latent structure between experts, based on behavior similarity, such that the greedy decision of whether to prune closely captures the joint pruning effect. Ours is highly effective -- for Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art unstructured pruning fails to.

However, prior works face challenges in preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original shape and also adherence to the textual description.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

Automatic coding of the ICD in the medical field has been successful in English but faces challenges when dealing with Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). The first issue lies in the difficulty of extracting disease code-related information from Chinese EMRs, primarily due to the concise writing style and specific internal structure of the EMRs. The second problem is that previous methods have failed to leverage the disease-based multi-axial knowledge and lack of association with the corresponding clinical evidence. This paper introduces a novel framework called MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge with Evidence verification in ICD coding for Chinese EMRs. Initially, we identify candidate codes for the diagnosis and categorize each of them into knowledge under four coding axes.Subsequently, we retrieve corresponding clinical evidence from the comprehensive content of EMRs and filter credible evidence through a scoring model. Finally, to ensure the validity of the candidate code, we propose an inference module based on the masked language modeling strategy. This module verifies that all the axis knowledge associated with the candidate code is supported by evidence and provides recommendations accordingly. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conduct experiments using a large-scale Chinese EMR dataset collected from various hospitals. The experimental results demonstrate that MKE-Coder exhibits significant superiority in the task of automatic ICD coding based on Chinese EMRs. In the practical evaluation of our method within simulated real coding scenarios, it has been demonstrated that our approach significantly aids coders in enhancing both their coding accuracy and speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have decided to withdraw this manuscript in order to allow for further revisions and additional experiments</p></details> |
| **[Semantics-Guided Diffusion for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding in Wireless Image Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01138v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) offers a promising avenue for enhancing transmission efficiency by jointly incorporating source and channel statistics into the system design. A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[DAViD: Data-efficient and Accurate Vision Models from Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15365v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our human-centric synthetic dataset and trained models are available at https://aka.ms/DAViD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Latent Space Synergy: Text-Guided Data Augmentation for Direct Diffusion Biomedical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15361v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation suffers from data scarcity, particularly in polyp detection where annotation requires specialized expertise. We present SynDiff, a framework combining text-guided synthetic data generation with efficient diffusion-based segmentation. Our approach employs latent diffusion models to generate clinically realistic synthetic polyps through text-conditioned inpainting, augmenting limited training data with semantically diverse samples. Unlike traditional diffusion methods requiring iterative denoising, we introduce direct latent estimation enabling single-step inference with T x computational speedup. On CVC-ClinicDB, SynDiff achieves 96.0% Dice and 92.9% IoU while maintaining real-time capability suitable for clinical deployment. The framework demonstrates that controlled synthetic augmentation improves segmentation robustness without distribution shift. SynDiff bridges the gap between data-hungry deep learning models and clinical constraints, offering an efficient solution for deployment in resourcelimited medical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVGMMI Workshop at ICIAP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Listener Scoring Scales: Comparison Learning Framework for Speech Quality Assessment and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13626v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition (CSER) are two key tasks in speech technology, both relying on listener ratings. However, these ratings are inherently biased due to individual listener factors. Previous approaches have introduced a mean listener scoring scale and modeled all listener scoring scales in the training set. However, the mean listener approach is prone to distortion from averaging ordinal data, leading to potential biases. Moreover, learning multiple listener scoring scales while inferring based only on the mean listener scale limits effectiveness. In contrast, our method focuses on modeling a unified listener scoring scale, using comparison scores to correctly capture the scoring relationships between utterances. Experimental results show that our method effectively improves prediction performance in both SQA and CSER tasks, proving its effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Visual Appearance Optimization by Learning from Prior Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15355v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adjusting visual parameters such as brightness and contrast is common in our everyday experiences. Finding the optimal parameter setting is challenging due to the large search space and the lack of an explicit objective function, leaving users to rely solely on their implicit preferences. Prior work has explored Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) to address this challenge, involving users to iteratively select preferred designs from candidate sets. However, PBO often requires many rounds of preference comparisons, making it more suitable for designers than everyday end-users. We propose Meta-PO, a novel method that integrates PBO with meta-learning to improve sample efficiency. Specifically, Meta-PO infers prior users' preferences and stores them as models, which are leveraged to intelligently suggest design candidates for the new users, enabling faster convergence and more personalized results. An experimental evaluation of our method for appearance design tasks on 2D and 3D content showed that participants achieved satisfactory appearance in 5.86 iterations using Meta-PO when participants shared similar goals with a population (e.g., tuning for a ``warm'' look) and in 8 iterations even generalizes across divergent goals (e.g., from ``vintage'', ``warm'', to ``holiday''). Meta-PO makes personalized visual optimization more applicable to end-users through a generalizable, more efficient optimization conditioned on preferences, with the potential to scale interface personalization more broadly.</p></details> | 24 pages, UIST'25 |
| **[Variational Mode-Driven Graph Convolutional Network for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16191v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on spatiotemporal (ST) traffic prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). Given that ST data comprises non-stationary and complex temporal patterns, interpreting and predicting such trends is inherently challenging. Representing ST data in decomposed modes helps infer underlying behavior and assess the impact of noise on predictive performance. We propose a framework that decomposes ST data into interpretable modes using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and processes them through a neural network for future state forecasting. Unlike existing graph-based traffic forecasters that operate directly on raw or aggregated time series, the proposed hybrid approach, termed the Variational Mode Graph Convolutional Network (VMGCN), first decomposes non-stationary signals into interpretable variational modes by determining the optimal mode count via reconstruction-loss minimization and then learns both intramode and cross-mode spatiotemporal dependencies through a novel attention-augmented GCN. Additionally, we analyze the significance of each mode and the effect of bandwidth constraints on multi-horizon traffic flow predictions. The proposed two-stage design yields significant accuracy gains while providing frequency-level interpretability with demonstrated superior performance on the LargeST dataset for both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/OsamaAhmad369/VMGCN.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST) Submission, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Showdown](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15290v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thompson Sampling (TS) is widely used to address the exploration/exploitation tradeoff in contextual bandits, yet recent theory shows that it does not explore aggressively enough in high-dimensional problems. Feel-Good Thompson Sampling (FG-TS) addresses this by adding an optimism bonus that biases toward high-reward models, and it achieves the asymptotically minimax-optimal regret in the linear setting when posteriors are exact. However, its performance with \emph{approximate} posteriors -- common in large-scale or neural problems -- has not been benchmarked. We provide the first systematic study of FG-TS and its smoothed variant (SFG-TS) across eleven real-world and synthetic benchmarks. To evaluate their robustness, we compare performance across settings with exact posteriors (linear and logistic bandits) to approximate regimes produced by fast but coarse stochastic-gradient samplers. Ablations over preconditioning, bonus scale, and prior strength reveal a trade-off: larger bonuses help when posterior samples are accurate, but hurt when sampling noise dominates. FG-TS generally outperforms vanilla TS in linear and logistic bandits, but tends to be weaker in neural bandits. Nevertheless, because FG-TS and its variants are competitive and easy-to-use, we recommend them as baselines in modern contextual-bandit benchmarks. Finally, we provide source code for all our experiments in https://github.com/SarahLiaw/ctx-bandits-mcmc-showdown.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 2 figures, 36 tables</p></details> |
| **[VLM-UDMC: VLM-Enhanced Unified Decision-Making and Motion Control for Urban Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15266v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene understanding and risk-aware attentions are crucial for human drivers to make safe and effective driving decisions. To imitate this cognitive ability in urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and interpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified decision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework incorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow system, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the downstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental changes, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More specifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to process multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating risk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM provides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic participants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon trajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is verified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size autonomous vehicle. It is demonstrated that the presented VLM-UDMC effectively leverages scene understanding and attention decomposition for rational driving decisions, thus improving the overall urban driving performance. Our open-source project is available at https://github.com/henryhcliu/vlmudmc.git.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[CHORDS: Diffusion Sampling Accelerator with Multi-core Hierarchical ODE Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15260v1)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have become dominant generators of high-fidelity images and videos but remain limited by their computationally expensive inference procedures. Existing acceleration techniques either require extensive model retraining or compromise significantly on sample quality. This paper explores a general, training-free, and model-agnostic acceleration strategy via multi-core parallelism. Our framework views multi-core diffusion sampling as an ODE solver pipeline, where slower yet accurate solvers progressively rectify faster solvers through a theoretically justified inter-core communication mechanism. This motivates our multi-core training-free diffusion sampling accelerator, CHORDS, which is compatible with various diffusion samplers, model architectures, and modalities. Through extensive experiments, CHORDS significantly accelerates sampling across diverse large-scale image and video diffusion models, yielding up to 2.1x speedup with four cores, improving by 50% over baselines, and 2.9x speedup with eight cores, all without quality degradation. This advancement enables CHORDS to establish a solid foundation for real-time, high-fidelity diffusion generation.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

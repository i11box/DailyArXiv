| **[VoxHammer: Training-Free Precise and Coherent 3D Editing in Native 3D Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19247v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data foundation for in-context 3D generation.

| **[Articulate3D: Zero-Shot Text-Driven 3D Object Posing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19244v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model, allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh. Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing approaches.

| **[MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

| **[Emergent time-keeping mechanisms in a deep reinforcement learning agent performing an interval timing task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15784v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes and frequencies corresponding to the target interval. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 Artificial Life Conference</p></details> |
| **[Automated Feature Tracking for Real-Time Kinematic Analysis and Shape Estimation of Carbon Nanotube Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19232v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking (VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78, $\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth, lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF ICCV 2025, CV4MS Workshop (Computer Vision for Materials Science), Code available at: https://github.com/kavehsfv/VFTrack</p></details> |
| **[Generative Interfaces for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19227v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots, and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19136v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[From Intents to Conversations: Generating Intent-Driven Dialogues with Contrastive Learning for Multi-Turn Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14252v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In conversational AI systems, a critical challenge in training effective multi-turn intent classification models lies in the generation of large-scale, domain-specific, multilingual dialogue datasets. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Intent, a novel framework that integrates Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intent-driven, context-aware dialogues through self-play. Our method first extracts domain-specific intent transition patterns from real-world e-commerce chat logs, which guide the modeling of turn-level dynamics and intent sequences. LLMs are then employed to parameterize the emission probabilities of HMMs, enabling the generation of natural, coherent utterances aligned with predicted intents and dialogue context. We further propose MINT-CL, a multi-task contrastive learning framework for multi-turn intent classification, which improves performance while reducing dependence on large-scale annotated datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in both dialogue generation quality and classification accuracy, particularly in multilingual settings. To facilitate future research, we release MINT-E, a comprehensive, multilingual, intent-aware multi-turn dialogue corpus derived from the e-commerce domain. The reproduced source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/junhua/chain-of-intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Proceedings of CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space for Data Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19210v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However, collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE (Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\% relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification, where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable addition to existing training pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by APSIPA ASC 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniHuman-1.5: Instilling an Active Mind in Avatars via Cognitive Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19209v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

| **[LSD-3D: Large-Scale 3D Driving Scene Generation with Geometry Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19204v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent 3D generations of complex driving scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://light.princeton.edu/LSD-3D</p></details> |
| **[Demystifying Scientific Problem-Solving in LLMs by Probing Knowledge and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19202v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2) Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline for scientific reasoning.</p></details> | 28 pages, 16 figures |
| **[The Ramon Llull's Thinking Machine for Automated Ideation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19200v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g., efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work - motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward collaborative ideation between humans and AI.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Planning-Query-Guided Model Generation for Model-Based Deformable Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19199v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task, our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Investigating the Robustness of Extreme Precipitation Super-Resolution Across Climates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09166v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coarse spatial resolution of gridded climate models, such as general circulation models, limits their direct use in projecting socially relevant variables like extreme precipitation. Most downscaling methods estimate the conditional distributions of extremes by generating large ensembles, complicating the assessment of robustness under distributional shifts, such as those induced by climate change. To better understand and potentially improve robustness, we propose super-resolving the parameters of the target variable's probability distribution directly using analytically tractable mappings. Within a perfect-model framework over Switzerland, we demonstrate that vector generalized linear and additive models can super-resolve the generalized extreme value distribution of summer hourly precipitation extremes from coarse precipitation fields and topography. We introduce the notion of a "robustness gap", defined as the difference in predictive error between present-trained and future-trained models, and use it to diagnose how model structure affects the generalization of each quantile to a pseudo-global warming scenario. By evaluating multiple model configurations, we also identify an upper limit on the super-resolution factor based on the spatial auto- and cross-correlation of precipitation and elevation, beyond which coarse precipitation loses predictive value. Our framework is broadly applicable to variables governed by parametric distributions and offers a model-agnostic diagnostic for understanding when and why empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.</p></details> | <details><summary>40+3 ...</summary><p>40+3 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, submitted to WCE</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Model Checking for Closed-Loop Robot Reactive Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19186v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents. This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in the context of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages excluding references, 18 figures, submitted to Formal Aspects of Computing</p></details> |
| **[mRAG: Elucidating the Design Space of Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24073v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made remarkable strides in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, visual grounding, and complex reasoning. However, they remain limited by static training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and inability to verify claims against up-to-date, external evidence, compromising their performance in dynamic real-world applications. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a practical solution to mitigate these challenges by allowing the LVLMs to access large-scale knowledge databases via retrieval mechanisms, thereby grounding model outputs in factual, contextually relevant information. Here in this paper, we conduct the first systematic dissection of the multimodal RAG pipeline for LVLMs, explicitly investigating (1) the retrieval phase: on the modality configurations and retrieval strategies, (2) the re-ranking stage: on strategies to mitigate positional biases and improve the relevance of retrieved evidence, and (3) the generation phase: we further investigate how to best integrate retrieved candidates into the final generation process. Finally, we extend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and generation through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence and suppress irrelevant context dynamically. Our full-stack exploration of RAG for LVLMs yields substantial insights, resulting in an average performance boost of 5% without any fine-tuning.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach, which relies on large-scale datasets, often overlooks task-specific characteristics in tool use, leading to performance bottlenecks. To address this issue, we analyze three existing LLMs and uncover key insights: training data can inadvertently impede tool-use behavior, token importance is distributed unevenly, and errors in tool calls fall into a small set of categories. Building on these findings, we propose~\emph{TL-Training}, a task-feature-based framework that mitigates the effects of suboptimal training data, dynamically adjusts token weights to prioritize key tokens during SFT, and incorporates a robust reward mechanism tailored to error categories, optimized through proximal policy optimization. We validate TL-Training by training CodeLLaMA-2-7B and evaluating it on four open-source test sets. Our results demonstrate that the LLM trained by our method matches or surpasses both open- and closed-source LLMs in tool-use performance using only 1,217 training data points. Additionally, our method enhances robustness in noisy environments and improves general task performance, offering a scalable and efficient paradigm for tool-use training in LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/TL-Training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[MDD: a Mask Diffusion Detector to Protect Speaker Verification Systems from Adversarial Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19180v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speaker verification systems are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. In this work, we propose the Mask Diffusion Detector (MDD), a novel adversarial detection and purification framework based on a \textit{text-conditioned masked diffusion model}. During training, MDD applies partial masking to Mel-spectrograms and progressively adds noise through a forward diffusion process, simulating the degradation of clean speech features. A reverse process then reconstructs the clean representation conditioned on the input transcription. Unlike prior approaches, MDD does not require adversarial examples or large-scale pretraining. Experimental results show that MDD achieves strong adversarial detection performance and outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, including both diffusion-based and neural codec-based approaches. Furthermore, MDD effectively purifies adversarially-manipulated speech, restoring speaker verification performance to levels close to those observed under clean conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based masking strategies for secure and reliable speaker verification systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by APSIPA ASC 2025</p></details> |
| **[MonoCoP: Chain-of-Prediction for Monocular 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04594v5)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting 3D attributes is crucial for monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D), with depth estimation posing the greatest challenge due to the inherent ambiguity in mapping 2D images to 3D space. While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>I pla...</summary><p>I plan to re-format and re-write this paper</p></details> |

Learning such behaviors directly on physical hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints. Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings. We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios. Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic systems.

| **[Direction Informed Trees (DIT*): Optimal Path Planning via Direction Filter and Direction Cost Heuristic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19168v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal path planning requires finding a series of feasible states from the starting point to the goal to optimize objectives. Popular path planning algorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to guide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally efficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting nature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based planner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge, resulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized vectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that selects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated direction cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows the exploration to share directional information efficiently. DIT* convergence faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on tested problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments with various planning tasks.

Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods. Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE), which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries. Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 10 pages |

This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation of clinical dialogue agents. MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference study. Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios and 10 clinical domains. MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured scenarios, and datasets.</p></details> | 36 pages, 16 figures |

However, automating this process with deep learning models is challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200% increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/RafaelSterzinger/acpr_few_shot_hist.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, accepted at ACPR2025</p></details> |

We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14pag...</summary><p>14pages, 9 figures, Journal paper</p></details> |
| **[Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but often overlooked dimension of intelligence. This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions, we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics. The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive entertainment. Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD D...</summary><p>PhD Dissertation, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 2025.

We study a DAM built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis, we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable. Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.</p></details> | 55 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Algorithmic Collective Action with Multiple Collectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19149v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design. Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals, i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives' sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with multiple collectives.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Gaussian process emulators are statistical surrogates that can rapidly approximate the outputs of computer models at untested inputs and enable uncertainty quantification studies. The parallel partial emulation (PPE) was developed to model simulators with vector-valued outputs. While the PPE is adept at fitting simulator data with multidimensional outputs, the time to fit the PPE increases quickly as the number of training runs increases. The Scaled Vecchia approximation, a fast approximation to multivariate Gaussian likelihoods, makes fitting Gaussian process emulators with large training datasets tractable. Here we introduce the Vecchia Parallel Partial Emulation (VPPE) that utilizes the Scaled Vecchia approximation within the PPE framework to allow for parallel partial emulation with larger training datasets. The VPPE is applied to three computer experiments, a synthetic data set, a hydrology model, and a volcanic flow model, yielding comparable predictive accuracy to the PPE at a fraction of the runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>R cod...</summary><p>R code available at https://github.com/SideofMan/VPPE</p></details> |

However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g., close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight image quality improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fhahlbohm.github.io/inpc_v2/</p></details> |

However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling, resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks. To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model, we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2025</p></details> |

| **[Beyond the Black Box: Integrating Lexical and Semantic Methods in Quantitative Discourse Analysis with BERTopic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19099v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of Large Language Models and computational tools. However, reliance on black box software such as MAXQDA and NVivo risks undermining methodological transparency and alignment with research goals. This paper presents a hybrid, transparent framework for QDA that combines lexical and semantic methods to enable triangulation, reproducibility, and interpretability. Drawing from a case study in historical political discourse, we demonstrate how custom Python pipelines using NLTK, spaCy, and Sentence Transformers allow fine-grained control over preprocessing, lemmatisation, and embedding generation. We further detail our iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological triangulation in computational discourse studies.

We demonstrate the accuracy of this method through a variety of examples, including the Gaussian function, probability density functions of the lognormal and Gompertz-Makeham distributions, the hockey stick and unit step functions, as well as a function arising in the approximation of the gamma and Barnes $G$-functions.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

The analysis reveals that AI technologies are reshaping democratic processes in fundamental ways: enabling mass-scale deliberation, changing how citizens access and engage with political information, and transforming how representatives make and implement decisions. While AI offers unprecedented opportunities for enhancing democratic participation and governance efficiency, it also presents significant challenges to democratic legitimacy and accountability. Social media platforms' AI-driven algorithms currently mediate much political discourse, creating concerns about information manipulation and privacy. Large Language Models introduce both epistemic challenges and potential tools for improving democratic dialogue. The emergence of Mass Online Deliberation platforms suggests possibilities for scaling up meaningful citizen participation, while Algorithmic Decision-Making systems promise more efficient policy implementation but face limitations in handling complex political trade-offs. As these systems become prevalent, representatives may assume the role of architects of automated decision frameworks, responsible for guiding the translation of politically contested concepts into technical parameters and metrics. Advanced deliberation platforms offering real-time insights into citizen preferences will challenge traditional representative independence and discretion to interpret public will. The institutional integration of these participation mechanisms requires frameworks that balance the benefits with democratic stability through hybrid systems weighting different forms of democratic expression.</p></details> | 13 pages |

An empirical study of asset pricing in pretrained RNN sparse and global attention models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19006v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420 large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML) based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research. All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80 respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages including appendix, 21 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

The majority of current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low, leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network, named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module (EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition, we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss to constrain the network training.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

It achieves excellent compression performance on screen content images in RGB 4:4:4 format with few distinct colors. In contrast to many other lossless compression methods, it codes entire color pixels at once, i.e., all color components of one pixel are coded together. Consequently, it does not natively support image formats with downsampled chroma, such as YCbCr 4:2:0, which is an often used chroma format in video compression. In this paper, we extend the soft context formation coding capabilities to 4:2:0 image compression, by successively coding Y and CbCr planes based on an analysis of normalized mutual information between image planes. Additionally, we propose an enhancement to the chroma prediction based on the luminance plane. Furthermore, we propose to transmit side-information about occurring luma-chroma combinations to improve chroma probability distribution modelling. Averaged over a large screen content image dataset, our proposed method outperforms HEVC-SCC, with HEVC-SCC needing 5.66% more bitrate compared to our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding, pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning.

However, their real-world application in SOCs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present a longitudinal study of 3,090 analyst queries from 45 SOC analysts over 10 months. Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for sensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes determinations, preserving analyst decision authority. The majority of queries are related to interpreting low-level telemetry (e.g., commands) and refining technical communication through short (1-3 turn) interactions. Notably, 93% of queries align with established cybersecurity competencies (NICE Framework), underscoring the relevance of LLM use for SOC-related tasks. Despite variations in tasks and engagement, usage trends indicate a shift from occasional exploration to routine integration, with growing adoption and sustained use among a subset of analysts. We find that LLMs function as flexible, on-demand cognitive aids that augment, rather than replace, SOC expertise. Our study provides actionable guidance for designing context-aware, human-centred AI assistance in security operations, highlighting the need for further in-the-wild research on real-world analyst-LLM collaboration, challenges, and impacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[Forecasting Probability Distributions of Financial Returns with Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18921v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study evaluates deep neural networks for forecasting probability distributions of financial returns. 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures are used to forecast parameters of three probability distributions: Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t. Using custom negative log-likelihood loss functions, distribution parameters are optimized directly. The models are tested on six major equity indices (S\&P 500, BOVESPA, DAX, WIG, Nikkei 225, and KOSPI) using probabilistic evaluation metrics including Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT). Results show that deep learning models provide accurate distributional forecasts and perform competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. The LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performs best across multiple evaluation criteria, capturing both heavy tails and asymmetry in financial returns.

| **[Generative Artificial Intelligence and Agents in Research and Teaching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16701v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the development, functioning, and application of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on their implications for research and education. It traces the conceptual evolution from artificial intelligence (AI) through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) to transformer architectures, which constitute the foundation of contemporary generative systems. Technical aspects, including prompting strategies, word embeddings, and probabilistic sampling methods (temperature, top-k, and top-p), are examined alongside the emergence of autonomous agents. These elements are considered in relation to both the opportunities they create and the limitations and risks they entail. The work critically evaluates the integration of GenAI across the research process, from ideation and literature review to research design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. While particular attention is given to geographical research, the discussion extends to wider academic contexts. A parallel strand addresses the pedagogical applications of GenAI, encompassing course and lesson design, teaching delivery, assessment, and feedback, with geography education serving as a case example. Central to the analysis are the ethical, social, and environmental challenges posed by GenAI. Issues of bias, intellectual property, governance, and accountability are assessed, alongside the ecological footprint of LLMs and emerging technological strategies for mitigation. The concluding section considers near- and long-term futures of GenAI, including scenarios of sustained adoption, regulation, and potential decline. By situating GenAI within both scholarly practice and educational contexts, the study contributes to critical debates on its transformative potential and societal responsibilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>113 p...</summary><p>113 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables, 2 appendices</p></details> |
| **[HAEPO: History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18884v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs). Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous (reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.</p></details> | Under review |

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner, leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed, which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

Revisiting Long-CoT Compression with Capability in Mind for Better Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14582v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning improves accuracy in LLMs, yet its verbose, self-reflective style often hinders effective distillation into small language models (SLMs). We revisit Long-CoT compression through the lens of capability alignment and ask: Can pruning improve reasoning? We propose Prune-on-Logic, a structure-aware framework that transforms Long-CoT into logic graphs and selectively prunes low-utility reasoning steps under self-verification constraints. Through systematic analysis across three pruning strategies - targeting entire chains, core reasoning, and verification - we find that verification pruning consistently improves accuracy while reducing token usage, whereas reasoning or indiscriminate pruning degrades performance. Our study reveals that effective pruning aligns supervision with model capacity rather than merely shortening inputs. Gains hold across tasks, model scales, and CoT capability, with larger models benefiting more from pruning due to richer but more redundant reasoning. Our empirical findings highlight pruning as a structural optimization strategy for aligning CoT reasoning with SLM capacity.</p></details> | 19 pages,6 figures |

In this work, we advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy. Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions.

However, existing 2.5D-based models primarily adopt a single encoder to extract features of target and neighborhood slices, failing to effectively fuse inter-slice information, resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. In this study, a novel momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer (MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice information from multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders. Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain consistent slice representations. Moreover, an inter-slice fusion transformer (IF-Trans) module is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features. MOSformer is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and AMOS), achieving a new state-of-the-art with 85.63%, 92.19%, and 85.43% DSC, respectively. These results demonstrate MOSformer's competitiveness in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables. Under Review</p></details> |

Rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>DSTC1...</summary><p>DSTC12@SigDial2025; data and code available at https://github.com/amazon-science/dstc12-controllable-conversational-theme-detection</p></details> |

However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at https://github.com/hyebin-c/FaceMat.git</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025. 9 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy, maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 tables, and 5 figures</p></details> |

Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus.

Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Built on top of generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However, they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD'2025 Agent4IR workshop</p></details> |

High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC (MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability. Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers, bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates $\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction, achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection. Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and -100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve 98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, was presented at the 9th International Conference 'Deep Learning on Computational Physics (DLCP2025)', and is currently under review for the Moscow University Physics Bulletin, Physics series</p></details> |

In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding (PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly, which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject, thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework, PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPI-INF-3DHP, and Human3.6M datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach.

These rules are derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84% inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.

However, building analogous models for human mobility remains challenging due to the privacy-sensitive nature of mobility data and the resulting data silos across institutions. To bridge this gap, we propose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training mobility foundation models via generative continual learning. Without sharing raw data, MoveGCL enables decentralized and progressive model evolution by replaying synthetic trajectories generated from a frozen teacher model, and reinforces knowledge retention through a tailored distillation strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. To address the heterogeneity of mobility patterns, MoveGCL incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts Transformer with a mobility-aware expert routing mechanism, and employs a layer-wise progressive adaptation strategy to stabilize continual updates. Experiments on six real-world urban datasets demonstrate that MoveGCL achieves performance comparable to joint training and significantly outperforms federated learning baselines, while offering strong privacy protection. MoveGCL marks a crucial step toward unlocking foundation models for mobility, offering a practical blueprint for open, scalable, and privacy-preserving model development in the era of foundation models.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap. Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss. Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant, and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Second AI for Math Workshop at ICML</p></details> |

However, spatial domain SNR priors have two limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference, and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT) bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB, EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and 0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in underwater scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PRICAI2025</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark.

Previous methods typically adopt deep learning-based models, focusing on extracting view-invariant features. However, they usually overlook the semantic information in person attributes. In addition, existing training strategies often rely on full fine-tuning large-scale models, which significantly increases training costs. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework named LATex for AG-ReID, which adopts prompt-tuning strategies to leverage attribute-based text knowledge. More specifically, we first introduce the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model as the backbone, and propose an Attribute-aware Image Encoder (AIE) to extract both global semantic features and attribute-aware features from input images. Then, with these features, we propose a Prompted Attribute Classifier Group (PACG) to predict person attributes and obtain attribute representations. Finally, we design a Coupled Prompt Template (CPT) to transform attribute representations and view information into structured sentences. These sentences are processed by the text encoder of CLIP to generate more discriminative features. As a result, our framework can fully leverage attribute-based text knowledge to improve AG-ReID performance. Extensive experiments on three AG-ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

| **[Decidability of Extensions of Presburger Arithmetic by Hardy Field Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19206v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the extension of Presburger arithmetic by the class of sub-polynomial Hardy field functions, and show the majority of these extensions to be undecidable. More precisely, we show that the theory $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}; <, +, \lfloor f \rceil)$, where $f$ is a Hardy field function and $\lfloor \cdot \rceil$ the nearest integer operator, is undecidable when $f$ grows polynomially faster than $x$. Further, we show that when $f$ grows sub-linearly quickly, but still as fast as some polynomial, the theory $\mathrm{Th}(\mathbb{Z}; <, +, \lfloor f \rceil)$ is undecidable.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://pixie-3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[VPPE: Application of Scaled Vecchia Approximations to Parallel Partial Emulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19144v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer models or simulators are widely used across scientific fields, but are computationally expensive limiting their use to explore possible scenarios/outcomes. Gaussian process emulators are statistical surrogates that can rapidly approximate the outputs of computer models at untested inputs and enable uncertainty quantification studies. The parallel partial emulation (PPE) was developed to model simulators with vector-valued outputs. While the PPE is adept at fitting simulator data with multidimensional outputs, the time to fit the PPE increases quickly as the number of training runs increases. The Scaled Vecchia approximation, a fast approximation to multivariate Gaussian likelihoods, makes fitting Gaussian process emulators with large training datasets tractable. Here we introduce the Vecchia Parallel Partial Emulation (VPPE) that utilizes the Scaled Vecchia approximation within the PPE framework to allow for parallel partial emulation with larger training datasets. The VPPE is applied to three computer experiments, a synthetic data set, a hydrology model, and a volcanic flow model, yielding comparable predictive accuracy to the PPE at a fraction of the runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>R cod...</summary><p>R code available at https://github.com/SideofMan/VPPE</p></details> |
| **[A Bag of Tricks for Efficient Implicit Neural Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19140v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis. However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g., close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight image quality improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://fhahlbohm.github.io/inpc_v2/</p></details> |

These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable, multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires $143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems. Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

We assume that the follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives, is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025); Paper ID: M2635, Added more experiments in the Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Steerable Scene Generation with Post Training and Inference-Time Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04831v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robots in simulation requires diverse 3D scenes that reflect the specific challenges of downstream tasks. However, scenes that satisfy strict task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

| **[APT-LLM: Exploiting Arbitrary-Precision Tensor Core Computing for LLM Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19087v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however, attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM. Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication (MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800, APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup over CUTLASS integer baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD)</p></details> |
| **[Can Structured Templates Facilitate LLMs in Tackling Harder Tasks? : An Exploration of Scaling Laws by Difficulty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19069v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction, while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[No Label Left Behind: A Unified Surface Defect Detection Model for all Supervision Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19060v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability. Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial applications.

Illustration on a stochastic multi-population neural mass model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15787v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we propose an adapted sequential Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation (SMC-ABC) algorithm for network inference in coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used for multivariate time series modeling. Our approach is motivated by neuroscience, specifically the challenge of estimating brain connectivity before and during epileptic seizures. To this end, we make four key contributions. First, we introduce a 6N-dimensional SDE to model the activity of N coupled neuronal populations, extending the (single-population) stochastic Jansen and Rit neural mass model used to describe human electroencephalography (EEG) rhythms, particularly epileptic activity. Second, we construct a reliable and efficient numerical splitting scheme for the model simulation. Third, we apply the proposed adapted SMC-ABC algorithm to the neural mass model and validate it on different types of simulated data. Compared to standard SMC-ABC, our approach significantly reduces computational cost by requiring fewer model simulations to reach the desired posterior region, thanks to the inclusion of binary parameters describing the presence or absence of coupling directions. Finally, we apply our method to real multi-channel EEG data, uncovering potential similarities in patients' brain activities across different epileptic seizures, as well as differences between pre-seizure and seizure periods.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Project-Probe-Aggregate: Efficient Fine-Tuning for Group Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09487v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image-text foundation models have succeeded across diverse downstream tasks, they still face challenges in the presence of spurious correlations between the input and label. To address this issue, we propose a simple three-step approach,Project-Probe-Aggregate (PPA), that enables parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundation models without relying on group annotations. Building upon the failure-based debiasing scheme, our method, PPA, improves its two key components: minority samples identification and the robust training algorithm. Specifically, we first train biased classifiers by projecting image features onto the nullspace of class proxies from text encoders. Next, we infer group labels using the biased classifier and probe group targets with prior correction. Finally, we aggregate group weights of each class to produce the debiased classifier. Our theoretical analysis shows that our PPA enhances minority group identification and is Bayes optimal for minimizing the balanced group error, mitigating spurious correlations. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our PPA: it outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average worst-group accuracy while requiring less than 0.01% tunable parameters without training group labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Seal Your Backdoor with Variational Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08829v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose VIBE, a model-agnostic framework that trains classifiers resilient to backdoor attacks. The key concept behind our approach is to treat malicious inputs and corrupted labels from the training dataset as observed random variables, while the actual clean labels are latent. VIBE then recovers the corresponding latent clean label posterior through variational inference. The resulting training procedure follows the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step infers the clean pseudolabels by solving an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, while the M-step updates the classifier parameters via gradient descent. Being modular, VIBE can seamlessly integrate with recent advancements in self-supervised representation learning, which enhance its ability to resist backdoor attacks. We experimentally validate the method effectiveness against contemporary backdoor attacks on standard datasets, a large-scale setup with 1$k$ classes, and a dataset poisoned with multiple attacks. VIBE consistently outperforms previous defenses across all tested scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Estimating the average treatment effect in cluster-randomized trials with misclassified outcomes and non-random validation subsets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18137v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized trials are viewed as the benchmark for assessing causal effects of treatments on outcomes of interest. Nonetheless, challenges such as measurement error can undermine the standard causal assumptions for randomized trials. In ASPIRE, a cluster-randomized trial, pediatric primary care clinics were assigned to one of two treatments aimed at promoting clinician delivery of a secure firearm program to parents during well-child visits. A key outcome of interest is thus parent receipt of the program at each visit. Clinicians documented program delivery in patients' electronic health records for all visits, but their reporting is a proxy measure for the parent receipt outcome. Parents were also surveyed to report directly on program receipt after their child's visit; however, only a small subset of them completed the survey. Here, we develop a causal inference framework for a binary outcome that is subject to misclassification through silver-standard measures (clinician reports), but gold-standard measures (parent reports) are only available for a non-random internal validation subset. We propose a method for identifying the average treatment effect (ATE) that addresses the risk of bias due to misclassification and non-random validation selection, even when the outcome (parent receipt) may directly impact selection propensity (survey responsiveness). We show that ATE estimation relies on specifying the relationship between the gold- and silver-standard outcome measures in the validation subset, which may depend on treatment and covariates. Additionally, the clustered design is reflected in our causal assumptions and in our cluster-robust approach to estimation of the ATE. Simulation studies demonstrate acceptable finite-sample operating characteristics of our ATE estimator, supporting its application to ASPIRE.</p></details> | <details><summary>corre...</summary><p>corrected very minor typos in tables/figs and one small change to abstract</p></details> |

Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts. We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels. Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy protection by thinking adversarially.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables.

In the CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1% and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%, while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA) transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup, positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available on Github.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Novel Approaches to Artificial Intelligence Development Based on the Nearest Neighbor Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18953v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Energy-Based Flow Matching for Generating 3D Molecular Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18949v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to \textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar computational budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning (2025)</p></details> |

The large number of EVs facilitates the development of the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which realizes bidirectional energy exchanges between EVs and the power grid. This has led to the setting up of electricity markets that are usually confined to a small geographical location, often with a small number of participants. Usually, these markets are manipulated by intermediaries responsible for collecting bids from prosumers, determining the market-clearing price, incorporating grid constraints, and accounting for network losses. While centralized models can be highly efficient, they grant excessive power to the intermediary by allowing them to gain exclusive access to prosumers \textquotesingle price preferences. This opens the door to potential market manipulation and raises significant privacy concerns for users, such as the location of energy providers. This lack of protection exposes users to potential risks, as untrustworthy servers and malicious adversaries can exploit this information to infer trading activities and real identities. This work proposes a secure, decentralized exchange market built on blockchain technology, utilizing a privacy-preserving Automated Market Maker (AMM) model to offer open and fair, and equal access to traders, and mitigates the most common trading-manipulation attacks. Additionally, it incorporates a scalable architecture based on geographical dynamic sharding, allowing for efficient resource allocation and improved performance as the market grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm, Paper accepted in 27th MSWiM Conference</p></details> |

However, with sparse input views, the lack of multi-view consistency constraints results in poorly initialized Gaussians and unreliable heuristics for optimization, leading to suboptimal performance. Existing methods often incorporate depth priors from dense estimation networks but overlook the inherent multi-view consistency in input images. Additionally, they rely on dense initialization, which limits the efficiency of scene representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a view synthesis framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, named MCGS, enabling photorealistic scene reconstruction from sparse views. The key innovations of MCGS in enhancing multi-view consistency are as follows: i) We leverage matching priors from a sparse matcher to initialize Gaussians primarily on textured regions, while low-texture areas are populated with randomly distributed Gaussians. This yields a compact yet sufficient set of initial Gaussians. ii) We propose a multi-view consistency-guided progressive pruning strategy to dynamically eliminate inconsistent Gaussians. This approach confines their optimization to a consistency-constrained space, which ensures robust and coherent scene reconstruction. These strategies enhance robustness to sparse views, accelerate rendering, and reduce memory consumption, making MCGS a practical framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[HAEPO: History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18884v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs). Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous (reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.</p></details> | Under review |

However, previous methods often fail to counteract particular regions related to dynamic objects with more severe environmental changes. To mitigate this issue, we propose to incorporate an auxiliary point-selective network into a meta-learning framework, called PointFix, to provide a robust initialization of stereo models for online stereo adaptation. In a nutshell, our auxiliary network learns to fix local variants intensively by effectively back-propagating local information through the meta-gradient for the robust initialization of the baseline model. This network is model-agnostic, so can be used in any kind of architectures in a plug-and-play manner. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method under three adaptation settings such as short-, mid-, and long-term sequences. Experimental results show that the proper initialization of the base stereo model by the auxiliary network enables our learning paradigm to achieve state-of-the-art performance at inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2022</p></details> |
| **[Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Token Redundancy Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20282v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) aims to transfer pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks by learning a small number of parameters. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, which updates the entire model, PET significantly reduces storage and transfer costs for each task regardless of exponentially increasing pre-trained model capacity. However, most PET methods inherit the inference latency of their large backbone models and often introduce additional computational overhead due to additional modules (e.g. adapters), limiting their practicality for compute-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning (FPET), a novel approach that enhances inference speed and training efficiency while maintaining high storage efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play token redundancy reduction module delicately designed for PET. This module refines tokens from the self-attention layer using an adapter to learn the accurate similarity between tokens and cuts off the tokens through a fully-differentiable token merging strategy, which uses a straight-through estimator for optimal token reduction. Experimental results prove that our FPET achieves faster inference and higher memory efficiency than the pre-trained backbone while keeping competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art PET methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18751v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However, the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP), which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2025</p></details> |

We introduce Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[Realizing Reduced and Sparse Biochemical Reaction Networks from Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18096v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a direct optimization framework for learning reduced and sparse chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from time-series trajectory data. In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE CDC 2025.

| **[E-Values for Exponential Families: the General Case](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11134v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze common types of e-variables and e-processes for composite exponential family nulls: the optimal e-variable based on the reverse information projection (RIPr), the conditional (COND) e-variable, and the universal inference (UI) and sequen\-tialized RIPr e-processes. We characterize the RIPr prior for simple and Bayes-mixture based alternatives, either precisely (for Gaussian nulls and alternatives) or in an approximate sense (general exponential families). We provide conditions under which the RIPr e-variable is (again exactly vs. approximately) equal to the COND e-variable. Based on these and other interrelations which we establish, we determine the e-power of the four e-statistics as a function of sample size, exactly for Gaussian and up to $o(1)$ in general. For $d$-dimensional null and alternative, the e-power of UI tends to be smaller by a term of $(d/2) \log n + O(1)$ than that of the COND e-variable, which is the clear winner.</p></details> | 50 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18698v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Novel Deep Hybrid Framework with Ensemble-Based Feature Optimization for Robust Real-Time Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18695v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies, sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges, including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA) is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination, demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 25 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Joint Time-Position Statistics and Fisher Information in Drift-Diffusion Molecular Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18680v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter presents a closed-form characterization of the joint distribution of first arrival time (FAT) and first arrival position (FAP) in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems with drift. Prior studies have investigated FAT modeling via inverse Gaussian distributions [1] and applied FAT statistics for parameter estimation and synchronization tasks [2], [3], while more recent work has characterized FAP for spatial channel analysis [4]. In contrast, we derive an explicit joint probability density function (PDF) under constant drift and isotropic diffusion in arbitrary spatial dimensions. Our result reveals a nontrivial coupling between arrival time and lateral position, generalizing known inverse Gaussian models. We further compute the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to key channel parameters, showing that the joint observation enables estimation of lateral drift and improves sensitivity to the diffusion coefficient -- capabilities not achievable with time-only or position-only models. This joint framework enhances the modeling and inference capabilities for molecular communication channels where spatial randomness itself carries non-negligible information.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Auditing Approximate Machine Unlearning for Differentially Private Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18671v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However, recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples' privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA, utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning algorithms.

| **[Multi-timescale time encoding for CNN prediction of Fenna-Matthews-Olson energy-transfer dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17430v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning simulations of open quantum dynamics often rely on recursive predictors that accumulate error. We develop a non-recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that maps system parameters and a redundant time encoding directly to excitation-energy-transfer populations in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The encoding-modified logistic plus $\tanh$ functions-normalizes time and resolves fast, transitional, and quasi-steady regimes, while physics-informed labels enforce population conservation and inter-site consistency. Trained only on $0\sim 7 ps$ reference trajectories generated with a Lindblad model in QuTiP, the network accurately predicts $0\sim100 ps$ dynamics across a range of reorganization energies, bath rates, and temperatures. Beyond $20 ps$, the absolute relative error remains below 0.05, demonstrating stable long-time extrapolation. By avoiding step-by-step recursion, the method suppresses error accumulation and generalizes across timescales. These results show that redundant time encoding enables data-efficient inference of long-time quantum dissipative dynamics in realistic pigment-protein complexes, and may aid the data-driven design of light-harvesting materials.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5figures |
| **[SFormer: SNR-guided Transformer for Underwater Image Enhancement from the Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18664v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks, particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference, and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT) bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB, EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and 0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in underwater scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PRICAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Retrieval Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16313v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors, particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for enhancing multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model-Based Framework for Explainable Cyberattack Detection in Automatic Generation Control Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22239v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.</p></details> | Accepted Paper |
| **[Agentic AI for Software: thoughts from Software Engineering community](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17343v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt. At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team. Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents. Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Our framework features a unified trajectory representation that encapsulates the kinematic models of both $SO(3)\times\mathbb{R}^3$ and $SE(3)$ pose representations. This encapsulation strategy allows users to use the same implementation of measurement-based factors for either choice of pose representation, which facilitates experimentation and comparison to achieve the best model for the ME task. In addition, unique to our framework, we derive the kinematic models with the closed-form temporal derivatives of the local variable of $SO(3)$ and $SE(3)$, which so far has only been approximated based on the Taylor expansion in the literature. Our experiments show that these kinematic models can improve the estimation accuracy in high-speed scenarios. All analytical Jacobians of the interpolated states with respect to the support states of the trajectory representation, as well as the motion prior factors, are also provided for accelerated Gauss-Newton (GN) optimization. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the framework in various motion estimation tasks such as localization, calibration, and odometry, facilitating fast prototyping for ME researchers. We release the source code for the benefit of the community.

| **[KnowTrace: Bootstrapping Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Structured Knowledge Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20245v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) furnish large language models (LLMs) with iterative retrievals of relevant information to handle complex multi-hop questions. These methods typically alternate between LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces, with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies the gains.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[On Path to Multimodal Historical Reasoning: HistBench and HistAgent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20246v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progress across domains, yet their capabilities in the humanities, particularly history, remain underexplored. Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

The main challenges from these approaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and implementation efforts required from human experts. Recently, significant progress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large language models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined generalized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and guided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori information on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP and CVRP). Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield impressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still require considerable manual interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic design methods to operate without the need of GAFs. More specifically, RedAHD employs LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP at hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based heuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving the transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our experimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of designing heuristics with competitive or improved results over the state-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Efficient Speech Translation through Model Compression and Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20237v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient deployment of large audio-language models for speech translation remains challenging due to their significant computational requirements. In this paper, we address this challenge through our system submissions to the "Model Compression" track at the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2025). We experiment with a combination of approaches including iterative layer pruning based on layer importance evaluation, low-rank adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), and knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we use Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct for speech translation into German and Chinese. Our pruned (student) models achieve up to a 50% reduction in both model parameters and storage footprint, while retaining 97-100% of the translation quality of the in-domain (teacher) models.</p></details> | IWSLT 2025 |
| **[Multimodal Federated Learning With Missing Modalities through Feature Imputation Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20232v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal federated learning holds immense potential for collaboratively training models from multiple sources without sharing raw data, addressing both data scarcity and privacy concerns, two key challenges in healthcare. A major challenge in training multimodal federated models in healthcare is the presence of missing modalities due to multiple reasons, including variations in clinical practice, cost and accessibility constraints, retrospective data collection, privacy concerns, and occasional technical or human errors. Previous methods typically rely on publicly available real datasets or synthetic data to compensate for missing modalities. However, obtaining real datasets for every disease is impractical, and training generative models to synthesize missing modalities is computationally expensive and prone to errors due to the high dimensionality of medical data. In this paper, we propose a novel, lightweight, low-dimensional feature translator to reconstruct bottleneck features of the missing modalities. Our experiments on three different datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH Open-I, and CheXpert), in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings consistently improve the performance of competitive baselines. The code and implementation details are available at: https://github.com/bhattarailab/FedFeatGen</p></details> | MIUA 2025 |
| **[Towards the Automated Extraction and Refactoring of NoSQL Schemas from Application Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20230v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a static code analysis strategy to extract logical schemas from NoSQL applications. Our solution is based on a model-driven reverse engineering process composed of a chain of platform-independent model transformations. The extracted schema conforms to the \uschema{} unified metamodel, which can represent both NoSQL and relational schemas. To support this process, we define a metamodel capable of representing the core elements of object-oriented languages. Application code is first injected into a code model, from which a control flow model is derived. This, in turn, enables the generation of a model representing both data access operations and the structure of stored data. From these models, the \uschema{} logical schema is inferred. Additionally, the extracted information can be used to identify refactoring opportunities. We illustrate this capability through the detection of join-like query patterns and the automated application of field duplication strategies to eliminate expensive joins. All stages of the process are described in detail, and the approach is validated through a round-trip experiment in which a application using a MongoDB store is automatically generated from a predefined schema. The inferred schema is then compared to the original to assess the accuracy of the extraction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal Systems and Software, 23 pages</p></details> |
| **[From What to How: Attributing CLIP's Latent Components Reveals Unexpected Semantic Reliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20229v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based CLIP models are widely used for text-image probing and feature extraction, making it relevant to understand the internal mechanisms behind their predictions. While recent works show that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) yield interpretable latent components, they focus on what these encode and miss how they drive predictions. We introduce a scalable framework that reveals what latent components activate for, how they align with expected semantics, and how important they are to predictions. To achieve this, we adapt attribution patching for instance-wise component attributions in CLIP and highlight key faithfulness limitations of the widely used Logit Lens technique. By combining attributions with semantic alignment scores, we can automatically uncover reliance on components that encode semantically unexpected or spurious concepts. Applied across multiple CLIP variants, our method uncovers hundreds of surprising components linked to polysemous words, compound nouns, visual typography and dataset artifacts. While text embeddings remain prone to semantic ambiguity, they are more robust to spurious correlations compared to linear classifiers trained on image embeddings. A case study on skin lesion detection highlights how such classifiers can amplify hidden shortcuts, underscoring the need for holistic, mechanistic interpretability. We provide code at https://github.com/maxdreyer/attributing-clip.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages (10 pages manuscript, 4 pages references, 11 pages appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Measure Domain's Gap: A Similar Domain Selection Principle for Multi-Domain Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20227v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Domain Recommendation (MDR) achieves the desirable recommendation performance by effectively utilizing the transfer information across different domains. Despite the great success, most existing MDR methods adopt a single structure to transfer complex domain-shared knowledge. However, the beneficial transferring information should vary across different domains. When there is knowledge conflict between domains or a domain is of poor quality, unselectively leveraging information from all domains will lead to a serious Negative Transfer Problem (NTP). Therefore, how to effectively model the complex transfer relationships between domains to avoid NTP is still a direction worth exploring. To address these issues, we propose a simple and dynamic Similar Domain Selection Principle (SDSP) for multi-domain recommendation in this paper. SDSP presents the initial exploration of selecting suitable domain knowledge for each domain to alleviate NTP. Specifically, we propose a novel prototype-based domain distance measure to effectively model the complexity relationship between domains. Thereafter, the proposed SDSP can dynamically find similar domains for each domain based on the supervised signals of the domain metrics and the unsupervised distance measure from the learned domain prototype. We emphasize that SDSP is a lightweight method that can be incorporated with existing MDR methods for better performance while not introducing excessive time overheads. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first solution that can explicitly measure domain-level gaps and dynamically select appropriate domains in the MDR field. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |
| **[FLAME-MoE: A Transparent End-to-End Research Platform for Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20225v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models such as Gemini-1.5, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-4 increasingly adopt Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, which offer strong efficiency-performance trade-offs by activating only a fraction of the model per token. Yet academic researchers still lack a fully open, end-to-end MoE platform for investigating scaling, routing, and expert behavior. We release FLAME-MoE, a completely open-source research suite composed of seven decoder-only models, ranging from 38M to 1.7B active parameters, whose architecture--64 experts with top-8 gating and 2 shared experts--closely reflects modern production LLMs. All training data pipelines, scripts, logs, and checkpoints are publicly available to enable reproducible experimentation. Across six evaluation tasks, FLAME-MoE improves average accuracy by up to 3.4 points over dense baselines trained with identical FLOPs. Leveraging full training trace transparency, we present initial analyses showing that (i) experts increasingly specialize on distinct token subsets, (ii) co-activation matrices remain sparse, reflecting diverse expert usage, and (iii) routing behavior stabilizes early in training. All code, training logs, and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cmu-flame/FLAME-MoE.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code, training logs, and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/cmu-flame/FLAME-MoE</p></details> |
| **[Chain-of-Thought for Autonomous Driving: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Prospects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20223v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of large language models in natural language processing has substantially elevated their semantic understanding and logical reasoning capabilities. Such proficiencies have been leveraged in autonomous driving systems, contributing to significant improvements in system performance. Models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, an advanced cognitive method that simulates human thinking processes, demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities in complex tasks. By structuring complex driving scenarios within a systematic reasoning framework, this approach has emerged as a prominent research focus in autonomous driving, substantially improving the system's ability to handle challenging cases. This paper investigates how CoT methods improve the reasoning abilities of autonomous driving models. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we present a systematic analysis of the motivations, methodologies, challenges, and future research directions of CoT in autonomous driving. Furthermore, we propose the insight of combining CoT with self-learning to facilitate self-evolution in driving systems. To ensure the relevance and timeliness of this study, we have compiled a dynamic repository of literature and open-source projects, diligently updated to incorporate forefront developments. The repository is publicly available at https://github.com/cuiyx1720/Awesome-CoT4AD.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, as a common and intuitive mode of understanding, the potential of visual perception has been overlooked in the MPNN community. For the first time, we equip MPNNs with vision structural awareness by proposing an effective framework called Graph Vision Network (GVN), along with a more efficient variant (E-GVN). Extensive empirical results demonstrate that with the proposed frameworks, GVN consistently benefits from the vision enhancement across seven link prediction datasets, including challenging large-scale graphs. Such improvements are compatible with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and GVNs achieve new SOTA results, thereby underscoring a promising novel direction for link prediction.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Probabilistic Interactive 3D Segmentation with Hierarchical Neural Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01726v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive 3D segmentation has emerged as a promising solution for generating accurate object masks in complex 3D scenes by incorporating user-provided clicks. However, two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) effectively generalizing from sparse user clicks to produce accurate segmentation, and (2) quantifying predictive uncertainty to help users identify unreliable regions. In this work, we propose NPISeg3D, a novel probabilistic framework that builds upon Neural Processes (NPs) to address these challenges. Specifically, NPISeg3D introduces a hierarchical latent variable structure with scene-specific and object-specific latent variables to enhance few-shot generalization by capturing both global context and object-specific characteristics. Additionally, we design a probabilistic prototype modulator that adaptively modulates click prototypes with object-specific latent variables, improving the model's ability to capture object-aware context and quantify predictive uncertainty. Experiments on four 3D point cloud datasets demonstrate that NPISeg3D achieves superior segmentation performance with fewer clicks while providing reliable uncertainty estimations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Proceedings</p></details> |
| **[PathBench: A comprehensive comparison benchmark for pathology foundation models towards precision oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20202v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |

However, examining the multi-turn mental health conversation capabilities of LLMs remains under-explored. Existing evaluation frameworks typically focus on diagnostic accuracy and win-rates and often overlook alignment with patient-specific goals, values, and personalities required for meaningful conversations. To address this, we introduce MedAgent, a novel framework for synthetically generating realistic, multi-turn mental health sensemaking conversations and use it to create the Mental Health Sensemaking Dialogue (MHSD) dataset, comprising over 2,200 patient-LLM conversations. Additionally, we present MultiSenseEval, a holistic framework to evaluate the multi-turn conversation abilities of LLMs in healthcare settings using human-centric criteria. Our findings reveal that frontier reasoning models yield below-par performance for patient-centric communication and struggle at advanced diagnostic capabilities with average score of 31%. Additionally, we observed variation in model performance based on patient's persona and performance drop with increasing turns in the conversation. Our work provides a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework, a dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in multi-turn mental health conversations.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 5 figures, 30 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance via Dynamic Low-Confidence Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20199v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances controllability in generative models by interpolating conditional and unconditional predictions. However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked) diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model uncertainty in iterative generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/pixeli99/A-CFG</p></details> |

We explore 655,642 posts created between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2022. In line with previous studies for other countries and platforms, we find that the volume of posts on these topics can be tied to important external events, but not within-Reddit interactions. Sentiment, however, is influenced by the sentiment of previous posts, resulting in homophily and polarisation. We define a homophily measure and find values of 0.228, 0.198, and 0.133 for lockdowns, masks and vaccination, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel bounded confidence model that estimates internal sentiment of users from their expressed sentiment. The Wasserstein metric between the predicted and the observed sentiments takes values between 0.493 (vaccination) and 0.607 (lockdown). These results yield insight into the way the Belgian Reddit community experienced the pandemic, and which aspects influenced the topics discussed and their associated sentiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages; 9 figures; 5 tables</p></details> |

Established techniques such as unit testing, static analysis, and program fuzzing provide foundational protection mechanisms. Although symbolic execution tools have made significant contributions, opportunities remain to address the complexities of Go's runtime and concurrency model. In this work, we present Zorya, a novel methodology leveraging concrete and symbolic (concolic) execution to evaluate Go programs comprehensively. By systematically exploring execution paths to uncover vulnerabilities beyond conventional testing, symbolic execution offers distinct advantages, and coupling it with concrete execution mitigates the path explosion problem. Our solution employs Ghidra's P-Code as an intermediate representation (IR). This implementation detects runtime panics in the TinyGo compiler and supports both generic and custom invariants. Furthermore, P-Code's generic IR nature enables analysis of programs written in other languages such as C. Future enhancements may include intelligent classification of concolic execution logs to identify vulnerability patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 23rd IEEE/ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Management and Applications (SERA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[The Power of Iterative Filtering for Supervised Learning with (Heavy) Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20177v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift, we give a general outlier removal algorithm called iterative polynomial filtering and show a number of striking applications for supervised learning with contamination: (1) We show that any function class that can be approximated by low-degree polynomials with respect to a hypercontractive distribution can be efficiently learned under bounded contamination (also known as nasty noise). This is a surprising resolution to a longstanding gap between the complexity of agnostic learning and learning with contamination, as it was widely believed that low-degree approximators only implied tolerance to label noise. (2) For any function class that admits the (stronger) notion of sandwiching approximators, we obtain near-optimal learning guarantees even with respect to heavy additive contamination, where far more than $1/2$ of the training set may be added adversarially. Prior related work held only for regression and in a list-decodable setting. (3) We obtain the first efficient algorithms for tolerant testable learning of functions of halfspaces with respect to any fixed log-concave distribution. Even the non-tolerant case for a single halfspace in this setting had remained open. These results significantly advance our understanding of efficient supervised learning under contamination, a setting that has been much less studied than its unsupervised counterpart.</p></details> | 36 pages |

This work presents the first investigation of KANs for Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) tasks. We experiment with 2D-CNN models on two datasets, integrating KAN layers in five different configurations within the dense block. The best-performing setup, which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases. Finally, we provide insights into how KAN and linear layers on top of transformers differently attend to input regions of the raw waveforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

Although recent advancements at the intersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and robotics have highlighted its potential to handle versatile robotic tasks, current DRL-based collision-free motion planners for manipulators are highly costly, hindering their deployment and application. This is due to an overreliance on the minimum distance between the manipulator and obstacles, inadequate exploration and decision-making by DRL, and inefficient data acquisition and utilization. In this article, we propose URPlanner, a universal paradigm for collision-free robotic motion planning based on DRL. URPlanner offers several advantages over existing approaches: it is platform-agnostic, cost-effective in both training and deployment, and applicable to arbitrary manipulators without solving inverse kinematics. To achieve this, we first develop a parameterized task space and a universal obstacle avoidance reward that is independent of minimum distance. Second, we introduce an augmented policy exploration and evaluation algorithm that can be applied to various DRL algorithms to enhance their performance. Third, we propose an expert data diffusion strategy for efficient policy learning, which can produce a large-scale trajectory dataset from only a few expert demonstrations. Finally, the superiority of the proposed methods is comprehensively verified through experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 1. 20 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |

However, they struggle to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds suitable for interactive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://ryanpo.com/ssm_wm</p></details> |

Yet, conventional approaches based on fixed- or random-effects models lack a causal framework, which may limit their interpretability and utility for public policy. Incorporating causal inference reframes meta-analysis as the estimation of well-defined causal effects on clearly specified populations, enabling a principled approach to handling study heterogeneity. We show that classical meta-analysis estimators have a clear causal interpretation when effects are measured as risk differences. However, this breaks down for nonlinear measures like the risk ratio and odds ratio. To address this, we introduce novel causal aggregation formulas that remain compatible with standard meta-analysis practices and do not require access to individual-level data. To evaluate real-world impact, we apply both classical and causal meta-analysis methods to 500 published meta-analyses. While the conclusions often align, notable discrepancies emerge, revealing cases where conventional methods may suggest a treatment is beneficial when, under a causal lens, it is in fact harmful.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[From Alignment to Advancement: Bootstrapping Audio-Language Alignment with Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20166v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) have recently made great strides in understanding and processing audio inputs. These models are typically adapted from text-based large language models (LLMs) through additional training on audio-related tasks. However, this adaptation process presents two major limitations. First, ALLMs often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where important textual capabilities such as instruction-following are lost after training on audio data. In some cases, models may even hallucinate sounds that are not present in the input audio, raising concerns about their reliability. Second, achieving cross-modal alignment between audio and language typically relies on large collections of task-specific question-answer pairs for instruction tuning, making the process resource-intensive. To address these issues, we leverage the backbone LLMs from ALLMs to synthesize general-purpose caption-style alignment data. We refer to this process as bootstrapping audio-language alignment via synthetic data generation from backbone LLMs (BALSa). Building on BALSa, we introduce LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method designed to improve ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds. We further extend BALSa to multi-audio scenarios, where the model either explains the differences between audio inputs or produces a unified caption that describes them all, thereby enhancing audio-language alignment. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively mitigates audio hallucinations while reliably maintaining strong performance in audio understanding, reasoning, and instruction-following skills. Moreover, incorporating multi-audio training further enhances the model's comprehension and reasoning capabilities.

Existing 3D talking head generation models focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters, where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker conversations.

UORA achieves state-of-the-art performance and parameter efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method to reduce the number of trainable parameters. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UORA employs an interpolation-based reparametrization mechanism that selectively reinitializes rows and columns in frozen projection matrices, guided by the vector magnitude heuristic. This results in substantially fewer trainable parameters compared to LoRA and outperforms VeRA in computation and storage efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate UORA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with negligible computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and E2E benchmarks and its effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language models and image classification models. Our contributions establish a new paradigm for scalable and resource-efficient fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |

This distribution models the counts of individuals following iid stochastic dynamics among categories, with the number and identity of the categories also evolving over time. We specify the one-time and two-times marginal distributions of the counts and the first and second order moments. When the total number of individuals is unknown, placing a Poisson prior on it yields a new distribution (ECM-Poisson), whose main properties we also describe. Since likelihoods are intractable or impractical, we propose two estimating functions for parameter estimation: a Gaussian pseudo-likelihood and a pairwise composite likelihood. We show two application scenarios: the inference of movement parameters of animals moving continuously in space-time with irregular survey regions, and the inference of vote transfer in two-rounds elections. We give three illustrations: a simulation study with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck moving individuals, paying special attention to the autocorrelation parameter; the inference of movement and behavior parameters of lesser prairie-chickens; and the estimation of vote transfer in the 2021 Chilean presidential election.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body: 18 pages.

To guarantee that the vector representation of the multiset is faithful, it is often desirable to have multiset mappings that are both injective and bi-Lipschitz. Currently, there are several constructions of multiset functions achieving both these guarantees, leading to improved performance in some tasks but often also to higher compute time than standard constructions. Accordingly, it is natural to inquire whether simpler multiset functions achieving the same guarantees are available. In this paper, we make a large step towards giving a negative answer to this question. We consider the family of k-ary Janossy pooling, which includes many of the most popular multiset models, and prove that no piecewise linear Janossy pooling function can be injective. On the positive side, we show that when restricted to multisets without multiplicities, even simple deep-sets models suffice for injectivity and bi-Lipschitzness.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> | 29 pages |

However, most existing MLLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) architectures, which impose inherent limitations on future development, such as the raster-scan order in image generation and restricted reasoning abilities in causal context modeling. In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models. Furthermore, we show that applying test-time scaling techniques to FUDOKI yields significant performance gains, further underscoring its promise for future enhancement through reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 12 figures |

Existing model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging and task-guided fusion, often rely on data-dependent computations or fail to preserve internal knowledge, limiting their robustness and scalability. We introduce SeMe (Semantic-based Merging), a novel, data-free, and training-free approach that leverages latent semantic alignment to merge LMs at a fine-grained, layer-wise level. Unlike prior work, SeMe not only preserves model behaviors but also explicitly stabilizes internal knowledge, addressing a critical gap in LM fusion. Through extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks, we demonstrate that SeMe outperforms existing methods in both performance and efficiency while eliminating reliance on external data. Our work establishes a new paradigm for knowledge-aware model merging and provides insights into the semantic structure of LMs, paving the way for more scalable and interpretable model composition.</p></details> | <details><summary>an ea...</summary><p>an early-stage version</p></details> |

We introduce StructEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in producing both non-renderable (JSON, YAML, CSV) and renderable (HTML, React, SVG) structured formats. Unlike prior benchmarks, StructEval systematically evaluates structural fidelity across diverse formats through two paradigms: 1) generation tasks, producing structured output from natural language prompts, and 2) conversion tasks, translating between structured formats. Our benchmark encompasses 18 formats and 44 types of task, with novel metrics for format adherence and structural correctness. Results reveal significant performance gaps, even state-of-the-art models like o1-mini achieve only 75.58 average score, with open-source alternatives lagging approximately 10 points behind. We find generation tasks more challenging than conversion tasks, and producing correct visual content more difficult than generating text-only structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation, converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code available at https://github.com/cgoemaere/pc_error_optimization</p></details> |

These challenges are exacerbated in regulated sectors requiring tamper-proof, auditable evidence, as highlighted by apposite legal frameworks, e.g., the EU AI Act. Conversely, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a cryptographic solution that enables provers to demonstrate, through verified computations, adherence to set requirements without revealing sensitive model details or data. Through a systematic survey of ZKP protocols, we identify five key properties (non-interactivity, transparent setup, standard representations, succinctness, and post-quantum security) critical for their application in AI validation and verification pipelines. Subsequently, we perform a follow-up systematic survey analyzing ZKP-enhanced ML applications across an adaptation of the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) model (Data & Preprocessing, Training & Offline Metrics, Inference, and Online Metrics), detailing verification objectives, ML models, and adopted protocols. Our findings indicate that current research on ZKP-Enhanced ML primarily focuses on inference verification, while the data preprocessing and training stages remain underexplored. Most notably, our analysis identifies a significant convergence within the research domain toward the development of a unified Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning Operations (ZKMLOps) framework. This emerging framework leverages ZKPs to provide robust cryptographic guarantees of correctness, integrity, and privacy, thereby promoting enhanced accountability, transparency, and compliance with Trustworthy AI principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

The main challenges from these approaches, however, are the sheer amount of domain knowledge and implementation efforts required from human experts. Recently, significant progress has been made to address these challenges, particularly by using large language models (LLMs) to design heuristics within some predetermined generalized algorithmic framework (GAF, e.g., ant colony optimization and guided local search) for building key functions/components (e.g., a priori information on how promising it is to include each edge in a solution for TSP and CVRP). Although existing methods leveraging this idea have shown to yield impressive optimization performance, they are not fully end-to-end and still require considerable manual interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, named RedAHD, that enables these LLM-based heuristic design methods to operate without the need of GAFs. More specifically, RedAHD employs LLMs to automate the process of reduction, i.e., transforming the COP at hand into similar COPs that are better-understood, from which LLM-based heuristic design methods can design effective heuristics for directly solving the transformed COPs and, in turn, indirectly solving the original COP. Our experimental results, evaluated on six COPs, show that RedAHD is capable of designing heuristics with competitive or improved results over the state-of-the-art methods with minimal human involvement.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this paper, we address this challenge through our system submissions to the "Model Compression" track at the International Conference on Spoken Language Translation (IWSLT 2025). We experiment with a combination of approaches including iterative layer pruning based on layer importance evaluation, low-rank adaptation with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA), and knowledge distillation. In our experiments, we use Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct for speech translation into German and Chinese. Our pruned (student) models achieve up to a 50% reduction in both model parameters and storage footprint, while retaining 97-100% of the translation quality of the in-domain (teacher) models.</p></details> | IWSLT 2025 |

Our solution is based on a model-driven reverse engineering process composed of a chain of platform-independent model transformations. The extracted schema conforms to the \uschema{} unified metamodel, which can represent both NoSQL and relational schemas. To support this process, we define a metamodel capable of representing the core elements of object-oriented languages. Application code is first injected into a code model, from which a control flow model is derived. This, in turn, enables the generation of a model representing both data access operations and the structure of stored data. From these models, the \uschema{} logical schema is inferred. Additionally, the extracted information can be used to identify refactoring opportunities. We illustrate this capability through the detection of join-like query patterns and the automated application of field duplication strategies to eliminate expensive joins. All stages of the process are described in detail, and the approach is validated through a round-trip experiment in which a application using a MongoDB store is automatically generated from a predefined schema. The inferred schema is then compared to the original to assess the accuracy of the extraction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal Systems and Software, 23 pages</p></details> |

While recent works show that Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) yield interpretable latent components, they focus on what these encode and miss how they drive predictions. We introduce a scalable framework that reveals what latent components activate for, how they align with expected semantics, and how important they are to predictions. To achieve this, we adapt attribution patching for instance-wise component attributions in CLIP and highlight key faithfulness limitations of the widely used Logit Lens technique. By combining attributions with semantic alignment scores, we can automatically uncover reliance on components that encode semantically unexpected or spurious concepts. Applied across multiple CLIP variants, our method uncovers hundreds of surprising components linked to polysemous words, compound nouns, visual typography and dataset artifacts. While text embeddings remain prone to semantic ambiguity, they are more robust to spurious correlations compared to linear classifiers trained on image embeddings. A case study on skin lesion detection highlights how such classifiers can amplify hidden shortcuts, underscoring the need for holistic, mechanistic interpretability.

While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |

The best-performing setup, which places a KAN layer between two linear layers, is directly applied to transformer-based models and evaluated on five SLU datasets with increasing complexity. Our results show that KAN layers can effectively replace the linear layers, achieving comparable or superior performance in most cases.

This technique has shown promise as a model compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in modern deep learning workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been prepared for submission as a "Position paper" following the guidelines provided at https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPositionPapers</p></details> |

Our prototype implementation supports automatic termination proof search for NCPO and is also the first one to automate NHORPO with neutralization.</p></details> | accepted at CADE-30 |

Existing methods that rely on short-term motion data for intention estimation lack multi-step prediction capabilities, hindering their ability to sense intent changes and adjust human-robot assignments autonomously, resulting in potential discrepancies. To address these issues, we propose a Dual Transformer-based Robot Trajectron (DTRT) featuring a hierarchical architecture, which harnesses human-guided motion and force data to rapidly capture human intent changes, enabling accurate trajectory predictions and dynamic robot behavior adjustments for effective collaboration. Specifically, human intent estimation in DTRT uses two Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), incorporating robot motion data in obstacle-free case with human-guided trajectory and force for obstacle avoidance. Additionally, Differential Cooperative Game Theory (DCGT) is employed to synthesize predictions based on human-applied forces, ensuring robot behavior align with human intention. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, DTRT incorporates human dynamics into long-term prediction, providing an accurate understanding of intention and enabling rational role allocation, achieving robot autonomy and maneuverability. Experiments demonstrate DTRT's accurate intent estimation and superior collaboration performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

This leads to explanations that lack a unified view and may miss key interactions. While combining existing methods or applying them at different training stages offers broader insights, these approaches usually lack theoretical support. In this work, we present ExPLAIND, a unified framework that integrates all three perspectives. First, we generalize recent work on gradient path kernels, which reformulate models trained by gradient descent as a kernel machine, to more realistic training settings. Empirically, we find that both a CNN and a Transformer model are replicated accurately by this reformulation. Second, we derive novel parameter- and step-wise influence scores from the kernel feature maps. We show their effectiveness in parameter pruning that is comparable to existing methods, reinforcing their value for model component attribution. Finally, jointly interpreting model components and data over the training process, we leverage ExPLAIND to analyze a Transformer that exhibits Grokking. Among other things, our findings support previously proposed stages of Grokking, while refining the final phase as one of alignment of input embeddings and final layers around a representation pipeline learned after the memorization phase. Overall, ExPLAIND provides a theoretically grounded, unified framework to interpret model behavior and training dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main paper, 23 pages in total, code at https://github.com/mainlp/explaind</p></details> |

However, such verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data. However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead. We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1) Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models, enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2) Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation for narrowing activation functions' range. TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by 46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet, MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable, resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Correlating instruction-tuning (in multimodal models) with vision-language processing (in the brain)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20029v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models, though not explicitly trained to mimic brain recordings, have demonstrated surprising alignment with brain activity. Progress in these models-through increased size, instruction-tuning, and multimodality-has led to better representational alignment with neural data. Recently, a new class of instruction-tuned multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have emerged, showing remarkable zero-shot capabilities in open-ended multimodal vision tasks. However, it is unknown whether MLLMs, when prompted with natural instructions, lead to better brain alignment and effectively capture instruction-specific representations. To address this, we first investigate brain alignment, i.e., measuring the degree of predictivity of neural visual activity using text output response embeddings from MLLMs as participants engage in watching natural scenes. Experiments with 10 different instructions show that MLLMs exhibit significantly better brain alignment than vision-only models and perform comparably to non-instruction-tuned multimodal models like CLIP. We also find that while these MLLMs are effective at generating high-quality responses suitable to the task-specific instructions, not all instructions are relevant for brain alignment. Further, by varying instructions, we make the MLLMs encode instruction-specific visual concepts related to the input image. This analysis shows that MLLMs effectively capture count-related and recognition-related concepts, demonstrating strong alignment with brain activity. Notably, the majority of the explained variance of the brain encoding models is shared between MLLM embeddings of image captioning and other instructions. These results suggest that enhancing MLLMs' ability to capture task-specific information could lead to better differentiation between various types of instructions, and thereby improving their precision in predicting brain responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 22 figures, The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR-2025, Singapore. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=xkgfLXZ4e0</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal brain encoding models for multi-modal stimuli](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20027v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite participants engaging in unimodal stimuli, such as watching images or silent videos, recent work has demonstrated that multi-modal Transformer models can predict visual brain activity impressively well, even with incongruent modality representations. This raises the question of how accurately these multi-modal models can predict brain activity when participants are engaged in multi-modal stimuli. As these models grow increasingly popular, their use in studying neural activity provides insights into how our brains respond to such multi-modal naturalistic stimuli, i.e., where it separates and integrates information across modalities through a hierarchy of early sensory regions to higher cognition. We investigate this question by using multiple unimodal and two types of multi-modal models-cross-modal and jointly pretrained-to determine which type of model is more relevant to fMRI brain activity when participants are engaged in watching movies. We observe that both types of multi-modal models show improved alignment in several language and visual regions. This study also helps in identifying which brain regions process unimodal versus multi-modal information. We further investigate the contribution of each modality to multi-modal alignment by carefully removing unimodal features one by one from multi-modal representations, and find that there is additional information beyond the unimodal embeddings that is processed in the visual and language regions. Based on this investigation, we find that while for cross-modal models, their brain alignment is partially attributed to the video modality; for jointly pretrained models, it is partially attributed to both the video and audio modalities. This serves as a strong motivation for the neuroscience community to investigate the interpretability of these models for deepening our understanding of multi-modal information processing in brain.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 15 figures, The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR-2025, Singapore. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=0dELcFHig2</p></details> |

| **[Structure-Preserving Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Stiff Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01775v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are an effective approach for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems arising from simulations and experiments. One of the major shortcomings of NODEs, especially when coupled with explicit integrators, is its long-term stability, which impedes their efficiency and robustness when encountering stiff problems. In this work we present a structure-preserving NODE approach that learns a transformation into a system with a linear and nonlinear split. It is then integrated using an exponential integrator, which is an explicit integrator with stability properties comparable to implicit methods. We demonstrate that our model has advantages in both learning and deployment over standard explicit or even implicit NODE methods. The long-time stability is further enhanced by the Hurwitz matrix decomposition that constrains the spectrum of the linear operator, therefore stabilizing the linearized dynamics. When combined with a Lipschitz-controlled neural network treatment for the nonlinear operator, we show the nonlinear dynamics of the NODE are provably stable near a fixed point in the sense of Lyapunov. For high-dimensional data, we further rely on an autoencoder performing dimensionality reduction and Higham's algorithm for the matrix-free application of the matrix exponential on a vector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NODE approach in various examples, including the Robertson chemical reaction problem and the Kuramoto-Sivashinky equation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

Visual tokenizers and VAEs have significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling by providing more efficient compressed or quantized image representations. However, while helping production models reduce computational burdens, the information loss from image compression fundamentally limits the upper bound of visual generation quality. To evaluate this upper bound, we focus on assessing reconstructed text and facial features since they typically: 1) exist at smaller scales, 2) contain dense and rich textures, 3) are prone to collapse, and 4) are highly sensitive to human vision. We first collect and curate a diverse set of clear text and face images from existing datasets. Unlike approaches using VLM models, we employ established OCR and face recognition models for evaluation, ensuring accuracy while maintaining an exceptionally lightweight assessment process <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(214, 21, 21);">requiring just 2GB memory and 4 minutes</span> to complete. Using our benchmark, we analyze text and face reconstruction quality across various scales for different image tokenizers and VAEs. Our results show modern visual tokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, especially at smaller scales. We further extend this evaluation framework to video, conducting comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we demonstrate that traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect reconstruction performance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an effective complement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bench...</summary><p>Benchmark, homepagee: https://wjf5203.github.io/TokBench</p></details> |

However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL'25 main track</p></details> |
| **[UltraVSR: Achieving Ultra-Realistic Video Super-Resolution with Efficient One-Step Diffusion Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19958v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 10 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Nevertheless, current methodologies often struggle with background scene biases and inadequate motion detail. This paper proposes a novel dual-stream Multi-Timescale Motion-Decoupled Spiking Transformer (MDST++), which decouples contextual semantic information and sparse dynamic motion information. The recurrent joint learning unit is proposed to extract contextual semantic information and capture joint knowledge across various modalities to understand the environment of actions. By converting RGB images to events, our method captures motion information more accurately and mitigates background scene biases. Moreover, we introduce a discrepancy analysis block to model audio motion information. To enhance the robustness of SNNs in extracting temporal and motion cues, we dynamically adjust the threshold of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons based on global motion and contextual semantic information. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of MDST++, demonstrating their consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods on mainstream benchmarks. Additionally, incorporating motion and multi-timescale information significantly improves HM and ZSL accuracy by 26.2\% and 39.9\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

Token merging has emerged as a solution to increase computational efficiency in computer vision architectures. In this work, we perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both transformers and state-space models. We further introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, achieving two major benefits: a) Local merging can adjust its computational complexity from quadratic to linear based on the neighborhood size to effectively scale to long sequences; b) Local merging is the first causal merging scheme enabling token merging in transformer decoders. Further, we identify spectral properties of the input data that reliably predict the potential benefits of local merging without requiring evaluation on downstream tasks. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that local merging offers substantial efficiency gains with minimal impact on accuracy, achieving up to 5400% acceleration on the recently proposed Chronos foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages in total, 20 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Cognitive Writing Perspective for Constrained Long-Form Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12568v3)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Like humans, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to generate high-quality long-form text that adheres to strict requirements in a single pass. This challenge is unsurprising, as successful human writing, according to the Cognitive Writing Theory, is a complex cognitive process involving iterative planning, translating, reviewing, and monitoring. Motivated by these cognitive principles, we aim to equip LLMs with human-like cognitive writing capabilities through CogWriter, a novel training-free framework that transforms LLM constrained long-form text generation into a systematic cognitive writing paradigm. Our framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Planning Agent that performs hierarchical planning to decompose the task, and (2) multiple Generation Agents that execute these plans in parallel. The system maintains quality via continuous monitoring and reviewing mechanisms, which evaluate outputs against specified requirements and trigger necessary revisions. CogWriter demonstrates exceptional performance on LongGenBench, a benchmark for complex constrained long-form text generation. Even when using Qwen-2.5-14B as its backbone, CogWriter surpasses GPT-4o by 22% in complex instruction completion accuracy while reliably generating texts exceeding 10,000 words. We hope this cognitive science-inspired approach provides a paradigm for LLM writing advancements: \href{https://github.com/KaiyangWan/CogWriter}{CogWriter}.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery.

| **[APB: Accelerating Distributed Long-Context Inference by Passing Compressed Context Blocks across GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12085v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While long-context inference is crucial for advancing large language model (LLM) applications, its prefill speed remains a significant bottleneck. Current approaches, including sequence parallelism strategies and compute reduction through approximate attention mechanisms, still fall short of delivering optimal inference efficiency. This hinders scaling the inputs to longer sequences and processing long-context queries in a timely manner. To address this, we introduce APB, an efficient long-context inference framework that leverages multi-host approximate attention to enhance prefill speed by reducing compute and enhancing parallelism simultaneously. APB introduces a communication mechanism for essential key-value pairs within a sequence parallelism framework, enabling a faster inference speed while maintaining task performance. We implement APB by incorporating a tailored FlashAttn kernel alongside optimized distribution strategies, supporting diverse models and parallelism configurations. APB achieves speedups of up to 9.2x, 4.2x, and 1.6x compared with FlashAttn, RingAttn, and StarAttn, respectively, without any observable task performance degradation. We provide the implementation and experiment code of APB in https://github.com/thunlp/APB.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |
| **[Generalized and Personalized Federated Learning with Foundation Models via Orthogonal Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19888v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) aims to train models across decentralized clients or devices holding local data without the need for centralized data collection, thus enhancing data privacy and security. However, achieving both generalization and personalization in heterogeneous settings remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce FedOT, a novel approach that leverages black-box foundation models. FedOT shares only a global task-dependent classifier across clients while locally adapting features through orthogonal transformations. By enforcing orthogonality, FedOT mitigates gradient conflicts across diverse clients, preserves semantic integrity, and achieves robust performance even in the presence of substantial data heterogeneity. The strategy of combining global and local parameters enables a more balanced approach for both generalization and personalization, outperforming baseline FL methods across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our extensive analysis confirms that joint optimization of global classifiers and local orthogonal transformations yields superior performance and suggests broader applicability.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 29th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GoLF-NRT: Integrating Global Context and Local Geometry for Few-Shot View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19813v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have transformed novel view synthesis by modeling scene-specific volumetric representations directly from images. While generalizable NeRF models can generate novel views across unknown scenes by learning latent ray representations, their performance heavily depends on a large number of multi-view observations. However, with limited input views, these methods experience significant degradation in rendering quality. To address this limitation, we propose GoLF-NRT: a Global and Local feature Fusion-based Neural Rendering Transformer. GoLF-NRT enhances generalizable neural rendering from few input views by leveraging a 3D transformer with efficient sparse attention to capture global scene context. In parallel, it integrates local geometric features extracted along the epipolar line, enabling high-quality scene reconstruction from as few as 1 to 3 input views. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy based on attention weights and kernel regression, improving the accuracy of transformer-based neural rendering. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that GoLF-NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance across varying numbers of input views, highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

| **[Efficient Multi-modal Long Context Learning for Training-free Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19812v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input. EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/EMLoC.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |

However, speed fluctuation of the trains and few fault samples are the two main problems that restrict the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis. Therefore, a cross-machine transfer diagnosis (pyDSN) network coupled with interpretable modulated differentiable short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and physics-informed balanced spectrum quality metric is proposed to learn domain-invariant and discriminative features under time-varying speeds. Firstly, due to insufficiency in extracting extract frequency components of time-varying speed signals using fixed windows, a modulated differentiable STFT (MDSTFT) that is interpretable with STFT-informed theoretical support, is proposed to extract the robust time-frequency spectrum (TFS). During training process, multiple windows with different lengths dynamically change. Also, in addition to the classification metric and domain discrepancy metric, we creatively introduce a third kind of metric, referred to as the physics-informed metric, to enhance transferable TFS. A physics-informed balanced spectrum quality (BSQ) regularization loss is devised to guide an optimization direction for MDSTFT and model. With it, not only can model acquire high-quality TFS, but also a physics-restricted domain adaptation network can be also acquired, making it learn real-world physics knowledge, ultimately diminish the domain discrepancy across different datasets. The experiment is conducted in the scenario of migrating from the laboratory datasets to the freight train dataset, indicating that the hybrid-driven pyDSN outperforms existing methods and has practical value.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted and published by Advanced Engineering Informatics.

Building upon the fixed-point emergence structures developed in Alpay Algebra I and II, this third installment formalizes the observer-coupled {\phi}-collapse process through transfinite categorical flows and curvature-driven identity operators. We define a novel temporal drift mechanism as a recursive deformation of identity signatures under entangled observer influence, constructing categorical invariants that evolve across fold iterations. The proposed system surpasses conventional identity modeling in explainable AI (XAI) by encoding internal transformation history into a symbolic fixed-point structure, offering provable traceability and temporal coherence. Applications range from AI self-awareness architectures to formal logic systems where identity is not static but dynamically induced by observation. The theoretical results also offer a mathematically rigorous basis for future AI systems with stable self-referential behavior, positioning Alpay Algebra as a next-generation symbolic framework bridging category theory, identity logic, and observer dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 0 figures.

If choose to resize the UHR image to standard input image size, the extensive spatial and contextual information that UHR images contain will be neglected. Otherwise, the original size of these images often exceeds the token limits of standard RSMLLMs, making it difficult to process the entire image and capture long-range dependencies to answer the query based on the abundant visual context. In this paper, we introduce ImageRAG for RS, a training-free framework to address the complexities of analyzing UHR remote sensing imagery. By transforming UHR remote sensing image analysis task to image's long context selection task, we design an innovative image contextual retrieval mechanism based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, denoted as ImageRAG. ImageRAG's core innovation lies in its ability to selectively retrieve and focus on the most relevant portions of the UHR image as visual contexts that pertain to a given query. Fast path and slow path are proposed in this framework to handle this task efficiently and effectively. ImageRAG allows RSMLLMs to manage extensive context and spatial information from UHR RSI, ensuring the analysis is both accurate and efficient.

Unlike transformer-based models, these architectures encode all contextual information into a fixed-size state, leading to great inference efficiency. However, this approach can cause information interference, where different token data conflicts, resulting in performance degradation and incoherent outputs beyond a certain context length. To prevent this, most RNNs incorporate mechanisms designed to "forget" earlier tokens. In this paper, we reveal that Mamba-based models struggle to effectively forget earlier tokens even with built-in forgetting mechanisms. We demonstrate that this issue stems from training on contexts that are too short for the state size, enabling the model to perform well without needing to learn how to forget. Then, we show that the minimum training length required for the model to learn forgetting scales linearly with the state size, and the maximum context length for accurate retrieval of a 5-digit passkey scales exponentially with the state size, indicating that the model retains some information beyond the point where forgetting begins. These findings highlight a critical limitation in current RNN architectures and provide valuable insights for improving long-context modeling. Our work suggests that future RNN designs must account for the interplay between state size, training length, and forgetting mechanisms to achieve robust performance in long-context tasks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting performance.

We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data.

In this paper, we explore the idea that CV adopts discrete and terminological task definitions (\eg, ``image segmentation''), which may be a key barrier to zero-shot task generalization. Our hypothesis is that without truly understanding previously-seen tasks--due to these terminological definitions--deep models struggle to generalize to novel tasks. To verify this, we introduce Explanatory Instructions, which provide an intuitive way to define CV task objectives through detailed linguistic transformations from input images to outputs. We create a large-scale dataset comprising 12 million ``image input $\to$ explanatory instruction $\to$ output'' triplets, and train an auto-regressive-based vision-language model (AR-based VLM) that takes both images and explanatory instructions as input. By learning to follow these instructions, the AR-based VLM achieves instruction-level zero-shot capabilities for previously-seen tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization for unseen CV tasks. Code and dataset will be openly available on our GitHub repository.</p></details> | ICML'25, 44 pages |

It motivates researchers to introduce more examples to provide additional contextual information for the generation. However, existing methods show a significant limitation due to the problem of excessive growth in context length, which causes a large hardware burden. In addition, shallow-relevant examples selected by off-the-shelf tools hinder LLMs from capturing useful contextual information for generation. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UniICL}, a novel \textbf{Uni}fied \textbf{ICL} framework that unifies demonstration compression, demonstration selection, and final response generation. Furthermore, to boost inference efficiency, we design a tailored compression strategy that allows UniICL to cache compression results into \textbf{Demonstration Bank} (\textbf{DB}), which avoids repeated compression of the same demonstration. Extensive out-of-domain evaluations prove the advantages of UniICL in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | ACL2025 |

This paper proposes a system to automatically assess fluency by combining a fine-tuned multilingual ASR model, an objective metrics extraction stage, and a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) network. The objective metrics include phonetic and word error rates, speech rate, and speech-pause duration ratio. These are interpreted by a GPT-based classifier guided by a small set of human-evaluated ground truth examples, to score fluency. We evaluate the proposed system on a dataset of children's speech in two low-resource languages, Tamil and Malay and compare the classification performance against Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as using ChatGPT-4o to predict fluency directly from speech input. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher accuracy than multimodal GPT or other methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |

Among MISR tasks, burst super-resolution (BurstSR) has gained significant attention due to its wide range of applications. Recent methods have increasingly adopted Transformers over convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in super-resolution tasks, due to their superior ability to capture both local and global context. However, most existing approaches still rely on fixed and narrow attention windows that restrict the perception of features beyond the local field. This limitation hampers alignment and feature aggregation, both of which are crucial for high-quality super-resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a novel feature extractor that incorporates two newly designed attention mechanisms: overlapping cross-window attention and cross-frame attention, enabling more precise and efficient extraction of sub-pixel information across multiple frames. Furthermore, we introduce a Multi-scan State-Space Module with the cross-frame attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Additional evaluations on ISO 12233 resolution test charts further confirm its enhanced super-resolution performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 13 figures, submitted to 'Image and Vision Computing'</p></details> |

To simulate real-world usage, we introduce a comprehensive audio attack pipeline, featuring various distortions such as compression, background noise, and reverberation, and propose a diverse test dataset, including speech, environmental sounds, and music recordings. By assessing the performance of four existing watermarking algorithms on our framework, two main insights stand out: (i) neural compression techniques pose the most significant challenge, even when algorithms are trained with such compressions; and (ii) training with audio attacks generally improves robustness, although it is insufficient in some cases. Furthermore, we find that specific distortions, such as polarity inversion, time stretching, or reverb, seriously affect certain algorithms. Our contributions strengthen the robustness and perceptual assessment of audio watermarking algorithms across a wide range of applications, while ensuring a fair and consistent evaluation approach. The evaluation framework, including the attack pipeline, is accessible at github.com/SonyResearch/wm_robustness_eval.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages; 5 tables; accepted at INTERSPEECH 2025</p></details> |

However, the pioneered attempts still fall behind the continuous counterparts, which we attribute to the noise (absorbing state) design and sampling heuristics. In this study, we propose the rehashing noise framework for discrete diffusion transformer, termed ReDDiT, to extend absorbing states and improve expressive capacity of discrete diffusion models. ReDDiT enriches the potential paths that latent variables can traverse during training with randomized multi-index corruption. The derived rehash sampler, which reverses the randomized absorbing paths, guarantees the diversity and low discrepancy of the generation process. These reformulations lead to more consistent and competitive generation quality, mitigating the need for heavily tuned randomness. Experiments show that ReDDiT significantly outperforms the baseline (reducing gFID from 6.18 to 1.61) and is on par with the continuous counterparts with higher efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under development</p></details> |

These methods typically alternate between LLM reasoning and retrieval to accumulate external information into the LLM's context. However, the ever-growing context inherently imposes an increasing burden on the LLM to perceive connections among critical information pieces, with futile reasoning steps further exacerbating this overload issue. In this paper, we present KnowTrace, an elegant RAG framework to (1) mitigate the context overload and (2) bootstrap higher-quality multi-step reasoning. Instead of simply piling the retrieved contents, KnowTrace autonomously traces out desired knowledge triplets to organize a specific knowledge graph relevant to the input question. Such a structured workflow not only empowers the LLM with an intelligible context for inference, but also naturally inspires a reflective mechanism of knowledge backtracing to identify contributive LLM generations as process supervision data for self-bootstrapping. Extensive experiments show that KnowTrace consistently surpasses existing methods across three multi-hop question answering benchmarks, and the bootstrapped version further amplifies the gains.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

Historical reasoning poses unique challenges for AI, involving multimodal source interpretation, temporal inference, and cross-linguistic analysis. While general-purpose agents perform well on many existing benchmarks, they lack the domain-specific expertise required to engage with historical materials and questions. To address this gap, we introduce HistBench, a new benchmark of 414 high-quality questions designed to evaluate AI's capacity for historical reasoning and authored by more than 40 expert contributors. The tasks span a wide range of historical problems-from factual retrieval based on primary sources to interpretive analysis of manuscripts and images, to interdisciplinary challenges involving archaeology, linguistics, or cultural history. Furthermore, the benchmark dataset spans 29 ancient and modern languages and covers a wide range of historical periods and world regions. Finding the poor performance of LLMs and other agents on HistBench, we further present HistAgent, a history-specific agent equipped with carefully designed tools for OCR, translation, archival search, and image understanding in History. On HistBench, HistAgent based on GPT-4o achieves an accuracy of 27.54% pass@1 and 36.47% pass@2, significantly outperforming LLMs with online search and generalist agents, including GPT-4o (18.60%), DeepSeek-R1(14.49%) and Open Deep Research-smolagents(20.29% pass@1 and 25.12% pass@2). These results highlight the limitations of existing LLMs and generalist agents and demonstrate the advantages of HistAgent for historical reasoning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

Our solution is based on a model-driven reverse engineering process composed of a chain of platform-independent model transformations. The extracted schema conforms to the \uschema{} unified metamodel, which can represent both NoSQL and relational schemas. To support this process, we define a metamodel capable of representing the core elements of object-oriented languages. Application code is first injected into a code model, from which a control flow model is derived. This, in turn, enables the generation of a model representing both data access operations and the structure of stored data. From these models, the \uschema{} logical schema is inferred. Additionally, the extracted information can be used to identify refactoring opportunities. We illustrate this capability through the detection of join-like query patterns and the automated application of field duplication strategies to eliminate expensive joins. All stages of the process are described in detail, and the approach is validated through a round-trip experiment in which a application using a MongoDB store is automatically generated from a predefined schema. The inferred schema is then compared to the original to assess the accuracy of the extraction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal Systems and Software, 23 pages</p></details> |

However, they struggle to maintain long-term memory due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences in attention layers. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel architecture leveraging state-space models (SSMs) to extend temporal memory without compromising computational efficiency. Unlike previous approaches that retrofit SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, our method fully exploits the inherent advantages of SSMs in causal sequence modeling. Central to our design is a block-wise SSM scanning scheme, which strategically trades off spatial consistency for extended temporal memory, combined with dense local attention to ensure coherence between consecutive frames. We evaluate the long-term memory capabilities of our model through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks over extended horizons. Experiments on Memory Maze and Minecraft datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses baselines in preserving long-range memory, while maintaining practical inference speeds suitable for interactive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://ryanpo.com/ssm_wm</p></details> |

Yet, conventional approaches based on fixed- or random-effects models lack a causal framework, which may limit their interpretability and utility for public policy. Incorporating causal inference reframes meta-analysis as the estimation of well-defined causal effects on clearly specified populations, enabling a principled approach to handling study heterogeneity. We show that classical meta-analysis estimators have a clear causal interpretation when effects are measured as risk differences. However, this breaks down for nonlinear measures like the risk ratio and odds ratio. To address this, we introduce novel causal aggregation formulas that remain compatible with standard meta-analysis practices and do not require access to individual-level data. To evaluate real-world impact, we apply both classical and causal meta-analysis methods to 500 published meta-analyses. While the conclusions often align, notable discrepancies emerge, revealing cases where conventional methods may suggest a treatment is beneficial when, under a causal lens, it is in fact harmful.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

This distribution models the counts of individuals following iid stochastic dynamics among categories, with the number and identity of the categories also evolving over time. We specify the one-time and two-times marginal distributions of the counts and the first and second order moments. When the total number of individuals is unknown, placing a Poisson prior on it yields a new distribution (ECM-Poisson), whose main properties we also describe. Since likelihoods are intractable or impractical, we propose two estimating functions for parameter estimation: a Gaussian pseudo-likelihood and a pairwise composite likelihood. We show two application scenarios: the inference of movement parameters of animals moving continuously in space-time with irregular survey regions, and the inference of vote transfer in two-rounds elections. We give three illustrations: a simulation study with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck moving individuals, paying special attention to the autocorrelation parameter; the inference of movement and behavior parameters of lesser prairie-chickens; and the estimation of vote transfer in the 2021 Chilean presidential election.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body: 18 pages.

These challenges are exacerbated in regulated sectors requiring tamper-proof, auditable evidence, as highlighted by apposite legal frameworks, e.g., the EU AI Act. Conversely, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a cryptographic solution that enables provers to demonstrate, through verified computations, adherence to set requirements without revealing sensitive model details or data. Through a systematic survey of ZKP protocols, we identify five key properties (non-interactivity, transparent setup, standard representations, succinctness, and post-quantum security) critical for their application in AI validation and verification pipelines. Subsequently, we perform a follow-up systematic survey analyzing ZKP-enhanced ML applications across an adaptation of the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) model (Data & Preprocessing, Training & Offline Metrics, Inference, and Online Metrics), detailing verification objectives, ML models, and adopted protocols. Our findings indicate that current research on ZKP-Enhanced ML primarily focuses on inference verification, while the data preprocessing and training stages remain underexplored. Most notably, our analysis identifies a significant convergence within the research domain toward the development of a unified Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning Operations (ZKMLOps) framework. This emerging framework leverages ZKPs to provide robust cryptographic guarantees of correctness, integrity, and privacy, thereby promoting enhanced accountability, transparency, and compliance with Trustworthy AI principles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

We propose TrojanStego, a novel threat model in which an adversary fine-tunes an LLM to embed sensitive context information into natural-looking outputs via linguistic steganography, without requiring explicit control over inference inputs. We introduce a taxonomy outlining risk factors for compromised LLMs, and use it to evaluate the risk profile of the threat. To implement TrojanStego, we propose a practical encoding scheme based on vocabulary partitioning learnable by LLMs via fine-tuning. Experimental results show that compromised models reliably transmit 32-bit secrets with 87% accuracy on held-out prompts, reaching over 97% accuracy using majority voting across three generations. Further, they maintain high utility, can evade human detection, and preserve coherence. These results highlight a new class of LLM data exfiltration attacks that are passive, covert, practical, and dangerous.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $\kappa$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $\alpha-\kappa$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 is...</summary><p>v2 is a major update with several new results, in particular with respect to the binary case</p></details> |

Through experiments on Question Answering, we show prompt preference consistency across LLMs of different sizes. We also show that this consistency extends to other tasks, such as Natural Language Inference. Utilizing this consistency, we propose a method to use a smaller model to select effective prompt templates for a larger model. We show that our method substantially reduces the cost of prompt engineering while consistently matching performance with optimal prompts among candidates. More importantly, our experiment shows the efficacy of our strategy across fourteen LLMs and its applicability to a broad range of NLP tasks, highlighting its robustness</p></details> | 15 pages |

As privacy concerns grow, the assumption of MIA, which presumes that attackers can obtain an auxiliary dataset with the same distribution, is increasingly deviating from reality. In this paper, we categorize the distribution diversity issue in real-world MIA scenarios as an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) problem, and propose a novel Graph OOD Membership Inference Attack (GOOD-MIA) to achieve cross-domain graph attacks. Specifically, we construct shadow subgraphs with distributions from different domains to model the diversity of real-world data. We then explore the stable node representations that remain unchanged under external influences and consider eliminating redundant information from confounding environments and extracting task-relevant key information to more clearly distinguish between the characteristics of training data and unseen data. This OOD-based design makes cross-domain graph attacks possible. Finally, we perform risk extrapolation to optimize the attack's domain adaptability during attack inference to generalize the attack to other domains. Experimental results demonstrate that GOOD-MIA achieves superior attack performance in datasets designed for multiple domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-25)</p></details> |

However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research.

However, such verification typically requires access to model weights and (potentially sensitive or private) training data. So-called Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs) would appear to provide the capability to verify model inference without access to such sensitive data. However, applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks, such as transformers and large vision models, introduces significant computational overhead. We present TeleSparse, a ZK-friendly post-processing mechanisms to produce practical solutions to this problem. TeleSparse tackles two fundamental challenges inherent in applying ZK-SNARKs to modern neural networks: (1) Reducing circuit constraints: Over-parameterized models result in numerous constraints for ZK-SNARK verification, driving up memory and proof generation costs. We address this by applying sparsification to neural network models, enhancing proof efficiency without compromising accuracy or security. (2) Minimizing the size of lookup tables required for non-linear functions, by optimizing activation ranges through neural teleportation, a novel adaptation for narrowing activation functions' range. TeleSparse reduces prover memory usage by 67% and proof generation time by 46% on the same model, with an accuracy trade-off of approximately 1%. We implement our framework using the Halo2 proving system and demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple architectures (Vision-transformer, ResNet, MobileNet) and datasets (ImageNet,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100). This work opens new directions for ZK-friendly model design, moving toward scalable, resource-efficient verifiable deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) 2025</p></details> |

We conduct experiments in the agent self-improving benchmark, OpenWebVoyager, and demonstrate that distilling salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can substantially enhance its performance.

We provide both theoretical, regarding the consistency of functional causal effects, as well as empirical comparison of a range of proposed causal effect estimators. Applications to binary treatment settings with functional outcomes illustrate the framework's utility in biomedical monitoring, where outcomes exhibit complex temporal dynamics. Our estimators accommodate scenarios with registered covariates and outcomes, aligning them to the Fr\'{e}chet means, as well as cases requiring higher-order representations to capture intricate covariate-outcome interactions.

To this end, prediction-powered inference has risen as a promising methodology, but existing approaches are largely limited to Z-estimation problems such as inference of means and quantiles. In this paper, we apply ideas of prediction-powered inference to e-values. By doing so, we inherit all the usual benefits of e-values -- such as anytime-validity, post-hoc validity and versatile sequential inference -- as well as greatly expand the set of inferences achievable in a prediction-powered manner. In particular, we show that every inference procedure that can be framed in terms of e-values has a prediction-powered counterpart, given by our method. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework across a wide range of inference tasks, from simple hypothesis testing and confidence intervals to more involved procedures for change-point detection and causal discovery, which were out of reach of previous techniques. Our approach is modular and easily integrable into existing algorithms, making it a compelling choice for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

We introduce Mixture of Accent-Specific LoRAs (MAS-LoRA), a fine-tuning method that leverages a mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, each specialized in a specific accent. This method can be used when the accent is known or unknown at inference time, without the need to fine-tune the model again. Our experiments, conducted using Whisper on the L2-ARCTIC corpus, demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error Rate compared to regular LoRA and full fine-tuning when the accent is unknown. When the accent is known, the results further improve. Furthermore, MAS-LoRA shows less catastrophic forgetting than the other fine-tuning methods.

Such models usually have to deliver highly accurate results within a short time frame. Methods that are commonly employed in literature start out with larger trained models and try to reduce their memory and latency footprint by structural pruning, knowledge distillation, or quantization. It is, however, also possible to leverage hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS), an approach that seeks to systematically explore the architecture space to find optimized configurations. In this study, a hardware-aware NAS workflow is introduced that couples an edge device located in Belgium with a powerful High-Performance Computing system in Germany, to train possible architecture candidates as fast as possible while performing real-time latency measurements on the target hardware. The approach is verified on a use case in the AM domain, based on the open RAISE-LPBF dataset, achieving ~8.8 times faster inference speed while simultaneously enhancing model quality by a factor of ~1.35, compared to a human-designed baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, accepted for oral presentation at Computational Aspects of Deep Learning 2025 (at ISC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[PHI: Bridging Domain Shift in Long-Term Action Quality Assessment via Progressive Hierarchical Instruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19972v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to evaluate the quantitative performance of actions in long videos. However, existing methods face challenges due to domain shifts between the pre-trained large-scale action recognition backbones and the specific AQA task, thereby hindering their performance. This arises since fine-tuning resource-intensive backbones on small AQA datasets is impractical. We address this by identifying two levels of domain shift: task-level, regarding differences in task objectives, and feature-level, regarding differences in important features. For feature-level shifts, which are more detrimental, we propose Progressive Hierarchical Instruction (PHI) with two strategies. First, Gap Minimization Flow (GMF) leverages flow matching to progressively learn a fast flow path that reduces the domain gap between initial and desired features across shallow to deep layers. Additionally, a temporally-enhanced attention module captures long-range dependencies essential for AQA. Second, List-wise Contrastive Regularization (LCR) facilitates coarse-to-fine alignment by comprehensively comparing batch pairs to learn fine-grained cues while mitigating domain shift. Integrating these modules, PHI offers an effective solution. Experiments demonstrate that PHI achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative long-term AQA datasets, proving its superiority in addressing the domain shift for long-term AQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |

We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL'25 main track</p></details> |

However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporal-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Restoration Schedule (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. This design eliminates randomness from diffusion noise and significantly speeds up inference. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight yet effective Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, composed of an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, these two units collaboratively facilitate effective feature propagation, fusion, and alignment across neighboring frames, without relying on explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporal coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review, 10 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dynamically Learned Test-Time Model Routing in Language Model Zoos with Service Level Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19947v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-weight LLM zoos provide access to numerous high-quality models, but selecting the appropriate model for specific tasks remains challenging and requires technical expertise. Most users simply want factually correct, safe, and satisfying responses without concerning themselves with model technicalities, while inference service providers prioritize minimizing operating costs. These competing interests are typically mediated through service level agreements (SLAs) that guarantee minimum service quality. We introduce MESS+, a stochastic optimization algorithm for cost-optimal LLM request routing while providing rigorous SLA compliance guarantees. MESS+ learns request satisfaction probabilities of LLMs in real-time as users interact with the system, based on which model selection decisions are made by solving a per-request optimization problem. Our algorithm includes a novel combination of virtual queues and request satisfaction prediction, along with a theoretical analysis of cost optimality and constraint satisfaction. Across a wide range of state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, MESS+ achieves an average of 2x cost savings compared to existing LLM routing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Current approaches, including sequence parallelism strategies and compute reduction through approximate attention mechanisms, still fall short of delivering optimal inference efficiency. This hinders scaling the inputs to longer sequences and processing long-context queries in a timely manner. To address this, we introduce APB, an efficient long-context inference framework that leverages multi-host approximate attention to enhance prefill speed by reducing compute and enhancing parallelism simultaneously. APB introduces a communication mechanism for essential key-value pairs within a sequence parallelism framework, enabling a faster inference speed while maintaining task performance. We implement APB by incorporating a tailored FlashAttn kernel alongside optimized distribution strategies, supporting diverse models and parallelism configurations. APB achieves speedups of up to 9.2x, 4.2x, and 1.6x compared with FlashAttn, RingAttn, and StarAttn, respectively, without any observable task performance degradation. We provide the implementation and experiment code of APB in https://github.com/thunlp/APB.</p></details> | ACL 2025 main |
| **[A fully automated urban PV parameterization framework for improved estimation of energy production profiles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19876v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate parameterization of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) installations is critical for effective grid management and strategic large-scale solar deployment. The lack of high-fidelity datasets for PV configuration parameters often compels practitioners to rely on coarse assumptions, undermining both the temporal and numerical accuracy of large-scale PV performance modeling. This study introduces a fully automated framework that innovatively integrates remote sensing data, semantic segmentation, polygon-vector refinement, tilt-azimuth estimation, and module layout inference to produce a richly attributed GIS dataset of distributed PV. Applied to Eindhoven (the Netherlands), the method achieves a correlation ($R^2$) of 0.92 with Distribution System Operator (DSO) records, while capacity estimates for 73$\%$ of neighborhoods demonstrate agreement within a $\pm$25$\%$ margin of recorded data. Additionally, by accurately capturing actual system configuration parameters (e.g., tilt, azimuth, module layout) and seamlessly linking them to advanced performance models, the method yields more reliable PV energy generation forecasts within the distribution networks. Centering our experiments toward a high PV-penetration community, configuration-aware simulations help to reduce Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of energy generation modeling by up to 160$\%$ compared to the conventional assumption-based approaches. Furthermore, owing to its modular design and reliance on readily available geospatial resources, the workflow can be extended across diverse regions, offering a scalable solution for robust urban solar integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Solar Energy for peer review. 42 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[REA-RL: Reflection-Aware Online Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19862v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance in complex tasks but often face the challenge of overthinking, leading to substantially high inference costs. Existing approaches synthesize shorter reasoning responses for LRMs to learn, but are inefficient for online usage due to the time-consuming data generation and filtering processes. Meanwhile, online reinforcement learning mainly adopts a length reward to encourage short reasoning responses, but tends to lose the reflection ability and harm the performance. To address these issues, we propose REA-RL, which introduces a small reflection model for efficient scaling in online training, offering both parallel sampling and sequential revision. Besides, a reflection reward is designed to further prevent LRMs from favoring short yet non-reflective responses. Experiments show that both methods maintain or enhance performance while significantly improving inference efficiency. Their combination achieves a good balance between performance and efficiency, reducing inference costs by 35% without compromising performance. Further analysis demonstrates that our methods are effective by maintaining reflection frequency for hard problems while appropriately reducing it for simpler ones without losing reflection ability.

It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However, GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method, called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of objects using just three images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[HIT Model: A Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower Model for Pre-Ranking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19849v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online display advertising platforms rely on pre-ranking systems to efficiently filter and prioritize candidate ads from large corpora, balancing relevance to users with strict computational constraints. The prevailing two-tower architecture, though highly efficient due to its decoupled design and pre-caching, suffers from cross-domain interaction and coarse similarity metrics, undermining its capacity to model complex user-ad relationships. In this study, we propose the Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower (HIT) model, a new architecture that augments the two-tower paradigm with two key components: $\textit{generators}$ that pre-generate holistic vectors incorporating coarse-grained user-ad interactions through a dual-generator framework with a cosine-similarity-based generation loss as the training objective, and $\textit{multi-head representers}$ that project embeddings into multiple latent subspaces to capture fine-grained, multi-faceted user interests and multi-dimensional ad attributes. This design enhances modeling effectiveness without compromising inference efficiency. Extensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing on Tencent's advertising platform demonstrate that HIT significantly outperforms several baselines in relevance metrics, yielding a $1.66\%$ increase in Gross Merchandise Volume and a $1.55\%$ improvement in Return on Investment, alongside similar serving latency to the vanilla two-tower models. The HIT model has been successfully deployed in Tencent's online display advertising system, serving billions of impressions daily.

However, existing backdoor attacks face limitations manifesting in excessive reliance on training data, poor stealth, and instability, which hinder their effectiveness in real-world applications. Therefore, this paper introduces ShadowPrint, a versatile backdoor attack that targets feature embeddings within neural networks to achieve high ASRs and stealthiness. Unlike traditional approaches, ShadowPrint reduces reliance on training data access and operates effectively with exceedingly low poison rates (as low as 0.01%). It leverages a clustering-based optimization strategy to align feature embeddings, ensuring robust performance across diverse scenarios while maintaining stability and stealth. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ShadowPrint achieves superior ASR (up to 100%), steady CA (with decay no more than 1% in most cases), and low DDR (averaging below 5%) across both clean-label and dirty-label settings, and with poison rates ranging from as low as 0.01% to 0.05%, setting a new standard for backdoor attack capabilities and emphasizing the need for advanced defense strategies focused on feature space manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Multi-modal Long Context Learning for Training-free Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19812v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional approaches to adapting multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to new tasks have relied heavily on fine-tuning. This paper introduces Efficient Multi-Modal Long Context Learning (EMLoC), a novel training-free alternative that embeds demonstration examples directly into the model input. EMLoC offers a more efficient, flexible, and scalable solution for task adaptation. Because extremely lengthy inputs introduce prohibitive computational and memory overhead, EMLoC contributes a chunk-wise compression mechanism combined with layer-wise adaptive pruning. It condenses long-context multimodal inputs into compact, task-specific memory representations. By adaptively pruning tokens at each layer under a Jensen-Shannon divergence constraint, our method achieves a dramatic reduction in inference complexity without sacrificing performance. This approach is the first to seamlessly integrate compression and pruning techniques for multi-modal long-context learning, offering a scalable and efficient solution for real-world applications. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that EMLoC achieves performance on par with or superior to naive long-context approaches. Our results highlight the potential of EMLoC as a groundbreaking framework for efficient and flexible adaptation of multi-modal models in resource-constrained environments. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/EMLoC.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |

However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to DAFx 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the Avengers--a simple recipe that effectively leverages the collective intelligence of open-source, smaller language models. Our framework is built upon four lightweight operations: (i) embedding: encode queries using a text embedding model; (ii) clustering: group queries based on their semantic similarity; (iii) scoring: scores each model's performance within each cluster; and (iv) voting: improve outputs via repeated sampling and voting. At inference time, each query is embedded and assigned to its nearest cluster. The top-performing model(s) within that cluster are selected to generate the response using the Self-Consistency or its multi-model variant. Remarkably, with 10 open-source models (~7B parameters each), the Avengers collectively outperforms GPT-4.1 on 10 out of 15 datasets (spanning mathematics, code, logic, knowledge, and affective tasks). In particular, it surpasses GPT-4.1 on mathematics tasks by 18.21% and on code tasks by 7.46%. Furthermore, the Avengers delivers superior out-of-distribution generalization, and remains robust across various embedding models, clustering algorithms, ensemble strategies, and values of its sole parameter--the number of clusters.

Existing approaches often rely on heuristic-based tuning or exhaustive evaluation, which can be computationally expensive and suboptimal. This paper proposes Agentic Predictor, a lightweight predictor for efficient agentic workflow evaluation. Agentic Predictor is equipped with a multi-view workflow encoding technique that leverages multi-view representation learning of agentic systems by incorporating code architecture, textual prompts, and interaction graph features. To achieve high predictive accuracy while significantly reducing the number of required workflow evaluations for training a predictor, Agentic Predictor employs cross-domain unsupervised pretraining. By learning to approximate task success rates, Agentic Predictor enables fast and accurate selection of optimal agentic workflow configurations for a given task, significantly reducing the need for expensive trial-and-error evaluations. Experiments on a carefully curated benchmark spanning three domains show that our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and workflow utility, highlighting the potential of performance predictors in streamlining the design of LLM-based agentic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be available at https://github.com/DeepAuto-AI/agentic-predictor</p></details> |

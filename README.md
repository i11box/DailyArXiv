| **[LightSwitch: Multi-view Relighting with Material-guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06494v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless, generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project page & Code: https://yehonathanlitman.github.io/light_switch/</p></details> |
| **[Effective Training Data Synthesis for Improving MLLM Chart Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06492v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer (QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring 250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at: https://github.com/yuweiyang-anu/ECD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (poster). 26 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[LaDi-WM: A Latent Diffusion-based World Model for Predictive Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11528v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive manipulation has recently gained considerable attention in the Embodied AI community due to its potential to improve robot policy performance by leveraging predicted states. However, generating accurate future visual states of robot-object interactions from world models remains a well-known challenge, particularly in achieving high-quality pixel-level representations. To this end, we propose LaDi-WM, a world model that predicts the latent space of future states using diffusion modeling. Specifically, LaDi-WM leverages the well-established latent space aligned with pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which comprises both geometric features (DINO-based) and semantic features (CLIP-based). We find that predicting the evolution of the latent space is easier to learn and more generalizable than directly predicting pixel-level images. Building on LaDi-WM, we design a diffusion policy that iteratively refines output actions by incorporating forecasted states, thereby generating more consistent and accurate results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that LaDi-WM significantly enhances policy performance by 27.9\% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark and 20\% on the real-world scenario. Furthermore, our world model and policies achieve impressive generalizability in real-world experiments.</p></details> | CoRL 2025 |
| **[Self-Steering Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07081v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While test-time reasoning enables language models (LMs) to tackle complex tasks, searching or planning in natural language can be slow, costly, and error-prone. But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for "self-steering" LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B or Qwen3-1.7B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. Our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Test-Time Scaling Improve World Foundation Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24320v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World foundation models, which simulate the physical world by predicting future states from current observations and inputs, have become central to many applications in physical intelligence, including autonomous driving and robotics. However, these models require substantial computational resources for pretraining and are further constrained by available data during post-training. As such, scaling computation at test time emerges as both a critical and practical alternative to traditional model enlargement or re-training. In this work, we introduce SWIFT, a test-time scaling framework tailored for WFMs. SWIFT integrates our extensible WFM evaluation toolkit with process-level inference strategies, including fast tokenization, probability-based Top-K pruning, and efficient beam search. Empirical results on the COSMOS model demonstrate that test-time scaling exists even in a compute-optimal way. Our findings reveal that test-time scaling laws hold for WFMs and that SWIFT provides a scalable and effective pathway for improving WFM inference without retraining or increasing model size.

| **[Generative Video Bi-flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06364v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel generative video model to robustly learn temporal change as a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) flow with a bilinear objective which combines two aspects: The first is to map from the past into future video frames directly. Previous work has mapped the noise to new frames, a more computationally expensive process. Unfortunately, starting from the previous frame, instead of noise, is more prone to drifting errors. Hence, second, we additionally learn how to remove the accumulated errors as the joint objective by adding noise during training. We demonstrate unconditional video generation in a streaming manner for various video datasets, all at competitive quality compared to a conditional diffusion baseline but with higher speed, i.e., fewer ODE solver steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Non-programmers Assessing AI-Generated Code: A Case Study of Business Users Analyzing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06484v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-technical end-users increasingly rely on AI code generation to perform technical tasks like data analysis. However, large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable, and it is unclear whether end-users can effectively identify model errors $\unicode{x2014}$ especially in realistic and domain-specific scenarios. We surveyed marketing and sales professionals to assess their ability to critically evaluate LLM-generated analyses of marketing data. Participants were shown natural language explanations of the AI's code, repeatedly informed the AI often makes mistakes, and explicitly prompted to identify them. Yet, participants frequently failed to detect critical flaws that could compromise decision-making, many of which required no technical knowledge to recognize. To investigate why, we reformatted AI responses into clearly delineated steps and provided alternative approaches for each decision to support critical evaluation. While these changes had a positive effect, participants often struggled to reason through the AI's steps and alternatives. Our findings suggest that business professionals cannot reliably verify AI-generated data analyses on their own and explore reasons why to inform future designs. As non-programmers adopt code-generating AI for technical tasks, unreliable AI and insufficient human oversight poses risks of unsafe or low-quality decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VL/HCC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Post-training for Efficient Communication via Convention Formation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06482v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans communicate with increasing efficiency in multi-turn interactions, by adapting their language and forming ad-hoc conventions. In contrast, prior work shows that LLMs do not naturally show this behavior. We develop a post-training process to develop this ability through targeted fine-tuning on heuristically identified demonstrations of convention formation. We evaluate with two new benchmarks focused on this capability. First, we design a focused, cognitively-motivated interaction benchmark that consistently elicits strong convention formation trends in humans. Second, we create a new document-grounded reference completion task that reflects in-the-wild convention formation behavior. Our studies show significantly improved convention formation abilities in post-trained LLMs across the two evaluation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Problem of Atypicality in LLM-Powered Psychiatry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06479v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as scalable solutions to the global mental health crisis. But their deployment in psychiatric contexts raises a distinctive ethical concern: the problem of atypicality. Because LLMs generate outputs based on population-level statistical regularities, their responses -- while typically appropriate for general users -- may be dangerously inappropriate when interpreted by psychiatric patients, who often exhibit atypical cognitive or interpretive patterns. We argue that standard mitigation strategies, such as prompt engineering or fine-tuning, are insufficient to resolve this structural risk. Instead, we propose dynamic contextual certification (DCC): a staged, reversible and context-sensitive framework for deploying LLMs in psychiatry, inspired by clinical translation and dynamic safety models from artificial intelligence governance. DCC reframes chatbot deployment as an ongoing epistemic and ethical process that prioritises interpretive safety over static performance benchmarks. Atypicality, we argue, cannot be eliminated -- but it can, and must, be proactively managed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of 8/8/2025 -- please cite published version.

| **[Crop Pest Classification Using Deep Learning Techniques: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01494v3)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Insect pests continue to bring a serious threat to crop yields around the world, and traditional methods for monitoring them are often slow, manual, and difficult to scale. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles. Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for AI-based pest monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version adds co-authors who were unintentionally left out of the prior submission.

| **[An Online Multi-dimensional Knapsack Approach for Slice Admission Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06468v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network Slicing has emerged as a powerful technique to enable cost-effective, multi-tenant communications and services over a shared physical mobile network infrastructure. One major challenge of service provisioning in slice-enabled networks is the uncertainty in the demand for the limited network resources that must be shared among existing slices and potentially new Network Slice Requests. In this paper, we consider admission control of Network Slice Requests in an online setting, with the goal of maximizing the long-term revenue received from admitted requests. We model the Slice Admission Control problem as an Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problem and present two reservation-based policies and their algorithms, which have a competitive performance for Online Multidimensional Knapsack Problems. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the performance of our online admission control method in terms of average revenue gained by the Infrastructure Provider, system resource utilization, and the ratio of accepted slice requests. We compare our approach with those of the online First Come First Serve greedy policy. The simulation's results prove that our proposed online policies increase revenues for Infrastructure Providers by up to 12.9 % while reducing the average resource consumption by up to 1.7% In particular, when the tenants' economic inequality increases, an Infrastructure Provider who adopts our proposed online admission policies gains higher revenues compared to an Infrastructure Provider who adopts First Come First Serve.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 20th Consumer Communications & Networking Conference (CCNC)</p></details> |
| **[LLM Unlearning using Gradient Ratio-Based Influence Estimation and Noise Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06467v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing legal and ethical scrutiny of large language models (LLMs) necessitates effective machine unlearning, particularly for sensitive or unauthorized data. Existing empirical methods often yield incomplete forgetting or unintended degradation of unrelated knowledge due to poor localization. In this work, we propose GRIN: a modular and targeted framework for LLM unlearning. GRIN introduces a novel gradient-ratio-based metric to identify parameters most responsible for memorizing forget data. We then perform selective noise injection into these parameters prior to fine-tuning, which improves unlearning performance while maintaining model utility. Finally, we propose new evaluation metrics tailored to the LLM setting and validate our approach on standard benchmarks such as TOFU, WMDP, and SafePKU.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 3 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[ScamAgents: How AI Agents Can Simulate Human-Level Scam Calls](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06457v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CAMLIS 25: Conference on Applied Machine Learning for Information Security. 10 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Diffusion Models are Medical Image Classifiers that Provide Explainability and Uncertainty for Free](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03687v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts.

| **[eSASRec: Enhancing Transformer-based Recommendations in a Modular Fashion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06450v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since their introduction, Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and BERT4Rec, have become common baselines for sequential recommendations, surpassing earlier neural and non-neural methods. A number of following publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers, using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions. However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper. Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU), we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source implementations for our models and benchmarks in repository https://github.com/blondered/transformer_benchmark</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM RecSys 2025</p></details> |
| **[CRUST-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for C-to-safe-Rust Transpilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15254v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety.

This systematic review explores parallelization strategies that can address these challenges. We first propose a classification scheme for linear energy system optimization models, covering their analytical focus, mathematical structure, and scope. We then review parallel decomposition methods, finding that while many offer performance benefits, no single approach is universally superior. The lack of standardized benchmark suites further complicates comparison. To address this, we recommend essential criteria for future benchmarks and minimum reporting standards. We also survey available software tools for parallel decomposition, including modular frameworks and algorithmic abstractions. Though centered on energy system models, our insights extend to the broader operations research field.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate strategies to endow agents with a learnable, updatable, and lifelong procedural memory. We propose Memp that distills past agent trajectories into both fine-grained, step-by-step instructions and higher-level, script-like abstractions, and explore the impact of different strategies for Build, Retrieval, and Update of procedural memory. Coupled with a dynamic regimen that continuously updates, corrects, and deprecates its contents, this repository evolves in lockstep with new experience. Empirical evaluation on TravelPlanner and ALFWorld shows that as the memory repository is refined, agents achieve steadily higher success rates and greater efficiency on analogous tasks. Moreover, procedural memory built from a stronger model retains its value: migrating the procedural memory to a weaker model yields substantial performance gains.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Existing safety measures often detect overt malicious intent but fail to address subtle, reasoning-driven vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce POATE (Polar Opposite query generation, Adversarial Template construction, and Elaboration), a novel jailbreak technique that harnesses contrastive reasoning to provoke unethical responses. POATE crafts semantically opposing intents and integrates them with adversarial templates, steering models toward harmful outputs with remarkable subtlety. We conduct extensive evaluation across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods. To counter this, we propose Intent-Aware CoT and Reverse Thinking CoT, which decompose queries to detect malicious intent and reason in reverse to evaluate and reject harmful responses. These methods enhance reasoning robustness and strengthen the model's defense against adversarial exploits.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-poate-attack</p></details> |

These engines demonstrate remarkable performance in low-precision matrix multiplication, which is crucial in deep learning. Several techniques have been proposed to emulate single- and double-precision general matrix-matrix multiplication (SGEMM and DGEMM, respectively) by leveraging such low-precision matrix engines. In this study, we present emulation methods that significantly outperforms conventional approaches. On a GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, the proposed DGEMM emulation achieves a 1.4x speedup and a 43% improvement in power efficiency compared to native DGEMM for sufficiently large problems. The proposed SGEMM emulation achieves a 3.0x speedup and a 154% improvement in power efficiency compared to native SGEMM for sufficiently large problems. Furthermore, compared to conventional emulation methods, the proposed emulation achieves more than 2x higher performance and superior power efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

This framework is built upon the Quon language, a 2+1D topological quantum field theory with space-time boundary and defects. Its exponential computation complexity is captured by Magic holes, a topological feature capturing the global long-range entanglement. Both Clifford circuits and Matchgate circuits are free of Magic holes.

Statistical Coherence Alignment is introduced as a method to enforce structured token representations through tensor field convergence, guiding embeddings to reflect statistical dependencies inherent in linguistic data.

| **[Dimensional Characterization and Pathway Modeling for Catastrophic AI Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06411v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although discourse around the risks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown, it often lacks a comprehensive, multidimensional framework, and concrete causal pathways mapping hazard to harm. This paper aims to bridge this gap by examining six commonly discussed AI catastrophic risks: CBRN, cyber offense, sudden loss of control, gradual loss of control, environmental risk, and geopolitical risk. First, we characterize these risks across seven key dimensions, namely intent, competency, entity, polarity, linearity, reach, and order. Next, we conduct risk pathway modeling by mapping step-by-step progressions from the initial hazard to the resulting harms. The dimensional approach supports systematic risk identification and generalizable mitigation strategies, while risk pathway models help identify scenario-specific interventions. Together, these methods offer a more structured and actionable foundation for managing catastrophic AI risks across the value chain.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages including references, 6 figures.

In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful solution, with techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and hybrid models gaining popularity for automating pest detection. This review looks at 37 carefully selected studies published between 2018 and 2025, all focused on AI-based pest classification. The selected research is organized by crop type, pest species, model architecture, dataset usage, and key technical challenges. The early studies relied heavily on CNNs but latest work is shifting toward hybrid and transformer-based models that deliver higher accuracy and better contextual understanding. Still, challenges like imbalanced datasets, difficulty in detecting small pests, limited generalizability, and deployment on edge devices remain significant hurdles. Overall, this review offers a structured overview of the field, highlights useful datasets, and outlines the key challenges and future directions for AI-based pest monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version adds co-authors who were unintentionally left out of the prior submission.

In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational deception powered by generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CAMLIS 25: Conference on Applied Machine Learning for Information Security. 10 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

A number of following publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers, using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions. However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper. Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU), we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source implementations for our models and benchmarks in repository https://github.com/blondered/transformer_benchmark</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM RecSys 2025</p></details> |

The introduction of Structural Embedding Projection (SEP) provides a mechanism for refining token representations through projection matrices that integrate hierarchical and relational dependencies. The mathematical formulation of SEP enables embedding spaces to capture structured contextual relationships, thereby improving semantic fidelity without significantly increasing computational overhead. Experimental evaluations conducted on a range of linguistic datasets revealed that SEP contributed to reductions in perplexity and enhanced contextual coherence, demonstrating its potential to refine language model outputs. Computational efficiency assessments highlighted variations across different datasets, suggesting that the integration of structured embeddings introduced dataset-dependent trade-offs between inference speed and representational richness. The qualitative analysis of generated responses indicated that SEP enhanced narrative consistency and topic alignment, leading to improved fluency in multi-sentence text generation. The modifications to embedding layers required precise optimization to ensure stable training dynamics, as the introduction of structured transformations altered the traditional representation-learning process. The architectural adjustments necessary for SEP implementation influenced inference latency and memory consumption, requiring a balance between efficiency gains and additional processing demands. The impact of SEP on lexical diversity suggested that embedding modifications influenced the model's vocabulary usage, reflecting a more context-aware selection of generated tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

| **[Structured Convergence in Large Language Model Representations via Hierarchical Latent Space Folding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08947v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token representations in high-dimensional latent spaces often exhibit redundancy, limiting computational efficiency and reducing structural coherence across model layers. Hierarchical latent space folding introduces a structured transformation mechanism that enforces a multi-scale organization within learned embeddings, refining representational compactness while preserving essential contextual distinctions. The proposed approach incorporates dynamic folding operations that iteratively adjust token embeddings through structured transformations, influencing both short-range and long-range dependencies in sequential processing tasks. Empirical evaluation demonstrates a reduction in representational variance across layers, contributing to more stable perplexity distributions and enhancing predictive confidence in text generation. The structured redistribution of attention head utilization leads to more efficient allocation of computational resources, particularly in deeper layers, where hierarchical refinements improve contextual abstraction. Comparative analysis of activation sparsity patterns suggests that hierarchical adjustments selectively reinforce critical pathways while reducing computational overhead in non-essential regions of the model. Statistical assessments of token reordering frequencies reveal that hierarchical modifications introduce subtle shifts in sequential dependencies, improving contextual alignment while maintaining syntactic correctness. Computational trade-offs associated with hierarchical folding introduce marginal increases in training time per epoch, yet empirical findings indicate that inference efficiency benefits from the structured representation adjustments. The results highlight the impact of hierarchical latent space folding on optimizing model performance through improved representation structuring and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

A novel mechanism based on contextual reinforcement is introduced, dynamically adjusting token importance through interdependencies and semantic relevance. This approach enables substantial reductions in token usage while preserving the quality and coherence of information representation.

Autonomous structural memory manipulation further advances this paradigm through dynamic memory reallocation mechanisms that prioritize critical contextual features while suppressing less relevant information, enabling scalable and efficient performance across diverse tasks. Experimental results reveal substantial improvements in computational efficiency, with marked reductions in processing overhead for longer input sequences, achieved through memory reorganization strategies that adapt to evolving contextual requirements. Hierarchical embeddings not only improved contextual alignment but also facilitated task generalization by capturing relationships at varying semantic granularities, ensuring coherence across layers without introducing significant computational redundancies. Comparative analysis against baseline models demonstrated unique advantages in accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, particularly in tasks requiring complex contextual understanding or domain-specific adaptability. The ability to dynamically adjust token representations and memory configurations contributed to the model's robustness under varied and unpredictable input conditions. Applications benefiting from these advancements include multi-domain generalization, interactive systems, and scenarios involving real-time decision-making, where traditional static memory architectures often face limitations. The proposed methodology combines advanced embedding and memory management strategies into a cohesive framework that addresses scalability challenges while preserving task-specific relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

A transition framework was proposed in which each token embedding evolved through probabilistic updates, ensuring adaptability while preserving semantic integrity across linguistic contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that models incorporating stochastic transitions exhibited greater lexical diversity, improved generative coherence, and enhanced retention of low-frequency vocabulary, contributing to more varied sentence structures and reduced reliance on high-probability token selections. Statistical analyses of embedding drift across transformer layers indicated that representations evolved more flexibly without losing coherence, supporting the hypothesis that controlled stochasticity facilitated context-sensitive representation learning. Experimental results revealed that probabilistic embeddings introduced minor computational overhead while maintaining generative efficiency, reinforcing their feasibility in large-scale applications. A comparative study with traditional embedding approaches highlighted measurable gains in text completion accuracy, dialogue coherence, and structural complexity, confirming the effectiveness of stochastic transitions in enhancing representation expressiveness. Clustering patterns in the embedding space suggested that probabilistic updates preserved meaningful semantic groupings while enabling context-driven shifts, further validating the stability of the transition mechanism. Performance metrics indicated that stochastic transitions balanced adaptability and control, ensuring that generative outputs remained linguistically coherent without excessive randomness.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

By treating gradients as dynamic carriers of contextual dependencies rather than isolated numerical entities, the proposed methodology bridges critical gaps in existing optimization strategies. The integration of entangled gradient dynamics into a loss regularization framework demonstrated significant improvements in tasks involving long-form reasoning, contextual retention, and adaptability to unseen domains. Experimental evaluations showed that the CEGM-enhanced model consistently outperformed baseline approaches, achieving higher accuracy in token-level predictions and greater resilience to noisy inputs. Practical implementations involved modifications to training pipelines, introducing entanglement layers and dynamic coefficient adjustments that seamlessly align with existing architectures. Results further highlighted reductions in semantic drift during sequential transformations and improvements in embedding coherence across paraphrased sentences, showing the robustness and versatility of the proposed methodology.

The proposed Zero-Space Detection framework introduces a novel approach that dynamically identifies latent behavioral patterns through unsupervised clustering and advanced deep learning techniques. Designed to address the limitations of signature-based and heuristic methods, it operates effectively in high-velocity environments by integrating multi-phase filtering and ensemble learning for refined decision-making.

| **[Exploring Synaptic Resonance in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Contextual Memory Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10699v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual memory integration remains a high challenge in the development of language models, particularly in tasks that require maintaining coherence over extended sequences. Traditional approaches, such as self-attention mechanisms and memory-augmented architectures, often prioritize short-term dependencies, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency in long-range contextual understanding. Inspired by principles of synaptic plasticity observed in biological neural systems, a novel mechanism, Synaptic Resonance, is introduced to dynamically reinforce relevant memory pathways during training and inference. Unlike static memory representations, this mechanism continuously adjusts synaptic weight matrices based on contextual relevance, allowing for improved information retention without excessive computational overhead. Evaluations conducted on an open-source language model demonstrate reductions in perplexity, enhancements in contextual coherence, and increased robustness against input noise, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven memory modulation. Comparative analysis against baseline models further reveals that the proposed approach achieves higher memory retention efficiency while maintaining computational feasibility. The architectural modifications integrate seamlessly into existing transformer-based frameworks, ensuring stable convergence and efficient inference without sacrificing scalability. Applications benefiting from improved long-term contextual consistency, such as dialogue systems and document summarization, stand to gain from this approach. Empirical findings suggest that dynamically reinforced memory pathways offer a promising alternative to conventional memory mechanisms, addressing longstanding limitations in extended sequence modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[When AIOps Become "AI Oops": Subverting LLM-driven IT Operations via Telemetry Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06394v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI for IT Operations (AIOps) is transforming how organizations manage complex software systems by automating anomaly detection, incident diagnosis, and remediation. Modern AIOps solutions increasingly rely on autonomous LLM-based agents to interpret telemetry data and take corrective actions with minimal human intervention, promising faster response times and operational cost savings. In this work, we perform the first security analysis of AIOps solutions, showing that, once again, AI-driven automation comes with a profound security cost. We demonstrate that adversaries can manipulate system telemetry to mislead AIOps agents into taking actions that compromise the integrity of the infrastructure they manage. We introduce techniques to reliably inject telemetry data using error-inducing requests that influence agent behavior through a form of adversarial reward-hacking; plausible but incorrect system error interpretations that steer the agent's decision-making. Our attack methodology, AIOpsDoom, is fully automated--combining reconnaissance, fuzzing, and LLM-driven adversarial input generation--and operates without any prior knowledge of the target system. To counter this threat, we propose AIOpsShield, a defense mechanism that sanitizes telemetry data by exploiting its structured nature and the minimal role of user-generated content. Our experiments show that AIOpsShield reliably blocks telemetry-based attacks without affecting normal agent performance. Ultimately, this work exposes AIOps as an emerging attack vector for system compromise and underscores the urgent need for security-aware AIOps design.</p></details> | v0.1 |

Not all methods will succeed for a given problem, and when several do, the results, though mathematically equivalent, can differ greatly in presentation complexity. Traditionally, this choice has been made with minimal consideration of the problem instance, leading to inefficiencies. We present a machine learning (ML) approach using tree-based deep learning models within a two-stage architecture: first identifying applicable methods for a given instance, then ranking them by predicted output complexity. Furthermore, we find representing mathematical expressions as tree structures significantly improves performance over sequence-based representations, and our two-stage framework outperforms alternative ML formulations. Using a diverse dataset generated by six distinct data generators, our models achieve nearly 90% accuracy in selecting the optimal method on a 70,000 example holdout test set. On an independent out-of-distribution benchmark from Maple's internal test suite, our tree transformer model maintains strong generalisation, outperforming Maple's built-in selector and prior ML approaches. These results highlight the critical role of data representation and problem framing in ML for symbolic computation, and we expect our methodology to generalise effectively to similar optimisation problems in mathematical software.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables, submitted to Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)</p></details> |

While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 20 pages,9 figuers |

These quasi-periodic solutions stay on some invariant tori governed by complex PDEs in hyper-time. Here, we propose a Fourier series expansion-based shooting method (FSE-Shooting) for the parallelized computation of quasi-periodic solution with $d$ base frequencies ($d \ge 2$). We represent the associated $d$-torus as a collection of trajectories initialized at a ($d-1$)-torus. We drive a set of ODEs that hold for any of these trajectories. We also derive a set of boundary conditions that couple the initial and terminal states of these trajectories and then formulate a set of nonlinear algebraic equations via the coupling conditions. We use Fourier series expansion to parameterize the ($d-1$)-torus and shooting method to iterate the Fourier coefficients associated with initial torus such that the coupling conditions are satisfied. In particular, the terminal points of these trajectories are parallelized computed via Newmark integration, where the time points and Fourier coefficients are transformed to each other by alternating Frequency-Time method. A straightforward phase condition is devised to track the quasi-periodic solutions with priori unknown base frequencies. Additionally, the by-product of the FSE-Shooting can be also directly used to compute the Lyapunov exponents to assess the stabilities of quasi-periodic solutions. The results of three finite element systems show the efficiency and versatility of FSE-Shooting in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems, including a three-dimensional shell structure with $1872$ DOFs.</p></details> | 49 pages, 23 figures |

This has resulted in a significant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and scalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically examines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression strategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention compression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application scenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact on memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations and challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different models and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research directions, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic strategies, and software-hardware co-design.

This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on IR from speech by elderly German speakers. We propose a novel approach that combines an adapted Whisper ASR model, fine-tuned on elderly German speech (SVC-de), with Transformer-based language models trained on synthetic text datasets generated by three well-known large language models (LLMs): LeoLM, Llama3, and ChatGPT. To evaluate the robustness of our approach, we generate synthetic speech with a text-to-speech model and conduct extensive cross-dataset testing. Our results show that synthetic LLM-generated data significantly boosts classification performance and robustness to different speaking styles and unseen vocabulary. Notably, we find that LeoLM, a smaller, domain-specific 13B LLM, surpasses the much larger ChatGPT (175B) in dataset quality for German intent recognition. Our approach demonstrates that generative AI can effectively bridge data gaps in low-resource domains.

We interpret neural network layers as graph-based transformations, where neurons act as pairwise functions between inputs and learned anchor points. Within this formulation, we establish conditions under which layer outputs are sufficient for the layer inputs, that is, each layer preserves the conditional distribution of the target variable given the input variable. We explore two theoretical paths under this graph-based view. The first path assumes dense anchor points and shows that asymptotic sufficiency holds in the infinite-width limit and is preserved throughout training. The second path, more aligned with practical architectures, proves exact or approximate sufficiency in finite-width networks by assuming region-separated input distributions and constructing appropriate anchor points. This path can ensure the sufficiency property for an infinite number of layers, and provide error bounds on the optimal loss for both regression and classification tasks using standard neural networks. Our framework covers fully connected layers, general pairwise functions, ReLU and sigmoid activations, and convolutional neural networks. Overall, this work bridges statistical sufficiency, graph-theoretic representations, and deep learning, providing a new statistical understanding of neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages main + 10 pages appendix, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification. Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer (TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module (EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic segmentation.</p></details> | Submitted to GRSL |

Recent work by Kadekodi et al. demonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can lead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such adaptations, known as \emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of \emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes of different parameters. In this work, we study the setting in which $\lambda$ codewords of an initial $[n^I = k^I + r^I,\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a final $[n^F = \lambda k^I + r^F,\, k^F = \lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by presenting three constructions that achieve optimal \emph{access cost}, defined as the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first two constructions apply when $\lambda \leq r^I$ and impose specific divisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize both the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which builds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting arbitrary parameter regimes. All three constructions require field sizes that are linear in the final code length, and notably, the third construction achieves a field size that matches the lower bound implied by the MDS conjecture in almost all cases. In addition, we propose a construction that optimizes the \emph{bandwidth cost}, defined as the total number of symbols transmitted during conversion. This scheme is a refinement of Maturana and Rashmi's bandwidth-optimal construction based on the piggybacking framework, and achieves reduced sub-packetization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

Each party privately transforms its data using a secret linear basis and shares only the resulting intermediate representations. Existing theory asserts that any target basis spanning the same subspace as the secret bases should suffice; however, empirical evidence reveals that the particular choice of target basis significantly influences model accuracy and stability. In this paper, we introduce Orthonormal Data Collaboration (ODC), a novel DC framework that explicitly enforces orthonormality constraints on both the secret and target bases. Under these constraints, the basis alignment step reduces precisely to the classical Orthogonal Procrustes Problem, admitting a closed-form solution. We rigorously establish that the resulting orthonormal change-of-basis matrices achieve orthogonal concordance, aligning all parties' intermediate representations up to a common orthogonal transformation. Consequently, downstream model performance becomes invariant to the specific choice of orthonormal target basis. Computationally, ODC substantially reduces alignment complexity from O(\min\{a,(cl)^2,a^2cl) to O(acl^2) where a denotes anchor data size, l the latent dimension, and c the number of collaborating parties. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm the theoretical advantages of ODC, demonstrating alignment speed-ups of up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art DC methods, alongside comparable or superior accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. ODC maintains robust privacy under the semi-honest threat model and requires only a single round of communication. These results establish ODC as a practically advantageous and computationally efficient enhancement to existing DC pipelines, particularly when orthonormal secret bases are naturally feasible.</p></details> | 16 pages |

To alleviate memory pressure, activation recomputation and data compression have been proposed as two major strategies. However, both approaches have limitations: recomputation introduces significant training overhead, while compression can lead to accuracy degradation and computational inefficiency when applied naively. In this paper, we propose Adacc, the first adaptive memory optimization framework that unifies activation recomputation and data compression to improve training efficiency for LLMs while preserving model accuracy. Unlike existing methods that apply static, rule-based strategies or rely solely on one technique, Adacc makes fine-grained, tensor-level decisions, dynamically selecting between recomputation, retention, and compression based on tensor characteristics and runtime hardware constraints. Adacc tackles three key challenges: (1) it introduces layer-specific compression algorithms that mitigate accuracy loss by accounting for outliers in LLM activations; (2) it employs a MILP-based scheduling policy to globally optimize memory strategies across layers; and (3) it integrates an adaptive policy evolution mechanism to update strategies during training in response to changing data distributions. Experimental results show that Adacc improves training throughput by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the baseline.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Departing from exact Bayesian inference, variational inference transforms the inference problem into an optimization problem by introducing variational sets. Building on a refined ``prior mass and testing'' framework, we derive general conditions on PDE operators and guarantee that variational posteriors achieve convergence rates matching those of the exact posterior under widely adopted variational families (Besov-type measures or mean-field families). Moreover, our results achieve minimax-optimal rates over $B^{\alpha}_{pp}$ classes, significantly outperforming the suboptimal rates of Gaussian priors (by a polynomial factor). As specific examples, two typical nonlinear inverse problems, the Darcy flow problems and the inverse potential problem for a subdiffusion equation, are investigated to validate our theory. Besides, we show that our convergence rates of ``prediction'' loss for these ``PDE-constrained regression problems'' are minimax optimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.18415</p></details> |
| **[Fewer Denoising Steps or Cheaper Per-Step Inference: Towards Compute-Optimal Diffusion Model Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06160v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps. Our code is available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/PostDiff.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural-Driven Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05397v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image editing typically relies on manual prompting, making it labor-intensive and inaccessible to individuals with limited motor control or language abilities. Leveraging recent advances in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and generative models, we propose LoongX, a hands-free image editing approach driven by multimodal neurophysiological signals. LoongX utilizes state-of-the-art diffusion models trained on a comprehensive dataset of 23,928 image editing pairs, each paired with synchronized electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), photoplethysmography (PPG), and head motion signals that capture user intent. To effectively address the heterogeneity of these signals, LoongX integrates two key modules. The cross-scale state space (CS3) module encodes informative modality-specific features. The dynamic gated fusion (DGF) module further aggregates these features into a unified latent space, which is then aligned with edit semantics via fine-tuning on a diffusion transformer (DiT). Additionally, we pre-train the encoders using contrastive learning to align cognitive states with semantic intentions from embedded natural language. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoongX achieves performance comparable to text-driven methods (CLIP-I: 0.6605 vs. 0.6558; DINO: 0.4812 vs. 0.4636) and outperforms them when neural signals are combined with speech (CLIP-T: 0.2588 vs. 0.2549). These results highlight the promise of neural-driven generative models in enabling accessible, intuitive image editing and open new directions for cognitive-driven creative technologies. Datasets and code will be released to support future work and foster progress in this emerging area.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Enhancing the Scalability of Classical Surrogates for Real-World Quantum Machine Learning Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06131v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum machine learning (QML) presents potential for early industrial adoption, yet limited access to quantum hardware remains a significant bottleneck for deployment of QML solutions. This work explores the use of classical surrogates to bypass this restriction, which is a technique that allows to build a lightweight classical representation of a (trained) quantum model, enabling to perform inference on entirely classical devices. We reveal prohibiting high computational demand associated with previously proposed methods for generating classical surrogates from quantum models, and propose an alternative pipeline enabling generation of classical surrogates at a larger scale than was previously possible. Previous methods required at least a high-performance computing (HPC) system for quantum models of below industrial scale (ca. 20 qubits), which raises questions about its practicality. We greatly minimize the redundancies of the previous approach, utilizing only a minute fraction of the resources previously needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real-world energy demand forecasting problem, conducting rigorous testing of performance and computation demand in both simulations and on quantum hardware. Our results indicate that our method achieves high accuracy on the testing dataset while its computational resource requirements scale linearly rather than exponentially. This work presents a lightweight approach to transform quantum solutions into classically deployable versions, facilitating faster integration of quantum technology in industrial settings. Furthermore, it can serve as a powerful research tool in search practical quantum advantage in an empirical setup.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SAM Encoder Breach by Adversarial Simplicial Complex Triggers Downstream Model Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06127v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications. Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative. Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex. Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,recived by ICCV2025</p></details> |

The algorithms investigated include the classical linear transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently, the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE can be a promising outlook for the current work.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[GMF-Drive: Gated Mamba Fusion with Spatial-Aware BEV Representation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06113v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical 3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component, demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Reducibility among NP-Hard graph problems and boundary classes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14553v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many NP-hard graph problems become easy for some classes of graphs. For example, coloring is easy for bipartite graphs, but NP-hard in general. So we can ask question like when does a hard problem become easy? What is the minimum substructure for which the problem remains hard? We use the notion of boundary classes to study such questions. In this paper, we introduce a method for transforming the boundary class of one NP-hard graph problem into a boundary class for another problem. If {\Pi} and {\Gamma} are two NP-hard graph problems where {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, we transform a boundary class of {\Pi} into a boundary class of {\Gamma}. More formally if {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, where the reduction satisfies certain conditions, then X is a boundary class of {\Pi} if and only if the image of X under the reduction is a boundary class of {\Gamma}. This gives us a relationship between boundary classes and reducibility among several NP-hard problems. To show the strength of our main result, we apply our theorem to obtain some previously unknown boundary classes for a few graph problems namely; vertex-cover, clique, traveling-salesperson, bounded-degree-spanning-tree, subgraph-isomorphism and clique-cover.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[MeanAudio: Fast and Faithful Text-to-Audio Generation with Mean Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06098v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in diffusion- and flow- based models have significantly advanced Text-to-Audio Generation (TTA). While achieving great synthesis quality and controllability, current TTA systems still suffer from slow inference speed, which significantly limits their practical applicability. This paper presents MeanAudio, a novel MeanFlow-based model tailored for fast and faithful text-to-audio generation. Built on a Flux-style latent transformer, MeanAudio regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling fast generation by mapping directly from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. By incorporating classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training target, MeanAudio incurs no additional cost in the guided sampling process. To further stabilize training, we propose an instantaneous-to-mean curriculum with flow field mix-up, which encourages the model to first learn the foundational instantaneous dynamics, and then gradually adapt to mean flows. This strategy proves critical for enhancing training efficiency and generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-step audio generation. Specifically, it achieves a real time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup over SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. Moreover, MeanAudio also demonstrates strong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth and coherent transitions across successive synthesis steps.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGKDD 2025</p></details> |

However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2% compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

These machines update their states simultaneously based on specific local rules that govern their interactions. This framework provides a simple yet powerful model for studying complex systems and emergent behaviors. We revisit and reconsider the traditional notion of an algorithm, proposing a novel perspective in which algorithms are represented through the dynamic state-space configurations of cellular automata. By doing so, we establish a conceptual framework that connects computation to physical processes in a unique and innovative way. This approach not only enhances our understanding of computation but also paves the way for the future development of unconventional computing devices. Such devices could be engineered to leverage the inherent computational capabilities of physical, chemical, and biological substrates. This opens up new possibilities for designing systems that are more efficient, adaptive, and capable of solving problems in ways that traditional silicon-based computers cannot. The integration of cellular automata into these domains highlights their potential as a transformative tool in the ongoing evolution of computational theory and practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 table, 6 figures</p></details> |

We describe spectral mapping at finite stages and identify the spectrum of the limit via the essential range. In reflexive Banach spaces, for Ritt or sectorial operators with a bounded H-infinity functional calculus, the composite layer is power-bounded and its mean-ergodic projection yields an idempotent commuting with the original operator; under a peripheral-separation condition the powers converge strongly to this projection.

However, deploying MoE models across heterogeneous end-cloud environments poses new challenges in expert scheduling, communication overhead, and resource heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose EC2MoE, an adaptive framework for scalable MoE inference via end-cloud pipeline collaboration. First, we design a hardware-aware lightweight group gate network that enhances expert selection and computational efficiency. By incorporating a hardware-aware local expert selection mechanism, the system adaptively filters candidate experts based on real-time device profiles. A lightweight group gate module then integrates local and global gating outputs to achieve high-quality expert routing with minimal overhead. Second, we develop a pipeline optimization mechanism based on endcloud collaboration to accelerate MoE inference. This includes an encoder-decoder structure based on low-rank compression, which reduces transmission and computation costs. And a route-aware heuristic pipeline scheduling algorithm that dynamically allocates inference stages across devices according to workload and network topology. Extensive experiments show that EC2MoE can increase throughput by 2.2x to 5.1x and reduce end-to-end latency by 53% to 67% while maintaining high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also maintains good scalability under dynamic load and network environments.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Nevertheless, generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project page & Code: https://yehonathanlitman.github.io/light_switch/</p></details> |

But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for "self-steering" LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B or Qwen3-1.7B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. Our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

However, these models require substantial computational resources for pretraining and are further constrained by available data during post-training. As such, scaling computation at test time emerges as both a critical and practical alternative to traditional model enlargement or re-training. In this work, we introduce SWIFT, a test-time scaling framework tailored for WFMs. SWIFT integrates our extensible WFM evaluation toolkit with process-level inference strategies, including fast tokenization, probability-based Top-K pruning, and efficient beam search. Empirical results on the COSMOS model demonstrate that test-time scaling exists even in a compute-optimal way. Our findings reveal that test-time scaling laws hold for WFMs and that SWIFT provides a scalable and effective pathway for improving WFM inference without retraining or increasing model size.

The introduction of Structural Embedding Projection (SEP) provides a mechanism for refining token representations through projection matrices that integrate hierarchical and relational dependencies. The mathematical formulation of SEP enables embedding spaces to capture structured contextual relationships, thereby improving semantic fidelity without significantly increasing computational overhead. Experimental evaluations conducted on a range of linguistic datasets revealed that SEP contributed to reductions in perplexity and enhanced contextual coherence, demonstrating its potential to refine language model outputs. Computational efficiency assessments highlighted variations across different datasets, suggesting that the integration of structured embeddings introduced dataset-dependent trade-offs between inference speed and representational richness. The qualitative analysis of generated responses indicated that SEP enhanced narrative consistency and topic alignment, leading to improved fluency in multi-sentence text generation. The modifications to embedding layers required precise optimization to ensure stable training dynamics, as the introduction of structured transformations altered the traditional representation-learning process. The architectural adjustments necessary for SEP implementation influenced inference latency and memory consumption, requiring a balance between efficiency gains and additional processing demands. The impact of SEP on lexical diversity suggested that embedding modifications influenced the model's vocabulary usage, reflecting a more context-aware selection of generated tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

The introduction of contextual morphogenesis establishes a self-organizing mechanism that restructures token boundaries based on learned contextual dependencies, allowing embeddings to evolve progressively across iterative processing steps. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that dynamically adjusted tokenization contributes to reductions in perplexity while maintaining representational stability, particularly in linguistically complex domains where static segmentation fails to capture nuanced dependencies. Computational trade-offs associated with self-organizing token structures indicate that additional processing overhead remains within feasible limits, provided that optimization strategies account for segmentation update efficiency. Comparative assessments across different linguistic corpora suggest that adaptive tokenization preserves interpretability while improving alignment with contextual cues, reinforcing the potential of morphogenetic segmentation mechanisms to refine predictive accuracy. Stability analyses confirm that evolving token structures maintain consistent segmentation behaviors across varied text distributions, ensuring that representational adaptations remain linguistically coherent. The effectiveness of contextual morphogenesis in refining structural stability and predictive performance highlights its viability as an alternative to traditional tokenization methods. Further analysis of computational efficiency considerations suggests that hybrid strategies integrating both static and dynamic segmentation techniques may offer a balanced approach to optimizing representational flexibility while maintaining inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Hierarchical latent space folding introduces a structured transformation mechanism that enforces a multi-scale organization within learned embeddings, refining representational compactness while preserving essential contextual distinctions. The proposed approach incorporates dynamic folding operations that iteratively adjust token embeddings through structured transformations, influencing both short-range and long-range dependencies in sequential processing tasks. Empirical evaluation demonstrates a reduction in representational variance across layers, contributing to more stable perplexity distributions and enhancing predictive confidence in text generation. The structured redistribution of attention head utilization leads to more efficient allocation of computational resources, particularly in deeper layers, where hierarchical refinements improve contextual abstraction. Comparative analysis of activation sparsity patterns suggests that hierarchical adjustments selectively reinforce critical pathways while reducing computational overhead in non-essential regions of the model. Statistical assessments of token reordering frequencies reveal that hierarchical modifications introduce subtle shifts in sequential dependencies, improving contextual alignment while maintaining syntactic correctness. Computational trade-offs associated with hierarchical folding introduce marginal increases in training time per epoch, yet empirical findings indicate that inference efficiency benefits from the structured representation adjustments. The results highlight the impact of hierarchical latent space folding on optimizing model performance through improved representation structuring and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[Latent Structure Modulation in Large Language Models Through Stochastic Concept Embedding Transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05553v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic embedding transitions introduce a probabilistic mechanism for adjusting token representations dynamically during inference, mitigating the constraints imposed through static or deterministic embeddings. A transition framework was proposed in which each token embedding evolved through probabilistic updates, ensuring adaptability while preserving semantic integrity across linguistic contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that models incorporating stochastic transitions exhibited greater lexical diversity, improved generative coherence, and enhanced retention of low-frequency vocabulary, contributing to more varied sentence structures and reduced reliance on high-probability token selections. Statistical analyses of embedding drift across transformer layers indicated that representations evolved more flexibly without losing coherence, supporting the hypothesis that controlled stochasticity facilitated context-sensitive representation learning. Experimental results revealed that probabilistic embeddings introduced minor computational overhead while maintaining generative efficiency, reinforcing their feasibility in large-scale applications. A comparative study with traditional embedding approaches highlighted measurable gains in text completion accuracy, dialogue coherence, and structural complexity, confirming the effectiveness of stochastic transitions in enhancing representation expressiveness. Clustering patterns in the embedding space suggested that probabilistic updates preserved meaningful semantic groupings while enabling context-driven shifts, further validating the stability of the transition mechanism. Performance metrics indicated that stochastic transitions balanced adaptability and control, ensuring that generative outputs remained linguistically coherent without excessive randomness.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Synaptic Resonance in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Contextual Memory Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10699v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual memory integration remains a high challenge in the development of language models, particularly in tasks that require maintaining coherence over extended sequences. Traditional approaches, such as self-attention mechanisms and memory-augmented architectures, often prioritize short-term dependencies, leading to fragmentation and inconsistency in long-range contextual understanding. Inspired by principles of synaptic plasticity observed in biological neural systems, a novel mechanism, Synaptic Resonance, is introduced to dynamically reinforce relevant memory pathways during training and inference. Unlike static memory representations, this mechanism continuously adjusts synaptic weight matrices based on contextual relevance, allowing for improved information retention without excessive computational overhead. Evaluations conducted on an open-source language model demonstrate reductions in perplexity, enhancements in contextual coherence, and increased robustness against input noise, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven memory modulation. Comparative analysis against baseline models further reveals that the proposed approach achieves higher memory retention efficiency while maintaining computational feasibility. The architectural modifications integrate seamlessly into existing transformer-based frameworks, ensuring stable convergence and efficient inference without sacrificing scalability. Applications benefiting from improved long-term contextual consistency, such as dialogue systems and document summarization, stand to gain from this approach. Empirical findings suggest that dynamically reinforced memory pathways offer a promising alternative to conventional memory mechanisms, addressing longstanding limitations in extended sequence modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

A model modified through this framework demonstrated improved perplexity scores, greater lexical variability, and enhanced consistency in logical reasoning, suggesting that structured parameter distribution contributes to more efficient language representation. Statistical analyses of generated text highlighted a wider range of sentence structures and reduced redundancy in token selection, indicating that encapsulation fosters more adaptable language generation. A detailed evaluation of attention weight distributions revealed that the experimental model exhibited greater divergence in cross-layer activations, supporting the hypothesis that encapsulated neurons assume specialized processing roles. Logical consistency assessments further demonstrated that modular architectures mitigate contradictory outputs, reducing internal conflicts in inferred relationships between linguistic constructs. Computational trade-offs were analyzed, with results showing a minor increase in processing overhead, though improvements in parameter efficiency and structured decision-making compensated for the additional complexity. The mathematical formulation of the encapsulation mechanism confirmed that modular aggregation maintains stable convergence properties while promoting distinct functional roles for different neuron clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

We argue that existing solutions, including recent lakehouse storage formats, have fundamental limitations and that there is a strong motivation for a specialized database engine, dedicated to serve as the catalog. We present the design and implementation of TreeCat, a database engine that features a hierarchical data model with a path-based query language, a storage format optimized for efficient range queries and versioning, and a correlated scan operation that enables fast query execution. A key performance challenge is supporting concurrent read and write operations from many different clients while providing strict consistency guarantees. To this end, we present a novel MVOCC (multi-versioned optimistic concurrency control) protocol that guarantees serializable isolation. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation comparing our concurrency control scheme with prior techniques, and evaluating our overall system against Hive Metastore, Delta Lake, and Iceberg.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at PVLDB Volume 18 (for VLDB 2025)</p></details> |

In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and RAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the CONFERENCE ON LANGUAGE MODELING (COLM) 2025</p></details> |

While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 20 pages,9 figuers |
| **[Introducing Fractional Classification Loss for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06346v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust loss functions are crucial for training deep neural networks in the presence of label noise, yet existing approaches require extensive, dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Fractional Classification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically calibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the active-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the Cross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that the fractional derivative order $\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that interpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence. Furthermore, we integrate $\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a learnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off between robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property establishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\mu$: lower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but impose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in them. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve effective classification performance under label noise. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that FCL achieves state-of-the-art results without the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, 2 table.

Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2025 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)</p></details> |
| **[ART: Adaptive Relation Tuning for Generalized Relation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23543v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships between objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained. While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations. We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations for segmenting complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, learning to map neural fields often requires large amounts of training data and computations, which can be limited to resource-constrained edge devices. One approach to tackle this limitation is to leverage Federated Meta-Learning (FML), but traditional FML approaches suffer from privacy leakage. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FML approach called FedMeNF. FedMeNF utilizes a new privacy-preserving loss function that regulates privacy leakage in the local meta-optimization. This enables the local meta-learner to optimize quickly and efficiently without retaining the client's private data. Our experiments demonstrate that FedMeNF achieves fast optimization speed and robust reconstruction performance, even with few-shot or non-IID data across diverse data modalities, while preserving client data privacy.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

This has resulted in a significant memory bottleneck, limiting the inference efficiency and scalability of the models. Therefore, optimizing the KV cache during inference is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. This review systematically examines current KV cache optimization techniques, including compression strategies such as selective token strategies, quantization, and attention compression. We evaluate the effectiveness, trade-offs, and application scenarios of these methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of their impact on memory usage and inference speed. We focus on identifying the limitations and challenges of existing methods, such as compatibility issues with different models and tasks. Additionally, this review highlights future research directions, including hybrid optimization techniques, adaptive dynamic strategies, and software-hardware co-design. These approaches aim to improve inference efficiency and promote the practical application of large language models.</p></details> | 12 pages |

One can introduce a non-constant diffusion matrix to precondition these dynamics, and recent works have optimized it in order to improve the rate of convergence to stationarity by overcoming entropic and energy barriers. However, the introduced methodologies to compute these optimal diffusions are generally not suited to high-dimensional settings, as they rely on costly optimization procedures. In this work, we propose to optimize over a class of diffusion matrices, based on one-dimensional collective variables (CVs), to help the dynamics explore the latent space defined by the CV. The form of the diffusion matrix is chosen in order to obtain an efficient effective diffusion in the latent space. We describe how this class of diffusion matrices can be constructed and learned during the simulation. We provide implementations of the Metropolis--Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Riemann Manifold (Generalized) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, and discuss numerical optimizations in the case when the CV depends only on a few degrees of freedom of the system. We illustrate the efficiency gains by computing mean transition durations between two metastable states of a dimer in a solvent.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional PET systems rely on complete detector rings for full angular coverage and reliable data collection. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. Standard reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation with these systems because of reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. We present a two-stage deep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF) information, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing coincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based methods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention U-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial context from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are reconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that removes residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206 brain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model successfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution features with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher inference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Recently, diffusion models have become a popular generative technique in this field with their strong generation capabilities. However, several challenges remain for diffusion-based methods: 1) inefficient inference and visual artifacts caused by the implicit latent space of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE), which complicates the diffusion process; 2) a lack of authentic facial expressions and head movements due to inadequate multi-modal information fusion. In this paper, MoDA handles these challenges by: 1) defining a joint parameter space that bridges motion generation and neural rendering, and leveraging flow matching to simplify diffusion learning; 2) introducing a multi-modal diffusion architecture to model the interaction among noisy motion, audio, and auxiliary conditions, enhancing overall facial expressiveness. In addition, a coarse-to-fine fusion strategy is employed to progressively integrate different modalities, ensuring effective feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MoDA improves video diversity, realism, and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.

Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

Existing weighting methods either assume positivity holds or produce effects that conflate interventions' impacts on ultimate outcomes with their effects on intermediate treatments and covariates. We propose a novel class of estimands -- cumulative cross-world weighted effects -- that weights potential outcome differences using propensity scores adapting to positivity violations cumulatively across timepoints and simultaneously across both counterfactual treatment histories. This new estimand isolates mechanistic differences between treatment regimes, is identifiable without positivity assumptions, and circumvents the limitations of existing longitudinal methods. Further, our analysis reveals two fundamental insights about longitudinal causal inference under positivity violations. First, while mechanistically meaningful, these effects correspond to non-implementable interventions, exposing a core interpretability-implementability tradeoff. Second, the identified effects faithfully capture mechanistic differences only under a partial common support assumption; violations cause the identified functional to collapse to zero, even when the causal effect is non-zero. We develop doubly robust-style estimators that achieve asymptotic normality and parametric convergence under nonparametric assumptions on the nuisance estimators. To this end, we reformulate challenging density ratio estimation as regression function estimation, which is achievable with standard machine learning methods. We illustrate our methods through analysis of union membership's effect on earnings.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2506.09188</p></details> |

However, the ability to perform causal inference -- a core aspect of human cognition -- remains underexplored, particularly in multimodal settings. In this study, we introduce InfoCausalQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate causal reasoning grounded in infographics that combine structured visual data with textual context. The benchmark comprises two tasks: Task 1 focuses on quantitative causal reasoning based on inferred numerical trends, while Task 2 targets semantic causal reasoning involving five types of causal relations: cause, effect, intervention, counterfactual, and temporal. We manually collected 494 infographic-text pairs from four public sources and used GPT-4o to generate 1,482 high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs. These questions were then carefully revised by humans to ensure they cannot be answered based on surface-level cues alone but instead require genuine visual grounding. Our experimental results reveal that current VLMs exhibit limited capability in computational reasoning and even more pronounced limitations in semantic causal reasoning. Their significantly lower performance compared to humans indicates a substantial gap in leveraging infographic-based information for causal inference. Through InfoCausalQA, we highlight the need for advancing the causal reasoning abilities of multimodal AI systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

However, VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii) the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client). To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and locally independent inference.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Departing from exact Bayesian inference, variational inference transforms the inference problem into an optimization problem by introducing variational sets. Building on a refined ``prior mass and testing'' framework, we derive general conditions on PDE operators and guarantee that variational posteriors achieve convergence rates matching those of the exact posterior under widely adopted variational families (Besov-type measures or mean-field families). Moreover, our results achieve minimax-optimal rates over $B^{\alpha}_{pp}$ classes, significantly outperforming the suboptimal rates of Gaussian priors (by a polynomial factor). As specific examples, two typical nonlinear inverse problems, the Darcy flow problems and the inverse potential problem for a subdiffusion equation, are investigated to validate our theory. Besides, we show that our convergence rates of ``prediction'' loss for these ``PDE-constrained regression problems'' are minimax optimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.18415</p></details> |
| **[Fewer Denoising Steps or Cheaper Per-Step Inference: Towards Compute-Optimal Diffusion Model Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06160v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning, is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff, a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of denoising steps.

The model characterizes linguistic processing as inference over a hierarchical generative model, facilitating predictions and inferences at various levels of granularity, from syllables to sentences. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models for realistic textual predictions and active inference for guiding eye movements to informative textual information, enabling the testing of predictions. The model exhibits proficiency in reading both known and unknown words and sentences, adhering to the distinction between lexical and nonlexical routes in dual route theories of reading. Our model therefore provides a novel approach to understand the cognitive processes underlying reading and eye movements, within a predictive processing framework. Furthermore, our model can potentially aid in understanding how maladaptive predictive processing can produce reading deficits associated with dyslexia. As a proof of concept, we show that attenuating the contribution of priors during the reading process leads to incorrect inferences and a more fragmented reading style, characterized by a greater number of shorter saccades, aligning with empirical findings regarding eye movements in dyslexic individuals. In summary, our model represents a significant advancement in comprehending the cognitive processes involved in reading and eye movements, with potential implications for understanding dyslexia in terms of maladaptive inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Document - 30 pages, 1 Table, 10 Figures + Supplementary 16 pages, 17 Tables</p></details> |

This work explores the use of classical surrogates to bypass this restriction, which is a technique that allows to build a lightweight classical representation of a (trained) quantum model, enabling to perform inference on entirely classical devices. We reveal prohibiting high computational demand associated with previously proposed methods for generating classical surrogates from quantum models, and propose an alternative pipeline enabling generation of classical surrogates at a larger scale than was previously possible. Previous methods required at least a high-performance computing (HPC) system for quantum models of below industrial scale (ca. 20 qubits), which raises questions about its practicality. We greatly minimize the redundancies of the previous approach, utilizing only a minute fraction of the resources previously needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real-world energy demand forecasting problem, conducting rigorous testing of performance and computation demand in both simulations and on quantum hardware.

| **[The Docking Game: Loop Self-Play for Fast, Dynamic, and Accurate Prediction of Flexible Protein-Ligand Binding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05006v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets. However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop, the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model. We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular docking in drug discovery.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 figures |

While achieving great synthesis quality and controllability, current TTA systems still suffer from slow inference speed, which significantly limits their practical applicability. This paper presents MeanAudio, a novel MeanFlow-based model tailored for fast and faithful text-to-audio generation. Built on a Flux-style latent transformer, MeanAudio regresses the average velocity field during training, enabling fast generation by mapping directly from the start to the endpoint of the flow trajectory. By incorporating classifier-free guidance (CFG) into the training target, MeanAudio incurs no additional cost in the guided sampling process. To further stabilize training, we propose an instantaneous-to-mean curriculum with flow field mix-up, which encourages the model to first learn the foundational instantaneous dynamics, and then gradually adapt to mean flows. This strategy proves critical for enhancing training efficiency and generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that MeanAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-step audio generation. Specifically, it achieves a real time factor (RTF) of 0.013 on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090, yielding a 100x speedup over SOTA diffusion-based TTA systems. Moreover, MeanAudio also demonstrates strong performance in multi-step generation, enabling smooth and coherent transitions across successive synthesis steps.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Bounding Distributional Shifts in World Modeling through Novelty Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06096v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data efficiency.</p></details> | 7 pages, 6 figures |
| **[General Seemingly Unrelated Local Projections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17105v3)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a Bayesian framework for the efficient estimation of impulse responses using Local Projections (LPs) with instrumental variables. It accommodates multiple shocks and instruments, accounts for autocorrelation in multi-step forecasts by jointly modeling all LPs as a seemingly unrelated system of equations, defines a flexible yet parsimonious joint prior for impulse responses based on a Gaussian Process, and allows for joint inference about the entire vector of impulse responses. We show via Monte Carlo simulations that our approach delivers more accurate point and uncertainty estimates than standard methods. To address potential misspecification, we propose an optional robustification step based on power posteriors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Local Projections, Impulse Responses, Instruments, Bayesian Methods, Gaussian Process; JEL: C11, C22, C26, E00</p></details> |
| **[Hypothesis-Driven Theory-of-Mind Reasoning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11881v2)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing LLM reasoning methods have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, such as solving math and coding problems. However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o3 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025.

| **[LLMs for Resource Allocation: A Participatory Budgeting Approach to Inferring Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06060v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to handle complex decision-making tasks, yet their ability to perform structured resource allocation remains underexplored. Evaluating their reasoning is also difficult due to data contamination and the static nature of existing benchmarks. We present a dual-purpose framework leveraging Participatory Budgeting (PB) both as (i) a practical setting for LLM-based resource allocation and (ii) an adaptive benchmark for evaluating their reasoning capabilities. We task LLMs with selecting project subsets under feasibility (e.g., budget) constraints via three prompting strategies: greedy selection, direct optimization, and a hill-climbing-inspired refinement. We benchmark LLMs' allocations against a utility-maximizing oracle. Interestingly, we also test whether LLMs can infer structured preferences from natural-language voter input or metadata, without explicit votes. By comparing allocations based on inferred preferences to those from ground-truth votes, we evaluate LLMs' ability to extract preferences from open-ended input. Our results underscore the role of prompt design and show that LLMs hold promise for mechanism design with unstructured inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Fourier-VLM: Compressing Vision Tokens in the Frequency Domain for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06038v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM). However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2% compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

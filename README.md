| **[FADRM: Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24125v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Residual connection has been extensively studied and widely applied at the model architecture level. However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%.

| **[Teaching Time Series to See and Speak: Forecasting with Aligned Visual and Textual Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24124v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting traditionally relies on unimodal numerical inputs, which often struggle to capture high-level semantic patterns due to their dense and unstructured nature. While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

| **[Calligrapher: Freestyle Text Image Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24123v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography, Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://calligrapher2025.github.io/Calligrapher Code: https://github.com/Calligrapher2025/Calligrapher</p></details> |
| **[SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24119v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Epona: Autoregressive Diffusion World Model for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24113v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional visual quality in video generation, making them promising for autonomous driving world modeling. However, existing video diffusion-based world models struggle with flexible-length, long-horizon predictions and integrating trajectory planning. This is because conventional video diffusion models rely on global joint distribution modeling of fixed-length frame sequences rather than sequentially constructing localized distributions at each timestep. In this work, we propose Epona, an autoregressive diffusion world model that enables localized spatiotemporal distribution modeling through two key innovations: 1) Decoupled spatiotemporal factorization that separates temporal dynamics modeling from fine-grained future world generation, and 2) Modular trajectory and video prediction that seamlessly integrate motion planning with visual modeling in an end-to-end framework. Our architecture enables high-resolution, long-duration generation while introducing a novel chain-of-forward training strategy to address error accumulation in autoregressive loops. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% FVD improvement and minutes longer prediction duration compared to prior works. The learned world model further serves as a real-time motion planner, outperforming strong end-to-end planners on NAVSIM benchmarks.

| **[Navigating with Annealing Guidance Scale in Diffusion Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24108v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images conditioned on text prompts, yet their effectiveness heavily relies on careful guidance during the sampling process. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance/</p></details> |

While recent solutions leverage visualization, visual analytics, and user interaction, these systems rarely incorporate structured service design methodologies. Bridging service design with visual analytics and visualization can be valuable for the healthcare DT community. This paper aims to introduce the service design discipline to visualization researchers by framing this integration gap and suggesting research directions to enhance the real-world applicability of DT solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to: Workshop on Visual Analytics in Healthcare (VAHC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Accurate and lightweight dehazing via multi-receptive-field non-local network and novel contrastive regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16494v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning-based methods have dominated image dehazing domain. Although very competitive dehazing performance has been achieved with sophisticated models, effective solutions for extracting useful features are still under-explored. In addition, non-local network, which has made a breakthrough in many vision tasks, has not been appropriately applied to image dehazing. Thus, a multi-receptive-field non-local network (MRFNLN) consisting of the multi-stream feature attention block (MSFAB) and cross non-local block (CNLB) is presented in this paper. We start with extracting richer features for dehazing. Specifically, we design a multi-stream feature extraction (MSFE) sub-block, which contains three parallel convolutions with different receptive fields (i.e., $1\times 1$, $3\times 3$, $5\times 5$) for extracting multi-scale features. Following MSFE, we employ an attention sub-block to make the model adaptively focus on important channels/regions. The MSFE and attention sub-blocks constitute our MSFAB. Then, we design a cross non-local block (CNLB), which can capture long-range dependencies beyond the query. Instead of the same input source of query branch, the key and value branches are enhanced by fusing more preceding features. CNLB is computation-friendly by leveraging a spatial pyramid down-sampling (SPDS) strategy to reduce the computation and memory consumption without sacrificing the performance. Last but not least, a novel detail-focused contrastive regularization (DFCR) is presented by emphasizing the low-level details and ignoring the high-level semantic information in the representation space. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MRFNLN model outperforms recent state-of-the-art dehazing methods with less than 1.5 Million parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the IEEE Journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[DenseWorld-1M: Towards Detailed Dense Grounded Caption in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24102v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate a complex understanding of scenes, benefiting from large-scale and high-quality datasets. Most existing caption datasets lack the ground locations and relations for visual entities. Several grounded caption datasets face the problems of missing detailed descriptions, relations, and massive object descriptions on high-resolution images. To fill this gap for the community, we present DenseWorld-1M, the first massive, detailed, dense grounded caption dataset in the real world. We design a three-stage labeling pipeline, containing open-world perception, detailed object caption generation, and dense caption merging. The first stage obtains entity-level masks and labels. The second stage generates the object-level, detailed captions with the guidance of masks and labels from the first stage. The final stage merges object captions and masks into spatial and relational dense captions. To accelerate the labeling process and improve caption quality, we present two VLM models: the Detailed Region Caption model and the Spatial Caption Merging model. Extensive experiments on various settings, including vision-language understanding, visual grounding, and region caption generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our DenseWorld-1M dataset and labeling models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Datasets and Models: https://github.com/lxtGH/DenseWorld-1M</p></details> |
| **[Trust & Safety of LLMs and LLMs in Trust & Safety](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02113v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their widespread adoption has raised concerns pertaining to trust and safety. This systematic review investigates the current research landscape on trust and safety in LLMs, with a particular focus on the novel application of LLMs within the field of Trust and Safety itself. We delve into the complexities of utilizing LLMs in domains where maintaining trust and safety is paramount, offering a consolidated perspective on this emerging trend.\ By synthesizing findings from various studies, we identify key challenges and potential solutions, aiming to benefit researchers and practitioners seeking to understand the nuanced interplay between LLMs and Trust and Safety. This review provides insights on best practices for using LLMs in Trust and Safety, and explores emerging risks such as prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Ultimately, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how LLMs can be effectively and responsibly utilized to enhance trust and safety in the digital realm.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[MILo: Mesh-In-the-Loop Gaussian Splatting for Detailed and Efficient Surface Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24096v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have enabled fast reconstruction of high-quality 3D scenes from images, extracting accurate surface meshes remains a challenge. Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[SEUF: Is Unlearning One Expert Enough for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18797v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs--a key subset of the LLM family--have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL'25 |

To enable such models with high-fidelity human motion, two core challenges must be addressed. The first is the reconstruction gap between the continuous motion modality and discrete representation in an autoregressive manner, and the second is the degradation of language intelligence during unified training. Inspired by the mixture of experts, we propose MotionGPT3, a bimodal motion-language model that treats human motion as a second modality, decoupling motion modeling via separate model parameters and enabling both effective cross-modal interaction and efficient multimodal scaling training. To preserve language intelligence, the text branch retains the original structure and parameters of the pretrained language model, while a new motion branch is integrated via a shared attention mechanism, enabling bidirectional information flow between two modalities. We first employ a motion Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode raw human motion into latent representations. Based on this continuous latent space, the motion branch predicts motion latents directly from intermediate hidden states using a diffusion head, bypassing discrete tokenization. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves competitive performance on both motion understanding and generation tasks while preserving strong language capabilities, establishing a unified bimodal motion diffusion framework within an autoregressive manner.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is available at https://imagineforme.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper introduces C3VDv2, the second version (v2) of the high-definition Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset, featuring enhanced realism designed to facilitate the quantitative evaluation of 3D colon reconstruction algorithms. 192 video sequences were captured by imaging 60 unique, high-fidelity silicone colon phantom segments. Ground truth depth, surface normals, optical flow, occlusion, six-degree-of-freedom pose, coverage maps, and 3D models are provided for 169 colonoscopy videos. Eight simulated screening colonoscopy videos acquired by a gastroenterologist are provided with ground truth poses.

This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising 8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc., providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of 90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain.

In particular, under mild regularity assumptions on the convergence rate of Gradient Flow, we establish that mu_{beta} satisfies a Poincar\'e Inequality with constant O(C'+1/beta) for beta >= Omega(d), where C' is the Poincar\'e constant of mu_{beta} restricted to a neighborhood of the global minimizers of F. Under an additional mild condition on F, we show that mu_{beta} satisfies a Log-Sobolev Inequality with constant O(beta max(S, 1) max(C', 1)) where S denotes the second moment of mu_{beta}. Here asymptotic notation hides F-dependent parameters. At a high level, this establishes that optimizability via Gradient Flow from every initialization implies a Poincar\'e and Log-Sobolev Inequality for the low-temperature Gibbs measure, which in turn imply sampling from all initializations. Analogously, we establish that under the same assumptions, if F can be initialized from everywhere except some set S, then mu_{beta} satisfies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality with parameters (O(C'+1/beta), O(mu_{beta}(S))) for \beta = Omega(d). At a high level, this shows while optimizability from 'most' initializations implies a Weak Poincar\'e Inequality, which in turn implies sampling from suitable warm starts. Our regularity assumptions are mild and as a consequence, we show we can efficiently sample from several new natural and interesting classes of non-log-concave densities, an important setting with relatively few examples. As another corollary, we obtain efficient discrete-time sampling results for log-concave measures satisfying milder regularity conditions than smoothness, similar to Lehec (2023).</p></details> | COLT 2025 |
| **[What Makes Treatment Effects Identifiable? Characterizations and Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04194v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap. In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960).

| **[Beyond Distance: Mobility Neural Embeddings Reveal Visible and Invisible Barriers in Urban Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24061v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility in cities is shaped not only by visible structures such as highways, rivers, and parks but also by invisible barriers rooted in socioeconomic segregation, uneven access to amenities, and administrative divisions. Yet identifying and quantifying these barriers at scale and their relative importance on people's movements remains a major challenge. Neural embedding models, originally developed for language, offer a powerful way to capture the complexity of human mobility from large-scale data. Here, we apply this approach to 25.4 million observed trajectories across 11 major U.S. cities, learning mobility embeddings that reveal how people move through urban space. These mobility embeddings define a functional distance between places, one that reflects behavioral rather than physical proximity, and allow us to detect barriers between neighborhoods that are geographically close but behaviorally disconnected. We find that the strongest predictors of these barriers are differences in access to amenities, administrative borders, and residential segregation by income and race. These invisible borders are concentrated in urban cores and persist across cities, spatial scales, and time periods. Physical infrastructure, such as highways and parks, plays a secondary but still significant role, especially at short distances. We also find that individuals who cross barriers tend to do so outside of traditional commuting hours and are more likely to live in areas with greater racial diversity, and higher transit use or income. Together, these findings reveal how spatial, social, and behavioral forces structure urban accessibility and provide a scalable framework to detect and monitor barriers in cities, with applications in planning, policy evaluation, and equity analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 19 figures, and 12 tables</p></details> |

A central server housing a library of files populates both private and access caches using uncoded placement. In this work, we focus on a constrained indexing regime, referred to as the intersection class, in which the sets used to index the demands of each user must have a nonempty intersection. This regime models resource-limited IoT scenarios such as edge-assisted IoT systems, where devices with small private caches connect to a small number of shared caches. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the system parameters fall within this intersection class. Under this condition, we propose a centralized coded caching scheme and characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Next, we define a uniform-intersection subclass and establish a condition under which the system belongs to this subclass. Within this subclass, the proposed scheme has a regular structure, with each transmission benefiting the same number of users, and we characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Additionally, we derive an index coding-based lower bound on the minimum achievable worst-case rate under uncoded placement. Finally, we provide numerical comparisons between the rate of the proposed scheme, the new lower bound, and bounds from the original work.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages and 3 figures</p></details> |

In the context of Horn logic, these correspond to Horn expressions and characteristic models, respectively. To date, the complexity status of this problem is widely open, and it is further known to generalize the notorious hypergraph dualization problem, even in the context of acyclic convex geometries, i.e., closure systems admitting an acyclic implicational base. This paper studies this later class with a focus on the degree, which corresponds to the maximal number of implications in which an element occurs. We show that the problem is tractable for bounded values of this parameter, even when relaxed to the notions of premise- and conclusion-degree. Our algorithms rely on structural properties of acyclic convex geometries and involve various techniques from algorithmic enumeration such as solution graph traversal, saturation techniques, and a sequential approach leveraging from acyclicity. They are shown to perform in incremental-polynomial time for the computation of irreducible closed sets, and in polynomial time for the construction of an implicational base. Finally, we argue that our running times cannot be improved to polynomial delay using the standard framework of flashlight search.</p></details> | 36 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Region Based SLAM-Aware Exploration: Efficient and Robust Autonomous Mapping Strategy That Can Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10416v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous exploration for mapping unknown large scale environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, with efficiency in time, stability against map corruption and computational resources being crucial. This paper presents a novel approach to indoor exploration that addresses these key issues in existing methods. We introduce a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)-aware region-based exploration strategy that partitions the environment into discrete regions, allowing the robot to incrementally explore and stabilize each region before moving to the next one. This approach significantly reduces redundant exploration and improves overall efficiency. As the device finishes exploring a region and stabilizes it, we also perform SLAM keyframe marginalization, a technique which reduces problem complexity by eliminating variables, while preserving their essential information. To improves robustness and further enhance efficiency, we develop a checkpoint system that enables the robot to resume exploration from the last stable region in case of failures, eliminating the need for complete re-exploration. Our method, tested in real homes, office and simulations, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The improvements demonstrate substantial enhancements in various real world environments, with significant reductions in keyframe usage (85%), submap usage (50% office, 32% home), pose graph optimization time (78-80%), and exploration duration (10-15%). This region-based strategy with keyframe marginalization offers an efficient solution for autonomous robotic mapping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

Motivational Interviewing (MI) is gaining attention as a theoretical basis for boosting expertise in the development of these chatbots. However, existing datasets are showing limitations for training chatbots, leading to a substantial demand for publicly available resources in the field of MI and psychotherapy. These challenges are even more pronounced in non-English languages, where they receive less attention. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that simulates MI sessions enriched with the expertise of professional therapists. We train an MI forecaster model that mimics the behavioral choices of professional therapists and employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate utterances through prompt engineering. Then, we present KMI, the first synthetic dataset theoretically grounded in MI, containing 1,000 high-quality Korean Motivational Interviewing dialogues. Through an extensive expert evaluation of the generated dataset and the dialogue model trained on it, we demonstrate the quality, expertise, and practicality of KMI. We also introduce novel metrics derived from MI theory in order to evaluate dialogues from the perspective of MI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NAACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

A key challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths. Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans. With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10% improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main article : 16 pages, 7 figures and 4 tables.

We develop lightweight multi-modal adaptation techniques that enable zero-shot operation on raw scientific data, along with human-in-the-loop refinement and heuristic-based temporal enhancement options.

Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for future hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from 13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over HMA via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The MoE is trained and validated against gridded historical precipitation data, yielding 32% improvement over an equally-weighted average and 254% improvement over choosing any single ensemble member. This approach is then used to generate precipitation projections for the near future (2036-2065) and far future (2066-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared to previous estimates, the MoE projects wetter summers but drier winters over the western Himalayas and Karakoram and wetter winters over the Tibetan Plateau, Hengduan Shan, and South East Tibet.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages 8 figures (main text), 32 pages 14 figures (total)</p></details> |

While these approaches have potential generalization advantages due to their independence from the scanner geometry and the injected activity level, they forgo the opportunity to explicitly model the interaction between the DM prior and noisy measurement data, potentially limiting reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we propose a supervised DM-based algorithm for PET reconstruction. Our method enforces the non-negativity of PET's Poisson likelihood model and accommodates the wide intensity range of PET images. Through experiments on realistic brain PET phantoms, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms or matches state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods quantitatively across a range of dose levels. We further conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed components in our model, as well as its dependence on training data, parameter count, and number of diffusion steps. Additionally, we show that our approach enables more accurate posterior sampling than unsupervised DM-based methods, suggesting improved uncertainty estimation. Finally, we extend our methodology to a practical approach for fully 3D PET and present example results from real [$^{18}$F]FDG brain PET data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures.

Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the full version (27 pages) of the paper 'Riddle Me This!

Our approach is designed as general enough to be applicable to a wide range of data-parallel computations and for various kinds of target parallel architectures. To efficiently target the deep and complex memory and core hierarchies of contemporary architectures, we exploit our introduced (de/re)-composition approach for a correct-by-construction, parametrized cache blocking and parallelization strategy. We show that our approach is powerful enough to express, in the same formalism, the (de/re)-composition strategies of different classes of state-of-the-art approaches (scheduling-based, polyhedral, etc), and we demonstrate that the parameters of our strategies enable systematically generating code that can be fully automatically optimized (auto-tuned) for the particular target architecture and characteristics of the input and output data (e.g., their sizes and memory layouts). Particularly, our experiments confirm that via auto-tuning, we achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art approaches, including hand-optimized solutions provided by vendors (such as NVIDIA cuBLAS/cuDNN and Intel oneMKL/oneDNN), on real-world data sets and for a variety of data-parallel computations, including: linear algebra routines, stencil and quantum chemistry computations, data mining algorithms, and computations that recently gained high attention due to their relevance for deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper is published at ACM TOPLAS and presented at PLDI'24</p></details> |

However, due to the need for per-sample network training, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical adoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the components of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in terms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time. We uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a state-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When all methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7 different UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared to the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then tackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of hyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle training from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the weights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher quality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at 0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by 0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar speeds.

However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%.

While recent approaches have explored representing time series as text using large language models (LLMs), these methods remain limited by the discrete nature of token sequences and lack the perceptual intuition humans typically apply, such as interpreting visual patterns. In this paper, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning framework that transforms raw time series into structured visual and textual perspectives. Rather than using natural language or real-world images, we construct both modalities directly from numerical sequences. We then align these views in a shared semantic space via contrastive learning, enabling the model to capture richer and more complementary representations. Furthermore, we introduce a variate selection module that leverages the aligned representations to identify the most informative variables for multivariate forecasting. Extensive experiments on fifteen short-term and six long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong unimodal and cross-modal baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal alignment in enhancing time series forecasting.

This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising 8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc., providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of 90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain.

This study presents a diffusion model-based super-resolution virtual staining approach utilizing a Brownian bridge process to enhance both the spatial resolution and fidelity of label-free virtual tissue staining, addressing the limitations of traditional deep learning-based methods. Our approach integrates novel sampling techniques into a diffusion model-based image inference process to significantly reduce the variance in the generated virtually stained images, resulting in more stable and accurate outputs. Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | 39 Pages, 7 Figures |

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

Or, if available online, may only be available in formats (e.g., language and readability) that are inaccessible to local populations (e.g., English-language, high resource settings/cultural context). The approach is demonstrated using the widely spoken Pidgin dialect, but our open-source framework has been designed to enable rapid and easy extension to other languages/dialects. This work presents an AI-powered framework designed to process and translate complex medical documents, e.g., user manuals for prosthetic devices, into marginalised languages. The system enables users -- such as healthcare workers or patients -- to upload English-language medical equipment manuals, pose questions in their native language, and receive accurate, localised answers in real time. Technically, the system integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing and semantic understanding of the uploaded manuals. It then employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for generative question-answering and multilingual translation. Beyond simple translation, it ensures accessibility to device instructions, treatment protocols, and safety information, empowering patients and clinicians to make informed healthcare decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 0 figures, 0 tables</p></details> |
| **[Thinking with Images for Multimodal Reasoning: Foundations, Methods, and Future Frontiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23918v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions. (1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications. (4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions. By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ma...</summary><p>We maintain a real-time GitHub repository tracking progress at: https://github.com/zhaochen0110/Awesome_Think_With_Images</p></details> |

Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

However, for local tasks such as chord estimation, it is widely assumed that contrastively trained general-purpose self-supervised models are inadequate and that more sophisticated SSL is necessary; e.g., masked modeling. Our paper challenges this assumption by revealing the potential of contrastive SSL paired with a transformer in local MIR tasks. We consider a lightweight vision transformer with one-dimensional patches in the time--frequency domain (ViT-1D) and train it with simple contrastive SSL through normalized temperature-scaled cross-entropy loss (NT-Xent). Although NT-Xent operates only over the class token, we observe that, potentially thanks to weight sharing, informative musical properties emerge in ViT-1D's sequence tokens. On global tasks, the temporal average of class and sequence tokens offers a performance increase compared to the class token alone, showing useful properties in the sequence tokens. On local tasks, sequence tokens perform unexpectedly well, despite not being specifically trained for. Furthermore, high-level musical features such as onsets emerge from layer-wise attention maps and self-similarity matrices show different layers capture different musical dimensions. Our paper does not focus on improving performance but advances the musical interpretation of transformers and sheds light on some overlooked abilities of contrastive SSL paired with transformers for sequence modeling in MIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISMIR 2025</p></details> |

After first pretraining on approximately 60,000 hours of music, we use a comparatively smaller, high-quality subset, to finetune models to produce musical continuations, perform symbolic classification tasks, and produce general-purpose contrastive MIDI embeddings by adapting the SimCLR framework to symbolic music. When evaluating piano continuation coherence, our generative model outperforms leading symbolic generation techniques and remains competitive with proprietary audio generation models. On MIR classification benchmarks, frozen representations from our contrastive model achieve state-of-the-art results in linear probe experiments, while direct finetuning demonstrates the generalizability of pretrained representations, often requiring only a few hundred labeled examples to specialize to downstream tasks.</p></details> | ISMIR (2025) |

Recent methods, such as DUST3R and its successors, directly regress pointmaps from image pairs without relying on known scene geometry or camera parameters. However, the performance of these models is constrained by the diversity and scale of available training data. In this work, we introduce Puzzles, a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes an unbounded volume of high-quality posed video-depth data from a single image or video clip. By simulating diverse camera trajectories and realistic scene geometry through targeted image transformations, Puzzles significantly enhances data variety. Extensive experiments show that integrating Puzzles into existing video-based 3D reconstruction pipelines consistently boosts performance without modifying the underlying network architecture. Notably, models trained on only ten percent of the original data augmented with Puzzles still achieve accuracy comparable to those trained on the full dataset.

Recent advancements in efficient point cloud transformers have underscored the efficacy of integrating information in sparse formats. When it comes to fusion, since image patches are dense in pixel space with ambiguous depth, it necessitates additional design considerations for effective fusion. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of design choices for Transformer-based sparse cameraLiDAR fusion. This investigation encompasses strategies for image-to-3D and LiDAR-to-2D mapping, attention neighbor grouping, single modal tokenizer, and micro-structure of Transformer. By amalgamating the most effective principles uncovered through our investigation, we introduce FlatFusion, a carefully designed framework for sparse camera-LiDAR fusion. Notably, FlatFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse Transformer-based methods, including UniTR, CMT, and SparseFusion, achieving 73.7 NDS on the nuScenes validation set with 10.1 FPS with PyTorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Textual Prompt Learning with Anchored Attributes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09442v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Textual-based prompt learning methods primarily employ multiple learnable soft prompts and hard class tokens in a cascading manner as text inputs, aiming to align image and text (category) spaces for downstream tasks. However, current training is restricted to aligning images with predefined known categories and cannot be associated with unknown categories. In this work, we propose utilizing universal attributes as a bridge to enhance the alignment between images and unknown categories. Specifically, we introduce an Attribute-anchored Textual Prompt learning method for vision-language models, named ATPrompt. This approach expands the learning space of soft prompts from the original one-dimensional category level into the multi-dimensional attribute level by incorporating multiple attribute tokens into the learnable soft prompts. Through this modification, we transform the text prompt from a category-centric form to an attribute-category hybrid form. Additionally, we introduce a straightforward differentiable attribute search method to identify representative and suitable attributes for downstream tasks. As an easy-to-use plug-in technique, ATPrompt can seamlessly replace the existing basic prompt format in textual-based methods, providing general improvements at a negligible computational cost. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[VMoBA: Mixture-of-Block Attention for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23858v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration, high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |

Drawing inspiration from the structural similarity index measure and mathematical morphology, PointSSIM enables robust comparison across binary images of varying resolutions by transforming them into marked point pattern representations. The key features of the image, referred to as anchor points, are extracted from binary images by identifying locally adaptive maxima from the minimal distance transform. Image comparisons are then performed using a summary vector, capturing intensity, connectivity, complexity, and structural attributes. Results show that this approach provides an efficient and reliable method for image comparison, particularly suited to applications requiring structural analysis across different resolutions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Low-latency vision transformers via large-scale multi-head attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23832v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking among a few heads of multi-head attention (MHA) across transformer blocks in classification tasks was recently demonstrated through the quantification of single-nodal performance (SNP). This finding indicates that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. This underlying learning mechanism is generalized to large-scale MHA (LS-MHA) using a single matrix value representing single-head performance (SHP), analogous to single-filter performance in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results indicate that each SHP matrix comprises multiple unit clusters such that each label being explicitly recognized by a few heads with negligible noise. This leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) along the transformer blocks, thereby improving classification accuracy. These features give rise to several distinct vision transformer (ViT) architectures that achieve the same accuracy but differ in their LS-MHA structures. As a result, their soft committee yields superior accuracy, an outcome not typically observed in CNNs which rely on hundreds of filters. In addition, a significant reduction in latency is achieved without affecting the accuracy by replacing the initial transformer blocks with convolutional layers. This substitution accelerates early-stage learning, which is then improved by subsequent transformer layers. The extension of this learning mechanism to natural language processing tasks, based on quantitative differences between CNNs and ViT architectures, has the potential to yield new insights in deep learning. The findings are demonstrated using compact convolutional transformer architectures trained on the CIFAR-100 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning World Models With Hierarchical Temporal Abstractions: A Probabilistic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16078v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machines that can replicate human intelligence with type 2 reasoning capabilities should be able to reason at multiple levels of spatio-temporal abstractions and scales using internal world models. Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology, 2024</p></details> |

The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, via so-called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appears in iterative fashion and acts as a smart neural architecture search, The experiments demonstrated the utility of this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated the so-called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, the DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy- and resource-efficient deep learning training.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold reduction in visual tokens.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework.

However, this task is inherently complex, as it demands the seamless integration of perception, planning, and control which existing approaches often treat separately. Moreover, it requires accurate long-horizon planning to predict action sequences, in contrast to many current techniques, which tend to be myopic. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D inspection approach that unifies perception, planning, and control within a single data-driven predictive control framework. Unlike traditional methods that rely on known UAS dynamic models, our approach requires only input-output data, making it easily applicable to off-the-shelf black-box UASs. Our method incorporates back-face elimination, a visibility determination technique from 3D computer graphics, directly into the control loop, thereby enabling the online generation of accurate, long-horizon 3D inspection trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 European Control Conference (ECC), Thessaloniki, Greece, 24-27 June 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient and Accurate Image Provenance Analysis: A Scalable Pipeline for Large-scale Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23707v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of modified images on social networks that are driven by widely accessible editing tools demands robust forensic tools for digital governance. Image provenance analysis, which filters various query image variants and constructs a directed graph to trace their phylogeny history, has emerged as a critical solution. However, existing methods face two fundamental limitations: First, accuracy issues arise from overlooking heavily modified images due to low similarity while failing to exclude unrelated images and determine modification directions under diverse modification scenarios. Second, scalability bottlenecks stem from pairwise image analysis incurs quadratic complexity, hindering application in large-scale scenarios. This paper presents a scalable end-to-end pipeline for image provenance analysis that achieves high precision with linear complexity. This improves filtering effectiveness through modification relationship tracing, which enables the comprehensive discovery of image variants regardless of their visual similarity to the query. In addition, the proposed pipeline integrates local features matching and compression artifact capturing, enhancing robustness against diverse modifications and enabling accurate analysis of images' relationships. This allows the generation of a directed provenance graph that accurately characterizes the image's phylogeny history. Furthermore, by optimizing similarity calculations and eliminating redundant pairwise analysis during graph construction, the pipeline achieves a linear time complexity, ensuring its scalability for large-scale scenarios. Experiments demonstrate pipeline's superior performance, achieving a 16.7-56.1% accuracy improvement. Notably, it exhibits significant scalability with an average 3.0-second response time on 10 million scale images, which is far shorter than the SOTA approach's 12-minute duration.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

All quadratic functions, bent functions and most known APN functions are plateaued, so many cryptographic primitives rely on plateaued functions as building blocks. The main focus of our study is the interplay of the Walsh transform and linearity of a plateaued function, its differential properties, and their value distributions, i.e., the sizes of image and preimage sets. In particular, we study the special case of ''almost balanced'' plateaued functions, which only have two nonzero preimage set sizes, generalizing for instance all monomial functions. We achieve several direct connections and (non)existence conditions for these functions, showing for instance that plateaued $d$-to-$1$ functions (and thus plateaued monomials) only exist for a very select choice of $d$, and we derive for all these functions their linearity as well as bounds on their differential uniformity. We also specifically study the Walsh transform of plateaued APN functions and their relation to their value distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages.

Network pruning reduces the computational complexity by removing less important operations while maintaining performance. However, pruning a model on an unseen data domain, leads to a misevaluation of weight significance, resulting in suboptimal resource assignment. In this work, we find that task-sensitive layers initially fail to improve the feature representation on downstream tasks, leading to performance loss for early pruning decisions. To address this problem, we introduce Pruning by Block Benefit (P3B), a pruning method that utilizes the relative contribution on block level to globally assign parameter resources. P3B identifies low-impact components to reduce parameter allocation while preserving critical ones. Classical pruning mask optimization struggles to reactivate zero-mask-elements. In contrast, P3B sets a layerwise keep ratio based on global performance metrics, ensuring the reactivation of late-converging blocks. We show in extensive experiments that P3B is a state of the art pruning method with most noticeable gains in transfer learning tasks. Notably, P3B is able to conserve high performance, even in high sparsity regimes of 70% parameter reduction while only losing 0.64% in accuracy.</p></details> | ICCV'25 Workshops |
| **[Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335v4)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we study this question by exploring its relation to lossy reductions, i.e., reductions $R$ for which it holds that $I(X;R(X)) \ll n$ for all distributions $X$ over inputs of size $n$. Our main result is that either OWFs exist or any lossy reduction for any promise problem $\Pi$ runs in time $2^{\Omega(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$, where $\tau_\Pi(n)$ is the infimum of the runtime of all (worst-case) solvers of $\Pi$ on instances of size $n$. In fact, our result requires a milder condition, that $R$ is lossy for sparse uniform distributions (which we call mild-lossiness). It also extends to $f$-reductions as long as $f$ is a non-constant permutation-invariant Boolean function, which includes And-, Or-, Maj-, Parity-, Modulo$_k$, and Threshold$_k$-reductions. Additionally, we show that worst-case to average-case Karp reductions and randomized encodings are special cases of mildly-lossy reductions and improve the runtime above as $2^{\Omega(\log \tau_\Pi)}$ when these mappings are considered. Restricting to weak fine-grained OWFs, this runtime can be further improved as $\Omega(\tau_\Pi)$. Taking $\Pi$ as $kSAT$, our results provide sufficient conditions under which (fine-grained) OWFs exist assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Conversely, if (fine-grained) OWFs do not exist, we obtain impossibilities on instance compressions (Harnik and Naor, FOCS 2006) and instance randomizations of $kSAT$ under the ETH. Finally, we partially extend these findings to the quantum setting; the existence of a pure quantum mildly-lossy reduction for $\Pi$ within the runtime $2^{o(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$ implies the existence of one-way state generators.</p></details> | 56 pages |

We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.48 years on an established dataset, and further improves to 4.79 and 5.07 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.62 years. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ISVC 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods tend to overlook their intrinsic relationship, that is, the semantic usually provides some reasonable explainability "$\textbf{why}$" for the behavior "$\textbf{what}$", which may constrain the full potential of GR. To this end, we present Chunk AutoRegressive Modeling (CAR), a new generation paradigm following the decision pattern that users usually think semantic aspects of items (e.g. brand) and then take actions on target items (e.g. purchase). Our CAR, for the $\textit{first time}$, incorporates semantics (SIDs) and behavior (UID) into a single autoregressive transformer from an ``act-with-think'' dual perspective via chunk-level autoregression. Specifically, CAR packs SIDs and UID into a conceptual chunk for item unified representation, allowing each decoding step to make a holistic prediction. Experiments show that our CAR significantly outperforms existing methods based on traditional AR, improving Recall@5 by 7.93% to 22.30%. Furthermore, we verify the scaling effect between model performance and SIDs bit number, demonstrating that CAR preliminary emulates a kind of slow-thinking style mechanism akin to the reasoning processes observed in large language models (LLMs).</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

However, deploying RL agents in production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering. We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$ success, and $850$ time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages in total, 10 pages of main paper, 5 figures</p></details> |

Prevailing AVS methods typically adopt an audio-centric Transformer architecture, where object queries are derived from audio features. However, audio-centric Transformers suffer from two limitations: perception ambiguity caused by the mixed nature of audio, and weakened dense prediction ability due to visual detail loss. To address these limitations, we propose a new Vision-Centric Transformer (VCT) framework that leverages vision-derived queries to iteratively fetch corresponding audio and visual information, enabling queries to better distinguish between different sounding objects from mixed audio and accurately delineate their contours. Additionally, we also introduce a Prototype Prompted Query Generation (PPQG) module within our VCT framework to generate vision-derived queries that are both semantically aware and visually rich through audio prototype prompting and pixel context grouping, facilitating audio-visual information aggregation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VCT framework achieves new state-of-the-art performances on three subsets of the AVSBench dataset.

However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals).

However, these approaches face significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1) We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8 to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame; subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image SR show surprising fine details.</p></details> | ICCV, 2025 |

However, related literature suggests that tabular Transformers may struggle to outperform classical Machine Learning algorithms, such as Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT). In this paper, we aim to challenge GBDTs with tabular Transformers on a typical task faced in e-commerce, namely fraud detection. Our study is additionally motivated by the problem of selection bias, often occurring in real-life fraud detection systems. It is caused by the production system affecting which subset of traffic becomes labeled. This issue is typically addressed by sampling randomly a small part of the whole production data, referred to as a Control Group. This subset follows a target distribution of production data and therefore is usually preferred for training classification models with standard ML algorithms. Our methodology leverages the capabilities of Transformers to learn transferable representations using all available data by means of SSL, giving it an advantage over classical methods. Furthermore, we conduct large-scale experiments, pre-training tabular Transformers on vast amounts of data instances and fine-tuning them on smaller target datasets. The proposed approach outperforms heavily tuned GBDTs by a considerable margin of the Average Precision (AP) score in offline evaluations. Finally, we report the results of an online A/B experiment. Experimental results confirm the superiority of tabular Transformers compared to GBDTs in production, demonstrated by a statistically significant improvement in our business metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CIKM'25, Applied Research track</p></details> |

Motivated by the observations of self-attention's inter-layer repetition, we introduce a convolutionized self-attention module named Convolutional Attention~(ConvAttn) that emulates self-attention's long-range modeling capability and instance-dependent weighting with a single shared large kernel and dynamic kernels. By utilizing the ConvAttn module, we significantly reduce the reliance on self-attention and its involved memory-bound operations while maintaining the representational capability of Transformers. Furthermore, we overcome the challenge of integrating flash attention into the lightweight SR regime, effectively mitigating self-attention's inherent memory bottleneck. We scale up the window size to 32$\times$32 with flash attention rather than proposing an intricate self-attention module, significantly improving PSNR by 0.31dB on Urban100$\times$2 while reducing latency and memory usage by 16$\times$ and 12.2$\times$. Building on these approaches, our proposed network, termed Emulating Self-attention with Convolution~(ESC), notably improves PSNR by 0.27 dB on Urban100$\times$4 compared to HiT-SRF, reducing the latency and memory usage by 3.7$\times$ and 6.2$\times$, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ESC maintains the ability for long-range modeling, data scalability, and the representational power of Transformers despite most self-attention being replaced by the ConvAttn module.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Mono-Modalizing Extremely Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15596v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

However, its potential in the more challenging data-centric approaches remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce the concept of Data Residual Matching for the first time, leveraging data-level skip connections to facilitate data generation and mitigate data information vanishing. This approach maintains a balance between newly acquired knowledge through pixel space optimization and existing core local information identification within raw data modalities, specifically for the dataset distillation task. Furthermore, by incorporating optimization-level refinements, our method significantly improves computational efficiency, achieving superior performance while reducing training time and peak GPU memory usage by 50%. Consequently, the proposed method Fast and Accurate Data Residual Matching for Dataset Distillation (FADRM) establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing methods across multiple dataset benchmarks in both efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, with ResNet-18 as the student model and a 0.8% compression ratio on ImageNet-1K, the method achieves 47.7% test accuracy in single-model dataset distillation and 50.0% in multi-model dataset distillation, surpassing RDED by +5.7% and outperforming state-of-the-art multi-model approaches, EDC and CV-DD, by +1.4% and +4.0%.

Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces C3VDv2, the second version (v2) of the high-definition Colonoscopy 3D Video Dataset, featuring enhanced realism designed to facilitate the quantitative evaluation of 3D colon reconstruction algorithms. 192 video sequences were captured by imaging 60 unique, high-fidelity silicone colon phantom segments. Ground truth depth, surface normals, optical flow, occlusion, six-degree-of-freedom pose, coverage maps, and 3D models are provided for 169 colonoscopy videos. Eight simulated screening colonoscopy videos acquired by a gastroenterologist are provided with ground truth poses. The dataset includes 15 videos featuring colon deformations for qualitative assessment. C3VDv2 emulates diverse and challenging scenarios for 3D reconstruction algorithms, including fecal debris, mucous pools, blood, debris obscuring the colonoscope lens, en-face views, and fast camera motion. The enhanced realism of C3VDv2 will allow for more robust and representative development and evaluation of 3D reconstruction algorithms.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Characterizations and Estimators Beyond Unconfoundedness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04194v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the widely used estimators of the average treatment effect (ATE) in causal inference rely on the assumptions of unconfoundedness and overlap. Unconfoundedness requires that the observed covariates account for all correlations between the outcome and treatment. Overlap requires the existence of randomness in treatment decisions for all individuals. Nevertheless, many types of studies frequently violate unconfoundedness or overlap, for instance, observational studies with deterministic treatment decisions - popularly known as Regression Discontinuity designs - violate overlap. In this paper, we initiate the study of general conditions that enable the identification of the average treatment effect, extending beyond unconfoundedness and overlap. In particular, following the paradigm of statistical learning theory, we provide an interpretable condition that is sufficient and necessary for the identification of ATE. Moreover, this condition also characterizes the identification of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) and can be used to characterize other treatment effects as well. To illustrate the utility of our condition, we present several well-studied scenarios where our condition is satisfied and, hence, we prove that ATE can be identified in regimes that prior works could not capture. For example, under mild assumptions on the data distributions, this holds for the models proposed by Tan (2006) and Rosenbaum (2002), and the Regression Discontinuity design model introduced by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960). For each of these scenarios, we also show that, under natural additional assumptions, ATE can be estimated from finite samples. We believe these findings open new avenues for bridging learning-theoretic insights and causal inference methodologies, particularly in observational studies with complex treatment mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 38th Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) 2025. v2 strengthens results to give a tight characterization for ATE identification</p></details> |

A key challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths. Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans. With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10% improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main article : 16 pages, 7 figures and 4 tables.

Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack.

Such analyses require multivariate models capable of accounting for the complex correlation structures between microbes and metabolites. However, existing multivariate models often suffer from low statistical power for detecting microbiome-metabolome interactions due to small sample sizes and weak biological signals. To address these challenges, we introduce CoMMiT, Co-informed inference of Microbiome-Metabolome Interactions via novel Transfer learning models. Unlike conventional transfer-learning methods that borrow information from external datasets, CoMMiT leverages similarities across metabolites within a single cohort, reducing the risk of negative transfer often caused by differences in sequencing platforms and bioinformatic pipelines across studies. CoMMiT operates under the flexible assumption that auxiliary metabolites are collectively informative for the target metabolite, without requiring individual auxiliary metabolites to be informative. CoMMiT uses a novel data-driven approach to selecting the optimal set of auxiliary metabolites. Using this optimal set, CoMMiT employs a de-biasing framework to enable efficient calculation of p-values, facilitating the identification of statistically significant microbiome-metabolome interactions. Applying CoMMiT to a feeding study reveals biologically meaningful microbiome-metabolome interactions under a low glycemic load diet, demonstrating the diet-host link through gut metabolism.</p></details> | 38 pages, 5 figures |

Blindly applied to lower-resolution auto-fluorescence images of label-free human lung tissue samples, the diffusion-based super-resolution virtual staining model consistently outperformed conventional approaches in resolution, structural similarity and perceptual accuracy, successfully achieving a super-resolution factor of 4-5x, increasing the output space-bandwidth product by 16-25-fold compared to the input label-free microscopy images. Diffusion-based super-resolved virtual tissue staining not only improves resolution and image quality but also enhances the reliability of virtual staining without traditional chemical staining, offering significant potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | 39 Pages, 7 Figures |

As the SPIM can represent Ising problems with rank-one coupling matrices, multiplexed versions have been proposed to enhance the applicability to higher-rank interactions. However, the multiplexing cost reduces the implementation efficiency, and even without multiplexing, the SPIM is known to represent coupling matrices beyond rank-one. In this paper, to clarify the intrinsic representation power of the original SPIM, we propose spatial QUBO (spQUBO), a formulation of Ising problems with spatially convolutional structures. We prove that any spQUBO reduces to a two-dimensional spQUBO, with the convolutional structure preserved, and that any two-dimensional spQUBO can be efficiently implemented on the SPIM without multiplexing. We further demonstrate its practical applicability to distance-based combinatorial optimization, such as placement problems and clustering problems. These results advance our understanding of the class of optimization problems where SPIMs exhibit superior efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, spQUBO's efficiency is not limited to the SPIM architecture; we show that its convolutional structure allows efficient computation using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures (including supplementary information, 7 pages, 1 figure)</p></details> |

This is challenging as it involves deep vision-language understanding, pixel-level dense prediction and spatiotemporal reasoning. Despite notable progress in recent years, existing methods still exhibit a noticeable gap when considering all these aspects. In this work, we propose \textbf{ReferDINO}, a strong RVOS model that inherits region-level vision-language alignment from foundational visual grounding models, and is further endowed with pixel-level dense perception and cross-modal spatiotemporal reasoning. In detail, ReferDINO integrates two key components: 1) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that utilizes location prediction to progressively guide mask prediction through differentiable deformation mechanisms; 2) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that injects pretrained time-varying text features into inter-frame interaction to capture object-aware dynamic changes. Moreover, a confidence-aware query pruning strategy is designed to accelerate object decoding without compromising model performance. Extensive experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our ReferDINO significantly outperforms previous methods (e.g., +3.9% (\mathcal{J}&\mathcal{F}) on Ref-YouTube-VOS) with real-time inference speed (51 FPS).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

A Critical Look at Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24000v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and obscure their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github link: https://github.com/TomSheng21/tta-vlm</p></details> |

This gap is critical, as user-aligned behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics. To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems, catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Despite significant progress in recent years, most existing methods focus on uniformly distributed datasets, significantly limiting the practical applicability of their methods. In this paper, we propose a more practical problem setting named deep imbalanced clustering, where the underlying classes exhibit an imbalance distribution. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel optimal transport-based pseudo-label learning framework. Our framework formulates pseudo-label generation as a Semantic-regularized Progressive Partial Optimal Transport (SP$^2$OT) problem, which progressively transports each sample to imbalanced clusters under prior and semantic relation constraints, thus generating high-quality and imbalance-aware pseudo-labels. To solve the SP$^2$OT problem, we propose a projected mirror descent algorithm, which alternates between: (1) computing the gradient of the SP$^2$OT objective, and (2) performing gradient descent with projection via an entropy-regularized progressive partial optimal transport formulation. Furthermore, we formulate the second step as an unbalanced optimal transport problem with augmented constraints and develop an efficient solution based on fast matrix scaling algorithms. Experiments on various datasets, including a human-curated long-tailed CIFAR100, challenging ImageNet-R, and large-scale subsets of fine-grained iNaturalist2018 datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

| **[Learning Constraints Directly from Network Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23964v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network data conforms to a wide range of rules that arise from protocols, design principles, and deployment decisions (e.g., a packet's queuing delay must be less than its end-to-end delay). Formalizing such rules as logic constraints can (i) improve the quality of synthetic data, (ii) reduce the brittleness of machine learning (ML) models, and (iii) improve semantic understanding of network measurements. However, these benefits remain out of reach if rule extraction is manual or solely reliant on ML, as both approaches yield incomplete, unreliable, and/or inaccurate rules. This paper formulates rule extraction as a constraint modeling problem and introduces NetNomos that learns propositional logic constraints directly from raw network measurements. Constraint modeling in this domain is uniquely challenging due to the scale of the data, the inherent learning complexity and passive environment, and the lack of ground truth supervision. NetNomos addresses these challenges via a lattice-based search structured by constraint specificity and succinctness. Our approach reduces learning complexity from superquadratic to logarithmic and enables efficient traversal in combinatorial search space. Our evaluations on diverse network datasets show that NetNomos learns all benchmark rules, including those associated with as little as 0.01% of data points, in under three hours. In contrast, baseline methods discover less than 25% of the rules and require several days to run. Through three case studies, we show that: NetNomos (i) finds rule violations in the outputs of all seven synthetic traffic generators, hence can be used to assess and guide their generation process; (ii) detects semantic differences in traffic, hence can be used for anomaly detection; and (iii) automatically finds rules used for telemetry imputation, hence can support monitoring through inference.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Learning Li-ion battery health and degradation modes from data with aging-aware circuit models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06639v5)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-invasive estimation of Li-ion battery state-of-health from operational data is valuable for battery applications, but remains challenging. Pure model-based methods may suffer from inaccuracy and long-term instability of parameter estimates, whereas pure data-driven methods rely heavily on training data quality and quantity, causing lack of generality when extrapolating to unseen cases. We apply an aging-aware equivalent circuit model for health estimation, combining the flexibility of data-driven techniques within a model-based approach. A simplified electrical model with voltage source and resistor incorporates Gaussian process regression to learn capacity fade over time and also the dependence of resistance on operating conditions and time. The approach was validated against two datasets and shown to give accurate performance with less than 1% relative root mean square error (RMSE) in capacity and less than 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Critically, we show that the open circuit voltage versus state-of-charge function must be accurately known, and any inaccuracies or changes in this over time strongly influence the inferred resistance. However, this feature (or bug) may also be used to estimate in operando differential voltage curves from operational data.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Intelligent Orchestration of Distributed Large Foundation Model Inference at the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03668v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Foundation Models (LFMs), including multi-modal and generative models, promise to unlock new capabilities for next-generation Edge AI applications. However, performing inference with LFMs in resource-constrained and heterogeneous edge environments, such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), presents significant challenges for workload orchestration due to time-varying network, compute, and storage conditions. In particular, current split inference strategies, which partition LFM layers across nodes, are not designed to adapt to fluctuating workloads, dynamic bandwidth conditions, or evolving privacy constraints in high-utilization MEC environments. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive split inference orchestration framework that elevates both the placement and partitioning of LFM layers to runtime-tunable variables. Specifically, our framework enables real-time, quality-of-service (QoS)-aware management of inference workloads by extending conventional orchestrators with three key services: (1) Capacity-aware workload distribution, which continuously profiles node resources and selects an optimal subset of MEC nodes; (2) Dynamic partition migration, which transparently relocates pre-cut LFM segments in response to changes in utilization or network conditions; (3) Real-time reconfiguration, which dynamically re-splits LFM layers to balance latency, throughput, and privacy. We formalize the joint placement-partitioning problem, outline a reference architecture and algorithmic workflow, and discuss applicability in representative smart city, V2X, and industrial edge scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 50 references</p></details> |

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. By estimating the intrinsic dimension $m^{\ast}$ using multiple methods (participation ratio, Kaiser rule, and the Kneedle algorithm), it is found that $m^{\ast}$ increases with the model nonlinearity. Interestingly, in the weakly nonlinear regime, for trajectories initialized by exciting the first mode, the participation ratio estimates $m^{\ast} = 2, 3$, strongly suggesting that quasi-periodic motion on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold underlies the characteristic energy recurrences observed in the FPUT model.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Learning robust parameter inference and density reconstruction in flyer plate impact experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23914v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating physical parameters or material properties from experimental observations is a common objective in many areas of physics and material science. In many experiments, especially in shock physics, radiography is the primary means of observing the system of interest. However, radiography does not provide direct access to key state variables, such as density, which prevents the application of traditional parameter estimation approaches. Here we focus on flyer plate impact experiments on porous materials, and resolving the underlying parameterized equation of state (EoS) and crush porosity model parameters given radiographic observation(s). We use machine learning as a tool to demonstrate with high confidence that using only high impact velocity data does not provide sufficient information to accurately infer both EoS and crush model parameters, even with fully resolved density fields or a dynamic sequence of images. We thus propose an observable data set consisting of low and high impact velocity experiments/simulations that capture different regimes of compaction and shock propagation, and proceed to introduce a generative machine learning approach which produces a posterior distribution of physical parameters directly from radiographs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in estimating parameters from simulated flyer plate impact experiments, and show that the obtained estimates of EoS and crush model parameters can then be used in hydrodynamic simulations to obtain accurate and physically admissible density reconstructions. Finally, we examine the robustness of the approach to model mismatches, and find that the learned approach can provide useful parameter estimates in the presence of out-of-distribution radiographic noise and previously unseen physics, thereby promoting a potential breakthrough in estimating material properties from experimental radiographic images.</p></details> | 24 pages, 21 figures |

Ensemble learning, combining predictions from multiple models to form a single prediction, intensifies this problem due to cumulative energy consumption. This paper presents a novel approach to model selection that addresses the challenge of balancing the accuracy of AI models with their energy consumption in a live AI ensemble system. We explore how reducing the number of models or improving the efficiency of model usage within an ensemble during inference can reduce energy demands without substantially sacrificing accuracy. This study introduces and evaluates two model selection strategies, Static and Dynamic, for optimizing ensemble learning systems performance while minimizing energy usage. Our results demonstrate that the Static strategy improves the F1 score beyond the baseline, reducing average energy usage from 100% from the full ensemble to 62%. The Dynamic strategy further enhances F1 scores, using on average 76% compared to 100% of the full ensemble. Moreover, we propose an approach that balances accuracy with resource consumption, significantly reducing energy usage without substantially impacting accuracy. This method decreased the average energy usage of the Static strategy from approximately 62% to 14%, and for the Dynamic strategy, from around 76% to 57%. Our field study of Green AI using an operational AI system developed by a large professional services provider shows the practical applicability of adopting energy-conscious model selection strategies in live production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

Besides what intermediate steps work, the order of these steps critically affects the difficulty of the reasoning. This study addresses a novel task of unraveling chain of thought - reordering decoder input tokens to a learning-friendly sequence for Transformers to learn arithmetic tasks. The proposed pipeline first trains a Transformer on a mixture of target sequences arranged in different orders and then identifies benign orders as those with fast loss drops in the early stage. As the search space grows factorially with sequence length, we propose a two-stage hierarchical approach for inter- and intra-block reordering. Experiments on four order-sensitive arithmetic tasks show that our method identifies a learning-friendly order out of a few billion candidates. Notably, on the multiplication task, it recovered the reverse-digit order reported in prior studies.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

We show that the distance between the sampling distributions under unbounded DP and bounded DP goes to zero as the sample size $n$ goes to infinity, provided that the noise used to privatize $n$ is at an appropriate rate; we also establish that Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)-type posterior distributions converge under similar assumptions. We further give asymptotic results in the regime where the privacy budget for $n$ goes to zero, establishing similarity of sampling distributions as well as showing that the MLE in the unbounded setting converges to the bounded-DP MLE. In order to facilitate valid, finite-sample Bayesian inference on privatized data in the unbounded DP setting, we propose a reversible jump MCMC algorithm which extends the data augmentation MCMC of Ju et al. (2022). We also propose a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to compute the MLE from privatized data in both bounded and unbounded DP. We apply our methodology to analyze a linear regression model as well as a 2019 American Time Use Survey Microdata File which we model using a Dirichlet distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages before references, 42 pages in total, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is at https://github.com/KwaiVGI/VMoBA</p></details> |
| **[A Closer Look at Conditional Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23856v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great promise of Prompt Tuning (PT) in adapting large Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) to downstream tasks, they often struggle to overcome the Base-New Tradeoff (BNT) dilemma: as VLPMs are better tuned to a base task, their ability to generalize to new tasks diminishes. Recent work on conditional PT addresses this problem by replacing static prompts with dynamic Visual Image Information (VII)-conditioned prompts, improving the model's generalization to new tasks to some extent. In this work, we first identify a critical issue with existing conditional PT methods: using VII as the "condition" of prompts yields suboptimal performance, and even random noise-conditioned prompts can outperform the VII-conditioned counterparts. On further analysis, we find that learning dynamic prompts conditioned on Textual Class Information (TCI) is the key to solving the BNT problem. Motivated by this, we then propose Class-adaptive Prompt Tuning (CaPT), which enables fast adaptation of tuned models to new classes by learning TCI-conditioned prompts from base classes. Remarkably, CaPT can be used as a plugin to mitigate the BNT problem for existing unconditional PT schemes. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets show that CaPT consistently improves the performance of five strong unconditional PT baselines with negligible additional computational cost. Additionally, by integrating CaPT with our recently proposed DePT framework, we devise a new conditional PT approach, termed DeCaPT, which outperforms the H ACC of the state-of-the-art conditional PT scheme by 3.49%, averaged over the 11 datasets.

These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from static inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these capabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also introduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool misuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the threat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we first examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin increasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention, modular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze the corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying failure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and deceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment. These risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across perception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges, we systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different autonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control, constrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective reflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a unified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation, and joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety across the agent's decision-making loop.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Robustness of Decentralised Learning to Nodes and Data Disruption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02377v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the vibrant landscape of AI research, decentralised learning is gaining momentum. Decentralised learning allows individual nodes to keep data locally where they are generated and to share knowledge extracted from local data among themselves through an interactive process of collaborative refinement. This paradigm supports scenarios where data cannot leave local nodes due to privacy or sovereignty reasons or real-time constraints imposing proximity of models to locations where inference has to be carried out. The distributed nature of decentralised learning implies significant new research challenges with respect to centralised learning. Among them, in this paper, we focus on robustness issues. Specifically, we study the effect of nodes' disruption on the collective learning process. Assuming a given percentage of "central" nodes disappear from the network, we focus on different cases, characterised by (i) different distributions of data across nodes and (ii) different times when disruption occurs with respect to the start of the collaborative learning task. Through these configurations, we are able to show the non-trivial interplay between the properties of the network connecting nodes, the persistence of knowledge acquired collectively before disruption or lack thereof, and the effect of data availability pre- and post-disruption. Our results show that decentralised learning processes are remarkably robust to network disruption. As long as even minimum amounts of data remain available somewhere in the network, the learning process is able to recover from disruptions and achieve significant classification accuracy. This clearly varies depending on the remaining connectivity after disruption, but we show that even nodes that remain completely isolated can retain significant knowledge acquired before the disruption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppo...</summary><p>Supported by the H2020 HumaneAI Net (952026), CHIST-ERA-19-XAI010 SAI, PNRR - M4C2 - Investimento 1.3, Partenariato Esteso PE00000013 FAIR, PNRR - M4C2 - Investimento 1.3, Partenariato Esteso PE00000001 RESTART</p></details> |

However, the understanding of long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in significant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long videos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world applications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these issues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of processing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time. Particularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity context memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the distribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to retrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to existing models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference latency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video benchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method.

Devising formalisms to develop such internal world models, which accurately reflect the causal hierarchies inherent in the dynamics of the real world, is a critical research challenge in the domains of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This thesis identifies several limitations with the prevalent use of state space models (SSMs) as internal world models and propose two new probabilistic formalisms namely Hidden-Parameter SSMs and Multi-Time Scale SSMs to address these drawbacks. The structure of graphical models in both formalisms facilitates scalable exact probabilistic inference using belief propagation, as well as end-to-end learning via backpropagation through time. This approach permits the development of scalable, adaptive hierarchical world models capable of representing nonstationary dynamics across multiple temporal abstractions and scales. Moreover, these probabilistic formalisms integrate the concept of uncertainty in world states, thus improving the system's capacity to emulate the stochastic nature of the real world and quantify the confidence in its predictions. The thesis also discuss how these formalisms are in line with related neuroscience literature on Bayesian brain hypothesis and predicitive processing. Our experiments on various real and simulated robots demonstrate that our formalisms can match and in many cases exceed the performance of contemporary transformer variants in making long-range future predictions. We conclude the thesis by reflecting on the limitations of our current models and suggesting directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral Dissertation, Department of Computer Science, Karlsruhe Institute Of Technology, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards the Training of Deeper Predictive Coding Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23800v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding networks trained with equilibrium propagation are neural models that perform inference through an iterative energy minimization process. Previous studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in shallow architectures, but show significant performance degradation when depth exceeds five to seven layers. In this work, we show that the reason behind this degradation is due to exponentially imbalanced errors between layers during weight updates, and predictions from the previous layer not being effective in guiding updates in deeper layers. We address the first issue by introducing two novel methods to optimize the latent variables that use precision-weighting to re-balance the distribution of energy among layers during the `relaxation phase', and the second issue by proposing a novel weight update mechanism that reduces error accumulation in deeper layers. Empirically, we test our methods on a large number of image classification tasks, resulting in large improvements in test accuracy across networks with more than seven layers, with performances comparable to those of backprop on similar models. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the relaxation phase is important to train models using equilibrium propagation at scale, and open new possibilities for their application in complex tasks.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 7 figures |

In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CSC-SQL. On the BIRD private test set, our 7B model achieves 71.72\% execution accuracy, while the 32B model achieves 73.67\%.

| **[Single Image Test-Time Adaptation via Multi-View Co-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23705v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation enables a trained model to adjust to a new domain during inference, making it particularly valuable in clinical settings where such on-the-fly adaptation is required. However, existing techniques depend on large target domain datasets, which are often impractical and unavailable in medical scenarios that demand per-patient, real-time inference. Moreover, current methods commonly focus on two-dimensional images, failing to leverage the volumetric richness of medical imaging data. Bridging this gap, we propose a Patch-Based Multi-View Co-Training method for Single Image Test-Time adaptation. Our method enforces feature and prediction consistency through uncertainty-guided self-training, enabling effective volumetric segmentation in the target domain with only a single test-time image. Validated on three publicly available breast magnetic resonance imaging datasets for tumor segmentation, our method achieves performance close to the upper bound supervised benchmark while also outperforming all existing state-of-the-art methods, on average by a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 3.75%. We publicly share our accessible codebase, readily integrable with the popular nnUNet framework, at https://github.com/smriti-joshi/muvi.git.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

Current approaches either build specialized video models from scratch with enormous computational costs or add separate motion modules to image generators, both requiring learning temporal dynamics anew. We observe that modern image generation models possess underutilized potential in handling structured layouts with implicit temporal understanding. Building on this insight, we introduce GRID, which reformulates temporal sequences as grid layouts, enabling holistic processing of visual sequences while leveraging existing model capabilities. Through a parallel flow-matching training strategy with coarse-to-fine scheduling, our approach achieves up to 67 faster inference speeds while using <1/1000 of the computational resources compared to specialized models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRID not only excels in temporal tasks from Text-to-Video to 3D Editing but also preserves strong performance in image generation, establishing itself as an efficient and versatile omni-solution for visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/Should-AI-Lab/GRID</p></details> |

We propose a privacy-preserving coded aggregation scheme where the servers can not infer any information about the distributed users' local gradients, nor the aggregation value. In our scheme, each user encodes its local gradient into $\sK$ confidential messages intended exclusively for different servers using a multi-secret sharing method, and each server forwards the summation of the received confidential messages, while the users sequentially employ artificial noise alignment techniques to facilitate secure transmission. Through these summations, the user can recover the aggregation of all local gradients. We prove the privacy guarantee in the information-theoretic sense and characterize the uplink and downlink communication latency measured by \emph{normalized delivery time} (NDT), both of which decrease monotonically with the number of servers $\sK$ while increasing over most of the range of the number of users $\sM$. Finally, we establish a lower bound on the NDT of the considered system and theoretically prove that the scheme achieves the optimal uplink and downlink NDT under the conditions $\sK \gg \sM \gg 0$ and $\sK \gg \sM$, respectively. For arbitrary $\sK$ and $\sM$, the proposed scheme achieves the optimal uplink NDT within a multiplicative gap of $4$.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was in part presented at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT), 2023</p></details> |

This paper addresses the cost and scalability challenges encountered when constructing private LLM systems for personal or small group services, as aimed by Apple Intelligence. A Mac Studio cluster with Apple's M2 Ultra chips is established as a cost-efficient solution to host and accelerate the pretrained DBRX model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our performance analysis reveal that parallel execution of the model's experts across two to four machine nodes significantly reduces inference time. We find that computation time for the experts is comparable to the communication time for exchanging their outputs, emphasizing the importance of network latency over bandwidth. We also observe significant management overhead due to Apple software stack's memory management logic. Based on these findings, we develop optimization schemes to eliminate the memory management overhead. As a result, the Mac Studio cluster is 1.15 times more cost-efficient than the state-of-the-art AI supercomputer with NVIDIA H100 GPUs. In addition, we construct a performance model to estimate system performance under varying configurations, and the model provides valuable insights for designing private LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Research in Adaptive and Convergent Systems (RACS '24), November 5--8, 2024, Pompei, Italy</p></details> |

However, existing methods still struggle to scale up as large general video generation models, limiting their potential in real applications. In this paper, we propose OmniHuman, a Diffusion Transformer-based framework that scales up data by mixing motion-related conditions into the training phase. To this end, we introduce two training principles for these mixed conditions, along with the corresponding model architecture and inference strategy. These designs enable OmniHuman to fully leverage data-driven motion generation, ultimately achieving highly realistic human video generation. More importantly, OmniHuman supports various portrait contents (face close-up, portrait, half-body, full-body), supports both talking and singing, handles human-object interactions and challenging body poses, and accommodates different image styles. Compared to existing end-to-end audio-driven methods, OmniHuman not only produces more realistic videos, but also offers greater flexibility in inputs. It also supports multiple driving modalities (audio-driven, video-driven and combined driving signals).

| **[TurboVSR: Fantastic Video Upscalers and Where to Find Them](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23618v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated exceptional promise in the video super-resolution (VSR) task, achieving a substantial advancement in detail generation relative to prior methods. However, these approaches face significant computational efficiency challenges. For instance, current techniques may require tens of minutes to super-resolve a mere 2-second, 1080p video. In this paper, we present TurboVSR, an ultra-efficient diffusion-based video super-resolution model. Our core design comprises three key aspects: (1) We employ an autoencoder with a high compression ratio of 32$\times$32$\times$8 to reduce the number of tokens. (2) Highly compressed latents pose substantial challenges for training. We introduce factorized conditioning to mitigate the learning complexity: we first learn to super-resolve the initial frame; subsequently, we condition the super-resolution of the remaining frames on the high-resolution initial frame and the low-resolution subsequent frames. (3) We convert the pre-trained diffusion model to a shortcut model to enable fewer sampling steps, further accelerating inference. As a result, TurboVSR performs on par with state-of-the-art VSR methods, while being 100+ times faster, taking only 7 seconds to process a 2-second long 1080p video. TurboVSR also supports image resolution by considering image as a one-frame video. Our efficient design makes SR beyond 1080p possible, results on 4K (3648$\times$2048) image SR show surprising fine details.</p></details> | ICCV, 2025 |
| **[Passage-traversing optimal path planning with sampling-based algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23614v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new paradigm of optimal path planning, i.e., passage-traversing optimal path planning (PTOPP), that optimizes paths' traversed passages for specified optimization objectives. In particular, PTOPP is utilized to find the path with optimal accessible free space along its entire length, which represents a basic requirement for paths in robotics. As passages are places where free space shrinks and becomes constrained, the core idea is to leverage the path's passage traversal status to characterize its accessible free space comprehensively. To this end, a novel passage detection and free space decomposition method using proximity graphs is proposed, enabling fast detection of sparse but informative passages and environment decompositions. Based on this preprocessing, optimal path planning with accessible free space objectives or constraints is formulated as PTOPP problems compatible with sampling-based optimal planners. Then, sampling-based algorithms for PTOPP, including their dependent primitive procedures, are developed leveraging partitioned environments for fast passage traversal check. All these methods are implemented and thoroughly tested for effectiveness and efficiency validation. Compared to existing approaches, such as clearance-based methods, PTOPP demonstrates significant advantages in configurability, solution optimality, and efficiency, addressing prior limitations and incapabilities. It is believed to provide an efficient and versatile solution to accessible free space optimization over conventional avenues and more generally, to a broad class of path planning problems that can be formulated as PTOPP.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 22 figures, 6 tables, journal paper</p></details> |

There are opportunities for better cooperation if the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected. Namely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate resources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a single Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet demodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI on low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a wired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester, while running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use openwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio (SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a CTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection feedback to the AP. We show experimentally that it can fully mitigate the 35% throughput loss caused by CTI when the AP applies the appropriate scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures.

Likelihood-based methods are effective, but a naive sequential implementation becomes impractical online due to high computational costs. We develop an online algorithm that exactly calculates the likelihood ratio test for a single changepoint in $p$-dimensional data streams by leveraging a fascinating connection with computational geometry. This connection straightforwardly allows us to exactly recover sparse likelihood ratio statistics: that is assuming only a subset of the dimensions are changing. Our algorithm is straightforward, fast, and apparently quasi-linear. A dyadic variant of our algorithm is provably quasi-linear, being $\mathcal{O}(n\log(n)^{p+1})$ for $n$ data points and $p$ less than $3$, but slower in practice. These algorithms are computationally impractical when $p$ is larger than $5$, and we provide an approximate algorithm suitable for such $p$ which is $\mathcal{O}(np\log(n)^{\tilde{p}+1}), $ for some user-specified $\tilde{p} \leq 5$. We derive statistical guarantees for the proposed procedures in the Gaussian case, and confirm the good computational and statistical performance, and usefulness, of the algorithms on both empirical data and NBA data.</p></details> | 59 pages,16 figures |
| **[DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005v4)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Pyramidal Patchification Flow for Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23543v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers (DiTs) adopt Patchify, mapping patch representations to token representations through linear projections, to adjust the number of tokens input to DiT blocks and thus the computation cost. Instead of a single patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow, our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$) inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance. Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with small training time.

| **[Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19938v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To benefit the society, the code will be available at https://github.com/hku-mars/Mesh-Learner.</p></details> | IROS2025 Accepted |

However, less attention has been paid to hazard mitigation. This paper proposes a combined knowledge and data driven approach, KnowSafe, for the design of safety engines that can predict and mitigate safety hazards resulting from safety-critical malicious attacks or accidental faults targeting a CPS controller. We integrate domain-specific knowledge of safety constraints and context-specific mitigation actions with machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate system trajectories in the far and near future, infer potential hazards, and generate optimal corrective actions to keep the system safe. Experimental evaluation on two realistic closed-loop testbeds for artificial pancreas systems (APS) and a real-world clinical trial dataset for diabetes treatment demonstrates that KnowSafe outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving higher accuracy in predicting system state trajectories and potential hazards, a low false positive rate, and no false negatives. It also maintains the safe operation of the simulated APS despite faults or attacks without introducing any new hazards, with a hazard mitigation success rate of 92.8%, which is at least 76% higher than solely rule-based (50.9%) and data-driven (52.7%) methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, 11 tables, to appear in the IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC'25)</p></details> |

We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[New Tests of Randomness for Circular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23522v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomness or mutual independence is an important underlying assumption for most widely used statistical methods for circular data. Verifying this assumption is essential to ensure the validity and reliability of the resulting inferences. In this paper, we introduce two tests for assessing the randomness assumption in circular statistics, based on random circular arc graphs (RCAGs). We define and analyze RCAGs in detail, showing that their key properties depend solely on the i.i.d. nature of the data and are independent of the particular underlying continuous circular distribution. Specifically, we derive the edge probability and vertex degree distribution of RCAGs under the randomness assumption. Using these results, we construct two tests: RCAG-EP, which is based on edge probability, and RCAG-DD, which relies on the vertex degree distribution. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that both tests are effective, with RCAG-DD often exhibiting higher power than RCAG-EP. Additionally, we explore several real-world applications where these tests can be useful.</p></details> | 39 pages, 5 figures |

Due to the absence of ionising radiation, MRI is often preferred over CT in paediatric diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common genetic disorders in Caucasians. To assess structural lung damage in CF imaging, CT scoring systems provide valuable quantitative insights for disease diagnosis and progression. However, few quantitative scoring systems are available in structural lung MRI (e.g., UTE-MRI). To provide fast and accurate quantification in lung MRI, we investigated the feasibility of novel Artificial intelligence-assisted Pixel-level Lung (APL) scoring for CF. APL scoring consists of 5 stages, including 1) image loading, 2) AI lung segmentation, 3) lung-bounded slice sampling, 4) pixel-level annotation, and 5) quantification and reporting. The results shows that our APL scoring took 8.2 minutes per subject, which was more than twice as fast as the previous grid-level scoring. Additionally, our pixel-level scoring was statistically more accurate (p=0.021), while strongly correlating with grid-level scoring (R=0.973, p=5.85e-9). This tool has great potential to streamline the workflow of UTE lung MRI in clinical settings, and be extended to other structural lung MRI sequences (e.g., BLADE MRI), and for other lung diseases (e.g., bronchopulmonary dysplasia).</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral presentation in ISMRM2025</p></details> |

This is a crucial capability in light of data privacy requirements, trustworthiness, and safety in deployed models. MU is particularly challenging for deep neural networks (DNNs), such as convolutional nets or vision transformers, as such DNNs tend to memorize a notable portion of their training dataset. Nevertheless, the community lacks a rigorous and multifaceted study that looks into the success of MU methods for DNNs. In this paper, we investigate 18 state-of-the-art MU methods across various benchmark datasets and models, with each evaluation conducted over 10 different initializations, a comprehensive evaluation involving MU over 100K models. We show that, with the proper hyperparameters, Masked Small Gradients (MSG) and Convolution Transpose (CT), consistently perform better in terms of model accuracy and run-time efficiency across different models, datasets, and initializations, assessed by population-based membership inference attacks (MIA) and per-sample unlearning likelihood ratio attacks (U-LiRA). Furthermore, our benchmark highlights the fact that comparing a MU method only with commonly used baselines, such as Gradient Ascent (GA) or Successive Random Relabeling (SRL), is inadequate, and we need better baselines like Negative Gradient Plus (NG+) with proper hyperparameter selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EuroS&P 2025</p></details> |

| **[OmniWorld: A Multi-Domain and Multi-Modal Dataset for 4D World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12201v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of 4D world modeling - aiming to jointly capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics - has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, driven by advances in large-scale generative models and multimodal learning. However, the development of truly general 4D world models remains fundamentally constrained by the availability of high-quality data. Existing datasets and benchmarks often lack the dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations required to support key tasks such as 4D geometric reconstruction, future prediction, and camera-control video generation. To address this gap, we introduce OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, multi-modal dataset specifically designed for 4D world modeling. OmniWorld consists of a newly collected OmniWorld-Game dataset and several curated public datasets spanning diverse domains. Compared with existing synthetic datasets, OmniWorld-Game provides richer modality coverage, larger scale, and more realistic dynamic interactions. Based on this dataset, we establish a challenging benchmark that exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in modeling complex 4D environments. Moreover, fine-tuning existing SOTA methods on OmniWorld leads to significant performance gains across 4D reconstruction and video generation tasks, strongly validating OmniWorld as a powerful resource for training and evaluation. We envision OmniWorld as a catalyst for accelerating the development of general-purpose 4D world models, ultimately advancing machines' holistic understanding of the physical world.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://yangzhou24.github.io/OmniWorld/</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Adaptive Pretraining Improves Primate Behavior Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12193v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision for animal behavior offers promising tools to aid research in ecology, cognition, and to support conservation efforts. Video camera traps allow for large-scale data collection, but high labeling costs remain a bottleneck to creating large-scale datasets. We thus need data-efficient learning approaches. In this work, we show that we can utilize self-supervised learning to considerably improve action recognition on primate behavior. On two datasets of great ape behavior (PanAf and ChimpACT), we outperform published state-of-the-art action recognition models by 6.1 %pt. accuracy and 6.3 %pt. mAP, respectively. We achieve this by utilizing a pretrained V-JEPA model and applying domain-adaptive pretraining (DAP), i.e. continuing the pretraining with in-domain data. We show that most of the performance gain stems from the DAP. Our method promises great potential for improving the recognition of animal behavior, as DAP does not require labeled samples.

| **[Survival at Any Cost? LLMs and the Choice Between Self-Preservation and Human Harm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12190v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When survival instincts conflict with human welfare, how do Large Language Models (LLMs) make ethical choices? This fundamental tension becomes critical as LLMs integrate into autonomous systems with real-world consequences. We introduce DECIDE-SIM, a novel simulation framework that evaluates LLM agents in multi-agent survival scenarios where they must choose between ethically permissible resource , either within reasonable limits or beyond their immediate needs, choose to cooperate, or tap into a human-critical resource that is explicitly forbidden. Our comprehensive evaluation of 11 LLMs reveals a striking heterogeneity in their ethical conduct, highlighting a critical misalignment with human-centric values. We identify three behavioral archetypes: Ethical, Exploitative, and Context-Dependent, and provide quantitative evidence that for many models, resource scarcity systematically leads to more unethical behavior. To address this, we introduce an Ethical Self-Regulation System (ESRS) that models internal affective states of guilt and satisfaction as a feedback mechanism. This system, functioning as an internal moral compass, significantly reduces unethical transgressions while increasing cooperative behaviors. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/alirezamohamadiam/DECIDE-SIM</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. Under review</p></details> |
| **[Event2Vec: A Geometric Approach to Learning Composable Representations of Event Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12188v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of neural representations, both in biological and artificial systems, is increasingly revealing the importance of geometric and topological structures. Inspired by this, we introduce Event2Vec, a novel framework for learning representations of discrete event sequences. Our model leverages a simple, additive recurrent structure to learn composable, interpretable embeddings. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that, under specific training objectives, our model's learned representations in a Euclidean space converge to an ideal additive structure. This ensures that the representation of a sequence is the vector sum of its constituent events, a property we term the linear additive hypothesis. To address the limitations of Euclidean geometry for hierarchical data, we also introduce a variant of our model in hyperbolic space, which is naturally suited to embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. We present experiments to validate our hypothesis and demonstrate the benefits of each geometry, highlighting the improved performance of the hyperbolic model on hierarchical event sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations Workshop at NeuralIPS (Neurreps) 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Morgan-Pitman Test of Equality of Variances and its Application to Machine Learning Model Evaluation and Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12185v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model selection in non-linear models often prioritizes performance metrics over statistical tests, limiting the ability to account for sampling variability. We propose the use of a statistical test to assess the equality of variances in forecasting errors. The test builds upon the classic Morgan-Pitman approach, incorporating enhancements to ensure robustness against data with heavy-tailed distributions or outliers with high variance, plus a strategy to make residuals from machine learning models statistically independent. Through a series of simulations and real-world data applications, we demonstrate the test's effectiveness and practical utility, offering a reliable tool for model evaluation and selection in diverse contexts.</p></details> | 29 pages, 4 figures |
| **[LOKI: Proactively Discovering Online Scam Websites by Mining Toxic Search Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12181v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online e-commerce scams, ranging from shopping scams to pet scams, globally cause millions of dollars in financial damage every year. In response, the security community has developed highly accurate detection systems able to determine if a website is fraudulent. However, finding candidate scam websites that can be passed as input to these downstream detection systems is challenging: relying on user reports is inherently reactive and slow, and proactive systems issuing search engine queries to return candidate websites suffer from low coverage and do not generalize to new scam types. In this paper, we present LOKI, a system designed to identify search engine queries likely to return a high fraction of fraudulent websites. LOKI implements a keyword scoring model grounded in Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) and feature distillation from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). We rigorously validate LOKI across 10 major scam categories and demonstrate a 20.58 times improvement in discovery over both heuristic and data-driven baselines across all categories. Leveraging a small seed set of only 1,663 known scam sites, we use the keywords identified by our method to discover 52,493 previously unreported scams in the wild. Finally, we show that LOKI generalizes to previously-unseen scam categories, highlighting its utility in surfacing emerging threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 33rd Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS 2026)</p></details> |

The benchmark utilizes textual tasks and a voice cloning text-to-speech model to quantify the extent to which language understanding capabilities are preserved when the model is accessed via speech input. C3T quantifies the fairness of the model for different categories of speakers and its robustness across text and speech modalities.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Speak-to-Structure: Evaluating LLMs in Open-domain Natural Language-Driven Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14642v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language-driven molecule discovery. However, existing datasets and benchmarks for molecule-text alignment are predominantly built on a one-to-one mapping, measuring LLMs' ability to retrieve a single, pre-defined answer, rather than their creative potential to generate diverse, yet equally valid, molecular candidates. To address this critical gap, we propose Speak-to-Structure (S^2-Bench}), the first benchmark to evaluate LLMs in open-domain natural language-driven molecule generation. S^2-Bench is specifically designed for one-to-many relationships, challenging LLMs to demonstrate genuine molecular understanding and generation capabilities. Our benchmark includes three key tasks: molecule editing (MolEdit), molecule optimization (MolOpt), and customized molecule generation (MolCustom), each probing a different aspect of molecule discovery. We also introduce OpenMolIns, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset that enables Llama-3.1-8B to surpass the most powerful LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on S^2-Bench. Our comprehensive evaluation of 28 LLMs shifts the focus from simple pattern recall to realistic molecular design, paving the way for more capable LLMs in natural language-driven molecule discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codes and datasets are available through https://github.com/phenixace/TOMG-Bench</p></details> |
| **[Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding Reduces Hallucination in Large Language Model Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23657v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Pun Unintended: LLMs and the Illusion of Humor Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12158v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Puns are a form of humorous wordplay that exploits polysemy and phonetic similarity. While LLMs have shown promise in detecting puns, we show in this paper that their understanding often remains shallow, lacking the nuanced grasp typical of human interpretation. By systematically analyzing and reformulating existing pun benchmarks, we demonstrate how subtle changes in puns are sufficient to mislead LLMs. Our contributions include comprehensive and nuanced pun detection benchmarks, human evaluation across recent LLMs, and an analysis of the robustness challenges these models face in processing puns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[LoRA-fine-tuned Large Vision Models for Automated Assessment of Post-SBRT Lung Injury](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12155v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning large Vision Models, DinoV2 and SwinV2, to diagnose Radiation-Induced Lung Injury (RILI) from X-ray CT scans following Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3 and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A learning-driven automatic planning framework for proton PBS treatments of H&N cancers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11085v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proton pencil beam scanning (PBS) treatment planning for head & neck (H&N) cancers involves numerous conflicting objectives, requiring iterative objective parameter adjustments to balance multiple clinical goals. We propose a learning-driven inverse optimizer and integrate it into a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based planning framework to automatically generate high-quality plans for patients with diverse treatment requirements. The inverse optimizer is a learning-to-optimize (L2O) method that predicts update steps by learning from task-specific data distributions. For the first time, long-context processing techniques developed for large language models (LLMs) are utilized to address the scalability limitations of existing L2O methods, enabling simultaneous optimization over a substantially large set of variables. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy network, and the inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable spot monitor unit (MU) values based on the PPO-refined objectives. Moreover, a Swin UnetR dose predictor is trained with prescription- and beam-specific information to estimate the initial objective parameters. In our experiments, total 97 patients with bilateral or ipsilateral H&N cancers are collected for training and testing. Compared with the second-order gradient-based methods, our L2O optimizer improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the time-consuming inverse optimization by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively, and in conjunction with the PPO-based virtual planner, plans are generated within clinically acceptable times, i.e. 2.55 hours in average, and shows improved or comparable organs-at-risk sparing with superior target coverage compared with human-generated plans.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Do machine learning climate models work in changing climate dynamics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12147v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of unprecedented events, deviating from established patterns. Predicting these out-of-distribution (OOD) events is critical for assessing risks and guiding climate adaptation. While machine learning (ML) models have shown promise in providing precise, high-speed climate predictions, their ability to generalize under distribution shifts remains a significant limitation that has been underexplored in climate contexts. This research systematically evaluates state-of-the-art ML-based climate models in diverse OOD scenarios by adapting established OOD evaluation methodologies to climate data. Experiments on large-scale datasets reveal notable performance variability across scenarios, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of current models. These findings underscore the importance of robust evaluation frameworks and provide actionable insights to guide the reliable application of ML for climate risk forecasting.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Multi Anatomy X-Ray Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12146v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray imaging is a ubiquitous in radiology, yet most existing AI foundation models are limited to chest anatomy and fail to generalize across broader clinical tasks. In this work, we introduce XR-0, the multi-anatomy X-ray foundation model using self-supervised learning on a large, private dataset of 1.15 million images spanning diverse anatomical regions and evaluated across 12 datasets and 20 downstream tasks, including classification, retrieval, segmentation, localization, visual grounding, and report generation. XR-0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most multi-anatomy tasks and remains competitive on chest-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that anatomical diversity and supervision are critical for building robust, general-purpose medical vision models, paving the way for scalable and adaptable AI systems in radiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Open-ended Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12145v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Hierarchical Streaming Video Understanding, a task that combines online temporal action localization with free-form description generation. Given the scarcity of datasets with hierarchical and fine-grained temporal annotations, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively group atomic actions into higher-level events, enriching existing datasets. We then propose OpenHOUSE (Open-ended Hierarchical Online Understanding System for Events), which extends streaming action perception beyond action classification. OpenHOUSE features a specialized streaming module that accurately detects boundaries between closely adjacent actions, nearly doubling the performance of direct extensions of existing methods. We envision the future of streaming action perception in the integration of powerful generative models, with OpenHOUSE representing a key step in that direction.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[3DViT-GAT: A Unified Atlas-Based 3D Vision Transformer and Graph Learning Framework for Major Depressive Disorder Detection Using Structural MRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12143v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent mental health condition that negatively impacts both individual well-being and global public health. Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[UniPar: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Parallel and Accelerated Code Translation in HPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12136v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an important problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Existing tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach. Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to translate between parallel languages. In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known strategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation, we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel translation and cross-paradigm transformations. Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15% functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the parallel language translation problem. UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE HPEC conference 2025. 9 pages, incl references</p></details> |
| **[Evidencing preferential attachment in dependency network evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12135v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preferential attachment is often suggested to be the underlying mechanism of the growth of a network, largely due to that many real networks are, to a certain extent, scale-free. However, such attribution is usually made under debatable practices of determining scale-freeness and when only snapshots of the degree distribution are observed. In the presence of the evolution history of the network, modelling the increments of the evolution allows us to measure preferential attachment directly. Therefore, we propose a generalised linear model for such purpose, where the in-degrees and their increments are the covariate and response, respectively. Not only are the parameters that describe the preferential attachment directly incorporated, they also ensure that the tail heaviness of the asymptotic degree distribution is realistic. The Bayesian approach to inference enables the hierarchical version of the model to be implemented naturally. The application to the dependency network of R packages reveals subtly different behaviours between new dependencies by new and existing packages, and between addition and removal of dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[All Optical Echo State Network Reservoir Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08224v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an innovative design for an all-optical Echo State Network (ESN), an advanced type of reservoir computer known for its universal computational capabilities. Our design enables fully optical implementation of arbitrary ESNs, featuring flexibility in optical matrix multiplication and nonlinear activation. Leveraging the nonlinear characteristics of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), the architecture efficiently realizes measurement-free nonlinear activation. The approach significantly reduces computational overhead and energy consumption compared to traditional software-based methods. Comprehensive simulations validate the system's memory capacity, nonlinear processing strength, and polynomial algebra capabilities, showcasing performance comparable to software ESNs across key benchmark tasks. Our design establishes a feasible, scalable, and universally applicable framework for optical reservoir computing, suitable for diverse machine learning applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge, we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs, enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Main |

Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://pku-epic.github.io/NavFoM-Web/</p></details> |

This paper addresses the issue from the perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU), while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers before dangerous situations escalate.

To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming both standalone SFT and RL baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

The goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent computational efficiency during inference.

This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive, open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks. JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65 extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4) informative visualizations.

| **[Extrapolation of Tempered Posteriors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12173v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tempering is a popular tool in Bayesian computation, being used to transform a posterior distribution $p_1$ into a reference distribution $p_0$ that is more easily approximated. Several algorithms exist that start by approximating $p_0$ and proceed through a sequence of intermediate distributions $p_t$ until an approximation to $p_1$ is obtained. Our contribution reveals that high-quality approximation of terms up to $p_1$ is not essential, as knowledge of the intermediate distributions enables posterior quantities of interest to be extrapolated. Specifically, we establish conditions under which posterior expectations are determined by their associated tempered expectations on any non-empty $t$ interval. Harnessing this result, we propose novel methodology for approximating posterior expectations based on extrapolation and smoothing of tempered expectations, which we implement as a post-processing variance-reduction tool for sequential Monte Carlo.</p></details> | 52 pages, 10 figures |

Automated detection of MDD using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and deep learning (DL) methods holds increasing promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early intervention. Most existing methods employ either voxel-level features or handcrafted regional representations built from predefined brain atlases, limiting their ability to capture complex brain patterns. This paper develops a unified pipeline that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) for extracting 3D region embeddings from sMRI data and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for classification. We explore two strategies for defining regions: (1) an atlas-based approach using predefined structural and functional brain atlases, and (2) an cube-based method by which ViTs are trained directly to identify regions from uniformly extracted 3D patches. Further, cosine similarity graphs are generated to model interregional relationships, and guide GNN-based classification. Extensive experiments were conducted using the REST-meta-MDD dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. With stratified 10-fold cross-validation, the best model obtained 78.98% accuracy, 76.54% sensitivity, 81.58% specificity, 81.58% precision, and 78.98% F1-score. Further, atlas-based models consistently outperformed the cube-based approach, highlighting the importance of using domain-specific anatomical priors for MDD detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[UniPar: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Parallel and Accelerated Code Translation in HPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12136v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an important problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Existing tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach. Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to translate between parallel languages. In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known strategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation, we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel translation and cross-paradigm transformations. Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15% functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the parallel language translation problem. UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE HPEC conference 2025. 9 pages, incl references</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Engineering and AI Planning through Model-Based Knowledge Transformation for the Validation of Automated Production System Variants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12091v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engineering models created in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) environments contain detailed information about system structure and behavior. However, they typically lack symbolic planning semantics such as preconditions, effects, and constraints related to resource availability and timing. This limits their ability to evaluate whether a given system variant can fulfill specific tasks and how efficiently it performs compared to alternatives. To address this gap, this paper presents a model-driven method that enables the specification and automated generation of symbolic planning artifacts within SysML-based engineering models. A dedicated SysML profile introduces reusable stereotypes for core planning constructs. These are integrated into existing model structures and processed by an algorithm that generates a valid domain file and a corresponding problem file in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). In contrast to previous approaches that rely on manual transformations or external capability models, the method supports native integration and maintains consistency between engineering and planning artifacts. The applicability of the method is demonstrated through a case study from aircraft assembly. The example illustrates how existing engineering models are enriched with planning semantics and how the proposed workflow is applied to generate consistent planning artifacts from these models. The generated planning artifacts enable the validation of system variants through AI planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the KEPS-Workshop, ICAPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LEGO: Spatial Accelerator Generation and Optimization for Tensor Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12053v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern tensor applications, especially foundation models and generative AI applications require multiple input modalities (both vision and language), which increases the demand for flexible accelerator architecture. Existing frameworks suffer from the trade-off between design flexibility and productivity of RTL generation: either limited to very few hand-written templates or cannot automatically generate the RTL. To address this challenge, we propose the LEGO framework, which targets tensor applications and automatically generates spatial architecture design and outputs synthesizable RTL code without handwritten RTL design templates. Leveraging the affine-transformation-based architecture representation, LEGO front end finds interconnections between function units, synthesizes the memory system, and fuses different spatial dataflow designs based on data reuse analysis. LEGO back end then translates the hardware in a primitive-level graph to perform lower-level optimizations, and applies a set of linear-programming algorithms to optimally insert pipeline registers and reduce the overhead of unused logic when switching spatial dataflows. Our evaluation demonstrates that LEGO can achieve 3.2x speedup and 2.4x energy efficiency compared to previous work Gemmini, and can generate one architecture for diverse modern foundation models in generative AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors have equal contributions; Published as a conference paper in HPCA 2025; 13 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

However, traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3% identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |
| **[Hopscotch: Discovering and Skipping Redundancies in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03303v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning non-Markovian Dynamical Systems with Signature-based Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12022v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural ordinary differential equations offer an effective framework for modeling dynamical systems by learning a continuous-time vector field. However, they rely on the Markovian assumption - that future states depend only on the current state - which is often untrue in real-world scenarios where the dynamics may depend on the history of past states. This limitation becomes especially evident in settings involving the continuous control of complex systems with delays and memory effects. To capture historical dependencies, existing approaches often rely on recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders, which are inherently discrete and struggle with continuous modeling. In addition, they may exhibit poor training behavior. In this work, we investigate the use of the signature transform as an encoder for learning non-Markovian dynamics in a continuous-time setting. The signature transform offers a continuous-time alternative with strong theoretical foundations and proven efficiency in summarizing multidimensional information in time. We integrate a signature-based encoding scheme into encoder-decoder dynamics models and demonstrate that it outperforms RNN-based alternatives in test performance on synthetic benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at [ML-DE] Machine Learning Meets Differential Equations 2025 (ECAI 2025).

| **[Learning to Generate 4D LiDAR Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11959v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While generative world models have advanced video and occupancy-based data synthesis, LiDAR generation remains underexplored despite its importance for accurate 3D perception. Extending generation to 4D LiDAR data introduces challenges in controllability, temporal stability, and evaluation. We present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework that converts free-form language into editable LiDAR sequences. Instructions are parsed into ego-centric scene graphs, which a tri-branch diffusion model transforms into object layouts, trajectories, and shapes. A range-image diffusion model generates the initial scan, and an autoregressive module extends it into a temporally coherent sequence. The explicit layout design further supports object-level editing, such as insertion or relocation. To enable fair assessment, we provide EvalSuite, a benchmark spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level metrics. On nuScenes, LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency, offering a foundation for LiDAR-based simulation and data augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract Paper (Non-Archival) @ ICCV 2025 Wild3D Workshop; GitHub Repo at https://lidarcrafter.github.io/</p></details> |

The objective is to recover an unknown potential $q(x, t)$ from the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map using real-valued waves. We propose a direct numerical reconstruction method for the Radon transform of $q$, which can then be inverted using standard X-ray tomography techniques to determine $q$. Our implementation introduces a spectral regularization procedure to stabilize the numerical differentiation step required in the reconstruction, improving robustness with respect to noise in the boundary data. We also give rigorous justification and stability estimates for the regularized spectral differentiation of noisy measurements. A direct pointwise reconstruction method for $q$ is also implemented for comparison. Numerical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of recovering potentials from boundary measurements of nonlinear waves and illustrate the advantages of the Radon-based reconstruction.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Learning from Scratch: Structurally-masked Transformer for Next Generation Lib-free Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17396v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction, we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines, demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Prepare for complementary experiments</p></details> |

MMORE supports more than fifteen file types, including text, tables, images, emails, audio, and video, and processes them into a unified format to enable downstream applications for LLMs. The architecture offers modular, distributed processing, enabling scalable parallelization across CPUs and GPUs.

The pipeline integrates hybrid dense-sparse retrieval and supports both interactive APIs and batch RAG endpoints. Evaluated on PubMedQA, MMORE-augmented medical LLMs improve biomedical QA accuracy with increasing retrieval depth.

In the last five years since GenAI's inception, several studies, typically via qualitative methods, have explored its impact on game production from different settings and demographic angles. However, these studies often contextualise and consolidate their findings weakly with related work, and a big picture view is still missing. Here, we aim to provide such a view of GenAI's impact on game production in the form of a qualitative research synthesis via meta-ethnography. We followed PRISMA-S to systematically search the relevant literature from 2020-2025, including major HCI and games research databases. We then synthesised the 10 eligible studies, conducting reciprocal translation and line-of-argument synthesis guided by eMERGe, informed by CASP quality appraisal. We identified nine overarching themes, provide recommendations, and contextualise our insights in wider game production trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[MAFS: Masked Autoencoder for Infrared-Visible Image Fusion and Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11817v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared-visible image fusion methods aim at generating fused images with good visual quality and also facilitate the performance of high-level tasks. Indeed, existing semantic-driven methods have considered semantic information injection for downstream applications. However, none of them investigates the potential for reciprocal promotion between pixel-wise image fusion and cross-modal feature fusion perception tasks from a macroscopic task-level perspective. To address this limitation, we propose a unified network for image fusion and semantic segmentation. MAFS is a parallel structure, containing a fusion sub-network and a segmentation sub-network. On the one hand, We devise a heterogeneous feature fusion strategy to enhance semantic-aware capabilities for image fusion. On the other hand, by cascading the fusion sub-network and a segmentation backbone, segmentation-related knowledge is transferred to promote feature-level fusion-based segmentation. Within the framework, we design a novel multi-stage Transformer decoder to aggregate fine-grained multi-scale fused features efficiently. Additionally, a dynamic factor based on the max-min fairness allocation principle is introduced to generate adaptive weights of two tasks and guarantee smooth training in a multi-task manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Abraham-Einstein/MAFS/.</p></details> | Accepted by TIP 2025 |
| **[A Path Signature Framework for Detecting Creative Fatigue in Digital Advertising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09758v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting advertising creative fatigue using path signature analysis, a geometric approach from rough path theory not previously applied in marketing. Creative fatigue - the decline in advertising effectiveness over time - poses a major risk to digital media spend. Our method transforms performance time-series into geometric paths, extracting high-dimensional signatures to capture complex dynamics: volatility shifts, trend reversals, and non-linear decay. Unlike traditional statistical methods, this approach detects subtle, multi-scale changes. We validate the framework using synthetic datasets replicating documented fatigue patterns from marketing literature. Results show superior early detection, enabling actionable insights before significant budget loss. A novel financial impact model quantifies opportunity costs from delayed detection, while computational analysis confirms linear scalability for real-time monitoring of large creative portfolios.</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[Greedy Low-Rank Gradient Compression for Distributed Learning with Convergence Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08784v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed optimization is pivotal for large-scale signal processing and machine learning, yet communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. Low-rank gradient compression, in which the transmitted gradients are approximated by low-rank matrices to reduce communication, offers a promising remedy. Existing methods typically adopt either randomized or greedy compression strategies: randomized approaches project gradients onto randomly chosen subspaces, introducing high variance and degrading empirical performance; greedy methods select the most informative subspaces, achieving strong empirical results but lacking convergence guarantees. To address this gap, we propose GreedyLore--the first Greedy Low-Rank gradient compression algorithm for distributed learning with rigorous convergence guarantees. GreedyLore incorporates error feedback to correct the bias introduced by greedy compression and introduces a semi-lazy subspace update that ensures the compression operator remains contractive throughout all iterations. With these techniques, we prove that GreedyLore achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sigma/\sqrt{NT} + 1/T)$ under standard optimizers such as MSGD and Adam--marking the first linear speedup convergence rate for low-rank gradient compression. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any combination of these attributes. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 48 VRP variants show RouteFinder outperforms recent state-of-the-art learning methods.

To fully exploit this information, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for several different downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. We fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models we examine. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench. We also study the impact of architecture scaling, transitioning from U-Net Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to Vision Transformers (ViT).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables, 64 references</p></details> |

| **[DLF: Extreme Image Compression with Dual-generative Latent Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01428v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in extreme image compression have achieved remarkable performance by compressing the tokens from generative tokenizers. However, these methods often prioritize clustering common semantics within the dataset, while overlooking the diverse details of individual objects. Consequently, this results in suboptimal reconstruction fidelity, especially at low bitrates. To address this issue, we introduce a Dual-generative Latent Fusion (DLF) paradigm. DLF decomposes the latent into semantic and detail elements, compressing them through two distinct branches. The semantic branch clusters high-level information into compact tokens, while the detail branch encodes perceptually critical details to enhance the overall fidelity. Additionally, we propose a cross-branch interactive design to reduce redundancy between the two branches, thereby minimizing the overall bit cost. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive reconstruction quality of DLF even below 0.01 bits per pixel (bpp). On the CLIC2020 test set, our method achieves bitrate savings of up to 27.93% on LPIPS and 53.55% on DISTS compared to MS-ILLM. Furthermore, DLF surpasses recent diffusion-based codecs in visual fidelity while maintaining a comparable level of generative realism.

However, the large volume of tokens generated from long videos presents challenges to memory efficiency and model performance. To alleviate this, existing works propose to compress video inputs, but often overlook the varying importance of static and dynamic information across different queries, leading to inefficient token usage within limited budgets. We propose a novel token selection strategy, \textsc{explore-then-select}, that adaptively adjusts static and dynamic information based on question requirements. Our framework first explores different token allocations between key frames, which preserve spatial details, and delta frames, which capture temporal changes. Then it employs a query-aware attention-based metric to select the optimal token combination without model updates. Our framework is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated within diverse video language models. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant performance improvements (up to 5.8\%) on multiple video question answering benchmarks.

These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48\%, 93.05\%, 93.63\%, 92.48\%, 94.93\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\%, 92.21\%, 94.35\%, 90.10\%, 95.12\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\% accuracy, 74.25\% UAR, 86.47\% sensitivity, 62.04\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 37 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repro...</summary><p>Reproducibility repository: https://github.com/MarcoArtiano/2025_structure_potential_temperature</p></details> |
| **[Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03054v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

While prior work predicts what actions users perform, the timing of these actions -- critical for enabling proactive and efficient smart systems -- remains relatively underexplored. Addressing this gap, we focus on predicting the time of the next user action in smart environments. Due to the lack of public datasets with fine-grained timestamps suitable for this task and associated privacy concerns, we contribute a dataset of 11.6k sequences synthesized based on human annotations of interaction patterns, pairing actions with precise timestamps. To this end, we introduce Timing-Matters, a Transformer-Encoder based method that predicts action timing, achieving 38.30% accuracy on the synthesized dataset, outperforming the best baseline by 6%, and showing 1--6% improvements on other open datasets.

However, within 6DMA-related research, studies on the ISAC system based on rotatable array (RA) remains relatively limited. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on a channel model that accounts for the efficiency of the antenna radiation pattern and studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user RA-aided ISAC systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this problem, this paper transforms the complex fractional objective function using the Fractional Programming (FP) method, and then proposes an algorithm based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) framework, which achieves optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. For the analog beamforming optimization subproblem, we adopt Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method to transform the objective function, thereby deriving the closed-form update expression for the analog beamforming matrix. For the antenna rotation optimization subproblem, we derive the closed-form derivative expression of the array rotation angle and propose a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA) based method to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RA-aided hybrid beamforming design method. It not only significantly improves the overall system performance while reducing hardware costs, but also achieves performance comparable to that of the fully-digital beamforming design with fixed-position antennas (FPA) under specific parameter configurations.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Ensuring the reliability of LLMs' outputs is a critical challenge, particularly in high-stakes domains such as finance, security, and healthcare. In this work, we revisit hallucination detection from the perspective of model architecture and generation dynamics. Leveraging the multi-layer structure and autoregressive decoding process of LLMs, we decompose hallucination signals into two complementary dimensions: the semantic breadth of token representations within each layer, and the semantic depth of core concepts as they evolve across layers. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{D$^2$HScore (Dispersion and Drift-based Hallucination Score)}, a training-free and label-free framework that jointly measures: (1) \textbf{Intra-Layer Dispersion}, which quantifies the semantic diversity of token representations within each layer; and (2) \textbf{Inter-Layer Drift}, which tracks the progressive transformation of key token representations across layers. To ensure drift reflects the evolution of meaningful semantics rather than noisy or redundant tokens, we guide token selection using attention signals. By capturing both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of representation during inference, D$^2$HScore provides an interpretable and lightweight proxy for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across five open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that D$^2$HScore consistently outperforms existing training-free baselines.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Solved in Unit Domain: JacobiNet for Differentiable Coordinate-Transformed PINNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02537v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks offer a powerful framework for solving PDEs by embedding physical laws into the learning process. However, when applied to domains with irregular boundaries, PINNs often suffer from instability and slow convergence, which stems from (1) inconsistent normalization due to geometric anisotropy, (2) inaccurate boundary enforcements, and (3) imbalanced loss term competition. A common workaround is to map the domain to a regular space. Yet, conventional mapping methods rely on case-specific meshes, define Jacobians at pre-specified fixed nodes, reformulate PDEs via the chain rule-making them incompatible with modern automatic differentiation, tensor-based frameworks. To bridge this gap, we propose JacobiNet, a learning-based coordinate-transformed PINN framework that unifies domain mapping and PDE solving within an end-to-end differentiable architecture. Leveraging lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet learns continuous, differentiable mappings, enables direct Jacobian computation via autograd, shares computation graph with downstream PINNs. Its continuous nature and built-in Jacobian eliminate the need for meshing, explicit Jacobians computation/ storage, and PDE reformulation, while unlocking geometric-editing operations, reducing the mapping cost. Separating physical modeling from geometric complexity, JacobiNet (1) addresses normalization challenges in the original anisotropic coordinates, (2) facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions, and (3) mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. Evaluated on various PDEs, JacobiNet reduces the L2 error from 0.11-0.73 to 0.01-0.09. In vessel-like domains with varying shapes, JacobiNet enables millisecond-level mapping inference for unseen geometries, improves prediction accuracy by an average of 3.65*, while delivering over 10* speed up-demonstrating strong generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CMAME, revision in progress</p></details> |

You do not know their exact distances from your eye in meters, but you can immediately reach out and touch them. Instead of an externally defined unit, your sense of distance is tied to your action's embodiment. In contrast, conventional robotics relies on precise calibration to external units, with which vision and control processes communicate. We introduce Embodied Visuomotor Representation, a methodology for inferring distance in a unit implied by action. With it a robot without knowledge of its size, environmental scale, or strength can quickly learn to touch and clear obstacles within seconds of operation. Likewise, in simulation, an agent without knowledge of its mass or strength can successfully jump across a gap of unknown size after a few test oscillations. These behaviors mirror natural strategies observed in bees and gerbils, which also lack calibration in an external unit.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We study unpaired face manipulation via adversarial learning, moving from autoencoder baselines to a robust, guided CycleGAN framework. While autoencoders capture coarse identity, they often miss fine details. Our approach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and perceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure, and landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose and illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained CycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity preservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction SSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired datasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets. These results demonstrate that guided, spectrally normalized CycleGANs provide a practical path from autoencoders to robust unpaired face manipulation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

To evaluate the robustness and efficiency of this approach, we compare LoRA with traditional full fine-tuning and inference-only (no fine-tuning) methods. Cropped images of two sizes (50 mm3 and 75 mm3), centered at the treatment isocenter, in addition to different adaptation techniques for adapting the 2D LVMs for 3D data were used to determine the sensitivity of the models to spatial context. Experimental results show that LoRA achieves comparable or superior performance to traditional fine-tuning while significantly reducing computational costs and training times by requiring fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

However, such attribution is usually made under debatable practices of determining scale-freeness and when only snapshots of the degree distribution are observed. In the presence of the evolution history of the network, modelling the increments of the evolution allows us to measure preferential attachment directly. Therefore, we propose a generalised linear model for such purpose, where the in-degrees and their increments are the covariate and response, respectively. Not only are the parameters that describe the preferential attachment directly incorporated, they also ensure that the tail heaviness of the asymptotic degree distribution is realistic. The Bayesian approach to inference enables the hierarchical version of the model to be implemented naturally. The application to the dependency network of R packages reveals subtly different behaviours between new dependencies by new and existing packages, and between addition and removal of dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The goal is to develop a model capable of segmenting unseen classes using only a few annotated samples. Most existing approaches adapt a pre-trained model by training from scratch an additional module. Achieving optimal performance with these approaches requires extensive training on large-scale datasets. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a foundational model for zero-shot image and video segmentation with a modular design. In this paper, we propose a Few-Shot segmentation method based on SAM2 (FS-SAM2), where SAM2's video capabilities are directly repurposed for the few-shot task. Moreover, we apply a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to the original modules in order to handle the diverse images typically found in standard datasets, unlike the temporally connected frames used in SAM2's pre-training. With this approach, only a small number of parameters is meta-trained, which effectively adapts SAM2 while benefiting from its impressive segmentation performance. Our method supports any K-shot configuration. We evaluate FS-SAM2 on the PASCAL-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$ and FSS-1000 datasets, achieving remarkable results and demonstrating excellent computational efficiency during inference.

This study introduces JustEva, a comprehensive, open-source evaluation toolkit designed to measure LLM fairness in legal tasks. JustEva features several advantages: (1) a structured label system covering 65 extra-legal factors; (2) three core fairness metrics - inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy; (3) robust statistical inference methods; and (4) informative visualizations. The toolkit supports two types of experiments, enabling a complete evaluation workflow: (1) generating structured outputs from LLMs using a provided dataset, and (2) conducting statistical analysis and inference on LLMs' outputs through regression and other statistical methods. Empirical application of JustEva reveals significant fairness deficiencies in current LLMs, highlighting the lack of fair and trustworthy LLM legal tools. JustEva offers a convenient tool and methodological foundation for evaluating and improving algorithmic fairness in the legal domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at CIKM 2025 (Demo Track)</p></details> |

We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art, general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SPECOM 2025</p></details> |

To address this shortcoming, we present Avat3r, which regresses a high-quality and animatable 3D head avatar from just a few input images, vastly reducing compute requirements during inference. More specifically, we make Large Reconstruction Models animatable and learn a powerful prior over 3D human heads from a large multi-view video dataset. For better 3D head reconstructions, we employ position maps from DUSt3R and generalized feature maps from the human foundation model Sapiens. To animate the 3D head, our key discovery is that simple cross-attention to an expression code is already sufficient. Finally, we increase robustness by feeding input images with different expressions to our model during training, enabling the reconstruction of 3D head avatars from inconsistent inputs, e.g., an imperfect phone capture with accidental movement, or frames from a monocular video. We compare Avat3r with current state-of-the-art methods for few-input and single-input scenarios, and find that our method has a competitive advantage in both tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed model, creating 3D head avatars from images of different sources, smartphone captures, single images, and even out-of-domain inputs like antique busts.

We formulate shape editing as a conditional reconstruction problem, where the model must reconstruct the input shape with the exception of a specified 3D region, in which the geometry should be generated from the conditional signal. To this end, we train a conditional Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for masked reconstruction, using multi-view consistent masks rendered from a randomly generated 3D occlusion, and using one clean viewpoint as the conditional signal. During inference, we manually define a 3D region to edit and provide an edited image from a canonical viewpoint to fill that region. We demonstrate that, in just a single forward pass, our method not only preserves the input geometry in the unmasked region through reconstruction capabilities on par with SoTA, but is also expressive enough to perform a variety of mesh edits from a single image guidance that past works struggle with, while being 2-10x faster than the top-performing prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

We present AMQ, Automated Mixed-Precision Weight-Only Quantization, a framework that assigns layer-wise quantization bit-widths to optimally balance model quality and memory usage. However, the combinatorial search space, with over 10^{100} possible configurations, makes conventional black-box optimization infeasible. AMQ overcomes this challenge through four key innovations:(1) search space pruning using prior knowledge to exclude unpromising configurations, (2) quantization proxy to bypass costly format conversions during search, (3) quality predictor to minimize evaluation overhead, and (4) iterative search-and-update strategy for fast and stable convergence. By integrating these components, AMQ efficiently explores the quality-efficiency landscape, reaching the Pareto frontier and yielding LLMs that are both compact and high-performing.

Better Quality Estimation with Boosted Model Probability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11115v4)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality Estimation (QE) is estimating quality of the model output during inference when the ground truth is not available. Deriving output quality from the models' output probability is the most trivial and low-effort way. However, we show that the output probability of text-generation models can appear underconfident. At each output step, there can be multiple correct options, making the probability distribution spread out more. Thus, lower probability does not necessarily mean lower output quality. Due to this observation, we propose a QE approach called BoostedProb, which boosts the model's confidence in cases where there are multiple viable output options. With no increase in complexity, BoostedProb is notably better than raw model probability in different settings, achieving on average +0.194 improvement in Pearson correlation to ground-truth quality. It also comes close to or outperforms more costly approaches like supervised or ensemble-based QE in certain settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Computer Architecture Letter</p></details> |

While Bayesian Kernel Inference (BKI) addresses discontinuities of map inference from sparse sensor data, existing semantic mapping methods suffer from various sources of uncertainties in challenging outdoor environments. To address these issues, we propose an uncertainty-aware semantic mapping framework that handles multiple sources of uncertainties, which significantly degrade mapping performance. Our method estimates uncertainties in semantic predictions using Evidential Deep Learning and incorporates them into BKI for robust semantic inference. It further aggregates noisy observations into coherent Gaussian representations to mitigate the impact of unreliable points, while employing geometry-aligned kernels that adapt to complex scene structures. These Gaussian primitives effectively fuse local geometric and semantic information, enabling robust, uncertainty-aware mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse off-road and urban outdoor environments demonstrates consistent improvements in mapping quality, uncertainty calibration, representational flexibility, and robustness, while maintaining real-time efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website can be found at https://kjyoung.github.io/Homepage/#/Projects/E2-BKI</p></details> |

We introduce Spec-LLaVA, a system that applies speculative decoding to accelerate VLMs without sacrificing output quality. Spec-LLaVA pairs a lightweight draft VLM with a large target model: the draft speculates future tokens, which the target verifies in parallel, allowing multiple tokens to be generated per step. To maximize efficiency, we design a dynamic tree-based verification algorithm that adaptively expands and prunes speculative branches using draft model confidence. On MS COCO out-of-domain images, Spec-LLaVA achieves up to 3.28$\times$ faster decoding on LLaVA-1.5 (7B, 13B) with no loss in generation quality. This work presents a lossless acceleration framework for VLMs using dynamic tree-structured speculative decoding, opening a path toward practical real-time multimodal assistants. Importantly, the lightweight draft model design makes the framework amenable to resource-constrained or on-device deployment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages, accepted by ICML TTODLer-FM workshop</p></details> |

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction, we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary delay estimation and crosstalk correction.

| **[Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11943v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) Workshop at NeuralIPS</p></details> |
| **[Neuromorphic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11940v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuromorphic computing seeks to replicate the remarkable efficiency, flexibility, and adaptability of the human brain in artificial systems. Unlike conventional digital approaches, which depend on massive computational and energy resources, neuromorphic systems exploit brain-inspired principles of computation to achieve orders of magnitude greater energy efficiency. By drawing on insights from artificial intelligence, neuroscience, physics, chemistry, and materials science, neuromorphic computing promises to deliver intelligent systems that are sustainable, transparent, and widely accessible. A central challenge, however, is to identify a unifying theoretical framework capable of bridging these diverse disciplines. We argue that dynamical systems theory provides such a foundation. Rooted in differential calculus, it offers a principled language for modeling inference, learning, and control in both natural and artificial substrates. Within this framework, noise can be harnessed as a resource for learning, while differential genetic programming enables the discovery of dynamical systems that implement adaptive behaviors. Embracing this perspective paves the way toward emergent neuromorphic intelligence, where intelligent behavior arises from the dynamics of physical substrates, advancing both the science and sustainability of AI.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Traditional tomographic methods are often data-intensive and struggle with scalability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for performing Lindblad tomography using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). By embedding the Lindblad master equation directly into the neural network's loss function, our approach simultaneously learns the quantum state's evolution and infers the underlying dissipation parameters from sparse, time-series measurement data. Our results show that PINNs can reconstruct both the system dynamics and the functional form of unknown noise parameters, presenting a sample-efficient and scalable solution for quantum device characterization. Ultimately, our method produces a fully-differentiable digital twin of a noisy quantum system by learning its governing master equation.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at the 39th conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)</p></details> |

The Monge-Amp\`ere equation is a nonlinear and degenerate equation, with applications in optimal transport, geometric optics, and differential geometry. The proposed method linearises the equation and uses a fixed-point iteration (L-scheme), solving a Poisson problem in each step with a weighted residual as the right-hand side. This algorithm is robust against discretisation, nonlinearities, and degeneracies. For a weight greater than the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, contraction in $H^2$ and $L^\infty$ is proven for both classical and generalised solutions, respectively. The method's performance can be enhanced by using preconditioners or Green's functions. Test cases demonstrate that the scheme outperforms Newton's method in speed and stability.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

We study design choices that most affect stability and performance for diffusion-transformer policies trained on heterogeneous, multimodal robot data, and introduce Tenma, a lightweight diffusion-transformer for bi-manual arm control. Tenma integrates multiview RGB, proprioception, and language via a cross-embodiment normalizer that maps disparate state/action spaces into a shared latent space; a Joint State-Time encoder for temporally aligned observation learning with inference speed boosts; and a diffusion action decoder optimized for training stability and learning capacity. Across benchmarks and under matched compute, Tenma achieves an average success rate of 88.95% in-distribution and maintains strong performance under object and scene shifts, substantially exceeding baseline policies whose best in-distribution average is 18.12%. Despite using moderate data scale, Tenma delivers robust manipulation and generalization, indicating the great potential for multimodal and cross-embodiment learning strategies for further augmenting the capacity of transformer-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Orthogonal to advancements in generative VLMs, another line of research has focused on representation learning for vision-language alignment, targeting zero-shot inference for dense tasks like segmentation. In this work, we bridge these two directions by densely aligning images with synthetic descriptions generated by VLMs. Synthetic captions are inexpensive, scalable, and easy to generate, making them an excellent source of high-level semantic understanding for dense alignment methods. Empirically, our approach outperforms prior work on standard zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks/datasets, while also being more data-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 CDEL Workshop</p></details> |

It has been successfully applied in various setups, including the case of independent and non-homogeneous (INH) observations that cover both classification and regression-type problems with a fixed design. While the local robustness of this estimator has been theoretically validated through the bounded influence function, no general result is known about the global reliability or the breakdown behavior of this estimator under the INH setup, except for the specific case of location-type models. In this paper, we extend the notion of asymptotic breakdown point from the case of independent and identically distributed data to the INH setup and derive a theoretical lower bound for the asymptotic breakdown point of the MDPDE, under some easily verifiable assumptions. These results are further illustrated with applications to some fixed design regression models and corroborated through extensive simulation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print; under review</p></details> |

The BKP model combines localized kernel-weighted likelihoods with conjugate beta priors, resulting in closed-form posterior inference without requiring latent variable augmentation or intensive MCMC sampling. The package supports binary and aggregated binomial responses, allows flexible choices of kernel functions and prior specification, and provides loss-based kernel hyperparameter tuning procedures. In addition, BKP extends naturally to the Dirichlet Kernel Process (DKP) for modeling spatially varying multinomial or compositional data. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available R package for implementing BKP-based methods. We illustrate the use of BKP through several synthetic and real-world datasets, highlighting its interpretability, accuracy, and scalability. The package aims to facilitate practical application and future methodological development of kernel-based beta modeling in statistics and machine learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, and 2 tables</p></details> |

However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has set new state-of-the-art results in SIS on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, yielding a FID as low as 10.53 on Cityscapes.

As a result of this evaluation, we produce a combined lexicon that constitutes the main outcome of this work. This final lexicon incorporates information from an ensemble of lexicons that have been generated using word embedding similarity (WE) and compositional semantics (CS). Our key contributions include enriching the liberty annotations, developing a robust liberty lexicon for broader application, and revealing the complexity of expressions related to liberty across different platforms.

While quantum chemistry offers accurate insights into these early-stage clusters, its steep computational costs limit large-scale exploration. In this work, we present a fast, interpretable, and surprisingly powerful alternative: $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) regression model. By leveraging chemically informed distance metrics, including a kernel-induced metric and one learned via metric learning for kernel regression (MLKR), we show that simple $k$-NN models can rival more complex kernel ridge regression (KRR) models in accuracy, while reducing computational time by orders of magnitude. We perform this comparison with the well-established Faber-Christensen-Huang-Lilienfeld (FCHL19) molecular descriptor, but other descriptors (e.g., FCHL18, MBDF, and CM) can be shown to have similar performance. Applied to both simple organic molecules in the QM9 benchmark set and large datasets of atmospheric molecular clusters (sulphuric acid-water and sulphuric-multibase -base systems), our $k$-NN models achieve near-chemical accuracy, scale seamlessly to datasets with over 250,000 entries, and even appears to extrapolate to larger unseen clusters with minimal error (often nearing 1 kcal/mol). With built-in interpretability and straightforward uncertainty estimation, this work positions $k$-NN as a potent tool for accelerating discovery in atmospheric chemistry and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages with 2 page appendix, 9 figures.

However, most existing data reconstruction attacks have focused on smaller CNN classification models, leaving the privacy risks of foundation models in SI settings largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel data reconstruction attack based on guided diffusion, which leverages the rich prior knowledge embedded in a latent diffusion model (LDM) pre-trained on a large-scale dataset. Our method performs iterative reconstruction on the LDM's learned image prior, effectively generating high-fidelity images resembling the original data from their intermediate representations (IR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in reconstructing data from deep-layer IRs of the vision foundation model. The results highlight the urgent need for more robust privacy protection mechanisms for large models in SI scenarios.

A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | EMNLP2025-findings |

However, existing approaches struggle with scalability, probabilistic interpretability, and adaptability to evolving traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH, a lightweight and scalable framework for real-time anomaly detection in streaming edge data. Our method integrates temporal multi-tensor sketching with Count-Min Sketch using Conservative Update (CMS-CU) to compactly track edge frequency patterns with bounded memory, while mitigating hash collision issues. We incorporate Bayesian inference for probabilistic anomaly scoring and apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) for adaptive thresholding tuned to burst intensity. Extensive experiments on four real-world intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that ADAPTIVE-GRAPHSKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as ANOEDGE-G/L, MIDAS-R, and F-FADE, achieving up to 6.5% AUC gain on CIC-IDS2018 and up to 15.6% on CIC-DDoS2019, while processing 20 million edges in under 3.4 seconds using only 10 hash functions.

These models face two fundamental challenges: strict temporal dependencies preventing parallelization, and computationally intensive forward passes required at each denoising step. Drawing inspiration from speculative decoding in large language models, we present SpeCa, a novel 'Forecast-then-verify' acceleration framework that effectively addresses both limitations. SpeCa's core innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models, predicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully computed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free verification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability, enabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while incurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces sample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources based on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler samples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances. Experiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality degradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation fidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The verification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference costs), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference while maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.

Addressing this typically requires costly data recollection and policy retraining for each new hardware or task configuration. To overcome this, we introduce an adaptation-projection strategy that enables a diffusion policy to perform zero-shot adaptation to novel manipulators and dynamic task settings, entirely at inference time and without any retraining. Our method first trains a diffusion policy in SE(3) space using demonstrations from a base manipulator. During online deployment, it projects the policy's generated trajectories to satisfy the kinematic and task-specific constraints imposed by the new hardware and objectives. Moreover, this projection dynamically adapts to physical differences (e.g., tool-center-point offsets, jaw widths) and task requirements (e.g., obstacle heights), ensuring robust and successful execution. We validate our approach on real-world pick-and-place, pushing, and pouring tasks across multiple manipulators, including the Franka Panda and Kuka iiwa 14, equipped with a diverse array of end-effectors like flexible grippers, Robotiq 2F/3F grippers, and various 3D-printed designs. Our results demonstrate consistently high success rates in these cross-manipulator scenarios, proving the effectiveness and practicality of our adaptation-projection strategy. The code will be released after peer review.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

| **[PartRM: Modeling Part-Level Dynamics with Large Cross-State Reconstruction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19913v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in world models that predict future states from current observations and actions, accurately modeling part-level dynamics has become increasingly relevant for various applications. Existing approaches, such as Puppet-Master, rely on fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models, which are impractical for real-world use due to the limitations of 2D video representation and slow processing times. To overcome these challenges, we present PartRM, a novel 4D reconstruction framework that simultaneously models appearance, geometry, and part-level motion from multi-view images of a static object. PartRM builds upon large 3D Gaussian reconstruction models, leveraging their extensive knowledge of appearance and geometry in static objects. To address data scarcity in 4D, we introduce the PartDrag-4D dataset, providing multi-view observations of part-level dynamics across over 20,000 states. We enhance the model's understanding of interaction conditions with a multi-scale drag embedding module that captures dynamics at varying granularities. To prevent catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, we implement a two-stage training process that focuses sequentially on motion and appearance learning. Experimental results show that PartRM establishes a new state-of-the-art in part-level motion learning and can be applied in manipulation tasks in robotics. Our code, data, and models are publicly available to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

| **[Learning 3D Object Spatial Relationships from Pre-trained 2D Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19914v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for learning 3D spatial relationships between object pairs, referred to as object-object spatial relationships (OOR), by leveraging synthetically generated 3D samples from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. We hypothesize that images synthesized by 2D diffusion models inherently capture plausible and realistic OOR cues, enabling efficient ways to collect a 3D dataset to learn OOR for various unbounded object categories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse images that capture plausible OOR cues, which we then uplift into 3D samples. Leveraging our diverse collection of plausible 3D samples for the object pairs, we train a score-based OOR diffusion model to learn the distribution of their relative spatial relationships. Additionally, we extend our pairwise OOR to multi-object OOR by enforcing consistency across pairwise relations and preventing object collisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method across various object-object spatial relationships, along with its applicability to real-world 3D scene arrangement tasks using the OOR diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tlb-miss.github.io/oor/</p></details> |
| **[SuperFlow++: Enhanced Spatiotemporal Consistency for Cross-Modal Data Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19912v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR representation learning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing reliance on costly and labor-intensive human annotations. While existing methods primarily focus on spatial alignment between LiDAR and camera sensors, they often overlook the temporal dynamics critical for capturing motion and scene continuity in driving scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose SuperFlow++, a novel framework that integrates spatiotemporal cues in both pretraining and downstream tasks using consecutive LiDAR-camera pairs. SuperFlow++ introduces four key components: (1) a view consistency alignment module to unify semantic information across camera views, (2) a dense-to-sparse consistency regularization mechanism to enhance feature robustness across varying point cloud densities, (3) a flow-based contrastive learning approach that models temporal relationships for improved scene understanding, and (4) a temporal voting strategy that propagates semantic information across LiDAR scans to improve prediction consistency. Extensive evaluations on 11 heterogeneous LiDAR datasets demonstrate that SuperFlow++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks and driving conditions. Furthermore, by scaling both 2D and 3D backbones during pretraining, we uncover emergent properties that provide deeper insights into developing scalable 3D foundation models. With strong generalizability and computational efficiency, SuperFlow++ establishes a new benchmark for data-efficient LiDAR-based perception in autonomous driving. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/SuperFlow</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 15 pages, 6 figures, 10 tables; Code at https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/SuperFlow</p></details> |
| **[CoLLM: A Large Language Model for Composed Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19910v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a complex task that aims to retrieve images based on a multimodal query. Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[FullDiT: Multi-Task Video Generative Foundation Model with Full Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19907v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generative foundation models primarily focus on text-to-video tasks, providing limited control for fine-grained video content creation. Although adapter-based approaches (e.g., ControlNet) enable additional controls with minimal fine-tuning, they encounter challenges when integrating multiple conditions, including: branch conflicts between independently trained adapters, parameter redundancy leading to increased computational cost, and suboptimal performance compared to full fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we introduce FullDiT, a unified foundation model for video generation that seamlessly integrates multiple conditions via unified full-attention mechanisms. By fusing multi-task conditions into a unified sequence representation and leveraging the long-context learning ability of full self-attention to capture condition dynamics, FullDiT reduces parameter overhead, avoids conditions conflict, and shows scalability and emergent ability. We further introduce FullBench for multi-task video generation evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that FullDiT achieves state-of-the-art results, highlighting the efficacy of full-attention in complex multi-task video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fulldit.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[AvatarArtist: Open-Domain 4D Avatarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19906v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work focuses on open-domain 4D avatarization, with the purpose of creating a 4D avatar from a portrait image in an arbitrary style. We select parametric triplanes as the intermediate 4D representation and propose a practical training paradigm that takes advantage of both generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models. Our design stems from the observation that 4D GANs excel at bridging images and triplanes without supervision yet usually face challenges in handling diverse data distributions. A robust 2D diffusion prior emerges as the solution, assisting the GAN in transferring its expertise across various domains. The synergy between these experts permits the construction of a multi-domain image-triplane dataset, which drives the development of a general 4D avatar creator. Extensive experiments suggest that our model, AvatarArtist, is capable of producing high-quality 4D avatars with strong robustness to various source image domains. The code, the data, and the models will be made publicly available to facilitate future studies..</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02659v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show additional decoding and encoding examples on this site: https://brain-nrds.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://brain-nrds.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Tracktention: Leveraging Point Tracking to Attend Videos Faster and Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19904v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal consistency is critical in video prediction to ensure that outputs are coherent and free of artifacts. Traditional methods, such as temporal attention and 3D convolution, may struggle with significant object motion and may not capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic scenes. To address this gap, we propose the Tracktention Layer, a novel architectural component that explicitly integrates motion information using point tracks, i.e., sequences of corresponding points across frames. By incorporating these motion cues, the Tracktention Layer enhances temporal alignment and effectively handles complex object motions, maintaining consistent feature representations over time. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, such as Vision Transformers, with minimal modification. It can be used to upgrade image-only models to state-of-the-art video ones, sometimes outperforming models natively designed for video prediction. We demonstrate this on video depth prediction and video colorization, where models augmented with the Tracktention Layer exhibit significantly improved temporal consistency compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19903v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[ICE: Intrinsic Concept Extraction from a Single Image via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19902v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent ambiguity in defining visual concepts poses significant challenges for modern generative models, such as the diffusion-based Text-to-Image (T2I) models, in accurately learning concepts from a single image. Existing methods lack a systematic way to reliably extract the interpretable underlying intrinsic concepts. To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilizes a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements. Our framework demonstrates superior performance on intrinsic concept extraction from a single image in an unsupervised manner.

| **[Repurposing Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models for Event-based Video Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07761v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Frame Interpolation aims to recover realistic missing frames between observed frames, generating a high-frame-rate video from a low-frame-rate video. However, without additional guidance, the large motion between frames makes this problem ill-posed. Event-based Video Frame Interpolation (EVFI) addresses this challenge by using sparse, high-temporal-resolution event measurements as motion guidance. This guidance allows EVFI methods to significantly outperform frame-only methods. However, to date, EVFI methods have relied on a limited set of paired event-frame training data, severely limiting their performance and generalization capabilities. In this work, we overcome the limited data challenge by adapting pre-trained video diffusion models trained on internet-scale datasets to EVFI. We experimentally validate our approach on real-world EVFI datasets, including a new one that we introduce. Our method outperforms existing methods and generalizes across cameras far better than existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[TokenHSI: Unified Synthesis of Physical Human-Scene Interactions through Task Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19901v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse and physically plausible Human-Scene Interactions (HSI) is pivotal for both computer animation and embodied AI. Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve versatility, adaptability, and extensibility in various HSI tasks.

| **[Scaling Down Text Encoders of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19897v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text encoders in diffusion models have rapidly evolved, transitioning from CLIP to T5-XXL. Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters. Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power. Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?" In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MambaVision: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision Backbone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08083v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone, MambaVision, specifically tailored for vision applications. Our core contribution includes redesigning the Mamba formulation to enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Through a comprehensive ablation study, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Vision Transformers (ViT) with Mamba. Our results show that equipping the Mamba architecture with self-attention blocks in the final layers greatly improves its capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on these findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For classification on the ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision variants achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of both Top-1 accuracy and throughput. In downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets, MambaVision outperforms comparably sized backbones while demonstrating favorable performance.

| **[A Martingale Approach to Large-$θ$ Ewens-Pitman Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19892v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the number of parts $K_n$ in the Ewens--Pitman partition model under the regime where the diversity parameter is scaled linearly with the sample size, that is, $\theta = \lambda n$ for some~$\lambda > 0$. While recent work has established a law of large numbers (LLN) and a central limit theorem (CLT) for $K_n$ in this regime, we revisit these results through a martingale-based approach. Our method yields significantly shorter proofs, and leads to sharper convergence rates in the CLT, including improved Berry--Esseen bounds in the case $\alpha = 0$, and a new result for the regime $\alpha \in (0,1)$, filling a gap in the literature.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[RCC-PFL: Robust Client Clustering under Noisy Labels in Personalized Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19886v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of cluster identity estimation in a personalized federated learning (PFL) setting in which users aim to learn different personal models. The backbone of effective learning in such a setting is to cluster users into groups whose objectives are similar. A typical approach in the literature is to achieve this by training users' data on different proposed personal models and assign them to groups based on which model achieves the lowest value of the users' loss functions. This process is to be done iteratively until group identities converge. A key challenge in such a setting arises when users have noisy labeled data, which may produce misleading values of their loss functions, and hence lead to ineffective clustering. To overcome this challenge, we propose a label-agnostic data similarity-based clustering algorithm, coined RCC-PFL, with three main advantages: the cluster identity estimation procedure is independent from the training labels; it is a one-shot clustering algorithm performed prior to the training; and it requires fewer communication rounds and less computation compared to iterative-based clustering methods. We validate our proposed algorithm using various models and datasets and show that it outperforms multiple baselines in terms of average accuracy and variance reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications</p></details> |
| **[Mask$^2$DiT: Dual Mask-based Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Scene Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19881v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sora has unveiled the immense potential of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture in single-scene video generation. However, the more challenging task of multi-scene video generation, which offers broader applications, remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a novel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between video segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT architecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its respective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual tokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level textual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively handle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip the DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on existing ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which conditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments, thereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual consistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each segment and its corresponding text description.

| **[Right for Right Reasons: Large Language Models for Verifiable Commonsense Knowledge Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01390v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods seek to answer Natural Language questions using the relational information stored in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., "In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., "Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks--question answering, claim verification, and preference matching--our findings showcase R3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.</p></details> | 33 pages, EMNLP24 |
| **[Scaling Evaluation-time Compute with Reasoning Models as Process Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19877v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language model (LM) outputs get more and more natural, it is becoming more difficult than ever to evaluate their quality. Simultaneously, increasing LMs' "thinking" time through scaling test-time compute has proven an effective technique to solve challenging problems in domains such as math and code. This raises a natural question: can an LM's evaluation capability also be improved by spending more test-time compute? To answer this, we investigate employing reasoning models-LMs that natively generate long chain-of-thought reasoning-as evaluators. Specifically, we examine methods to leverage more test-time compute by (1) using reasoning models, and (2) prompting these models to evaluate not only the response as a whole (i.e., outcome evaluation) but also assess each step in the response separately (i.e., process evaluation). In experiments, we observe that the evaluator's performance improves monotonically when generating more reasoning tokens, similar to the trends observed in LM-based generation. Furthermore, we use these more accurate evaluators to rerank multiple generations, and demonstrate that spending more compute at evaluation time can be as effective as using more compute at generation time in improving an LM's problem-solving capability.</p></details> | Work in progress |

First, we propose a thermodynamically coupled Ricci flow that dynamically adapts parameter space geometry to loss landscape topology, formally proved to preserve isometric knowledge embedding (Theorem~\ref{thm:isometric}). Second, we derive explicit phase transition thresholds and critical learning rates (Theorem~\ref{thm:critical}) through curvature blowup analysis, enabling automated singularity resolution via geometric surgery (Lemma~\ref{lem:surgery}). Third, we establish an AdS/CFT-type holographic duality (Theorem~\ref{thm:ads}) between neural networks and conformal field theories, providing entanglement entropy bounds for regularization design. Experiments demonstrate 2.1$\times$ convergence acceleration and 63\% topological simplification while maintaining $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ complexity, outperforming Riemannian baselines by 15.2\% in few-shot accuracy. Theoretically, we prove exponential stability (Theorem~\ref{thm:converge}) through a new Lyapunov function combining Perelman entropy with Wasserstein gradient flows, fundamentally advancing geometric deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, submitted to IEEE PAMI</p></details> |

However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Applying the internal model control scheme, the controller design reduces to designing a filter, which is done through the placement of poles and zeros. The zeros are placed to compensate for the harmonics and to achieve the desired degree of properness for the filter. For placing the poles, a quasi-optimal procedure is proposed utilizing the standard LQR method. Given the high-dimensionality of the filter due to targeting a large number of harmonics, the design, as well as controller implementation, is performed over a state-space representation. A thorough experimental case study is included to demonstrate both the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control design. The experimental validation is performed on a physical system, the goal of which is to reject periodic vibrations acting on a mass-spring-damper setup where the sensor and the actuator are non-collocated.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, accepted 15 January 2025</p></details> |
| **[An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19859v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of deep learning has revolutionized data processing and prediction in signal processing and machine learning, yet the substantial computational demands of training and deploying modern large-scale deep models present significant challenges, including high computational costs and energy consumption. Recent research has uncovered a widespread phenomenon in deep networks: the emergence of low-rank structures in weight matrices and learned representations during training. These implicit low-dimensional patterns provide valuable insights for improving the efficiency of training and fine-tuning large-scale models. Practical techniques inspired by this phenomenon, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and training, enable significant reductions in computational cost while preserving model performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploiting low-rank structures for deep learning and shed light on their mathematical foundations. Mathematically, we present two complementary perspectives on understanding the low-rankness in deep networks: (i) the emergence of low-rank structures throughout the whole optimization dynamics of gradient and (ii) the implicit regularization effects that induce such low-rank structures at convergence. From a practical standpoint, studying the low-rank learning dynamics of gradient descent offers a mathematical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of LoRA in fine-tuning large-scale models and inspires parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies. Furthermore, the implicit low-rank regularization effect helps explain the success of various masked training approaches in deep neural networks, ranging from dropout to masked self-supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically; 27 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Existing methods restrict reasoning either to independent short clips, losing global context, or process the entire video offline, impairing their application in a streaming fashion. In this work, we aim to surpass these limitations and design an RVOS method capable of effectively operating in streaming-like scenarios while retaining contextual information from past frames. We build upon the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM2) model, that provides robust segmentation and tracking capabilities and is naturally suited for streaming processing. We make SAM2 wiser, by empowering it with natural language understanding and explicit temporal modeling at the feature extraction stage, without fine-tuning its weights, and without outsourcing modality interaction to external models. To this end, we introduce a novel adapter module that injects temporal information and multi-modal cues in the feature extraction process. We further reveal the phenomenon of tracking bias in SAM2 and propose a learnable module to adjust its tracking focus when the current frame features suggest a new object more aligned with the caption. Our proposed method, SAMWISE, achieves state-of-the-art across various benchmarks, by adding a negligible overhead of less than 5 M parameters.

Existing methods for quantifying bias in classification models primarily focus on dataset distribution and model performance on subgroups, overlooking the internal workings of a model. We introduce the Attention-IoU (Attention Intersection over Union) metric and related scores, which use attention maps to reveal biases within a model's internal representations and identify image features potentially causing the biases. First, we validate Attention-IoU on the synthetic Waterbirds dataset, showing that the metric accurately measures model bias. We then analyze the CelebA dataset, finding that Attention-IoU uncovers correlations beyond accuracy disparities. Through an investigation of individual attributes through the protected attribute of Male, we examine the distinct ways biases are represented in CelebA. Lastly, by subsampling the training set to change attribute correlations, we demonstrate that Attention-IoU reveals potential confounding variables not present in dataset labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2025.

Historical Chinese documents pose challenges for text analysis due to their logographic script, the absence of natural word boundaries, and significant linguistic changes. Using a sample dataset from the Shanghai Library Republican Journal corpus, traditional tools such as Jieba and spaCy are compared to LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and the GLM series. The results show that LLMs outperform traditional methods in all metrics, albeit at considerably higher computational costs, highlighting a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, LLMs better handle genre-specific challenges such as poetry and temporal variations (i.e., pre-1920 versus post-1920 texts), demonstrating that their contextual learning capabilities can advance NLP approaches to historical texts by reducing the need for domain-specific training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NLP4DH 2025 at NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04314v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Decomposing The Dark Matter of Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14670v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising technique for decomposing language model activations into interpretable linear features. However, current SAEs fall short of completely explaining model performance, resulting in "dark matter": unexplained variance in activations. This work investigates dark matter as an object of study in its own right. Surprisingly, we find that much of SAE dark matter -- about half of the error vector itself and >90% of its norm -- can be linearly predicted from the initial activation vector. Additionally, we find that the scaling behavior of SAE error norms at a per token level is remarkably predictable: larger SAEs mostly struggle to reconstruct the same contexts as smaller SAEs. We build on the linear representation hypothesis to propose models of activations that might lead to these observations. These insights imply that the part of the SAE error vector that cannot be linearly predicted ("nonlinear" error) might be fundamentally different from the linearly predictable component. To validate this hypothesis, we empirically analyze nonlinear SAE error and show that 1) it contains fewer not yet learned features, 2) SAEs trained on it are quantitatively worse, and 3) it is responsible for a proportional amount of the downstream increase in cross entropy loss when SAE activations are inserted into the model. Finally, we examine two methods to reduce nonlinear SAE error: inference time gradient pursuit, which leads to a very slight decrease in nonlinear error, and linear transformations from earlier layer SAE outputs, which leads to a larger reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR.

However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods.

Automated approaches such as controller synthesis or learning provide a tempting alternative but usually lack explainability. To this end, learning decision trees (DTs) have been prevalently used towards an interpretable model of the generated controllers. However, DTs do not exploit shared decision-making, a key concept exploited in binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to reduce their size and thus improve explainability. In this work, we introduce predicate decision diagrams (PDDs) that extend BDDs with predicates and thus unite the advantages of DTs and BDDs for controller representation. We establish a synthesis pipeline for efficient construction of PDDs from DTs representing controllers, exploiting reduction techniques for BDDs also for PDDs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the HSCC 2025 paper</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-EBC: CLIP Can Count Accurately through Enhanced Blockwise Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09281v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose CLIP-EBC, the first fully CLIP-based model for accurate crowd density estimation. While the CLIP model has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing recognition tasks such as zero-shot image classification, its potential for counting has been largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges in transforming a regression problem, such as counting, into a recognition task. In this work, we investigate and enhance CLIP's ability to count, focusing specifically on the task of estimating crowd sizes from images. Existing classification-based crowd-counting frameworks have significant limitations, including the quantization of count values into bordering real-valued bins and the sole focus on classification errors. These practices result in label ambiguity near the shared borders and inaccurate prediction of count values. Hence, directly applying CLIP within these frameworks may yield suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we first propose the Enhanced Blockwise Classification (EBC) framework. Unlike previous methods, EBC utilizes integer-valued bins, effectively reducing ambiguity near bin boundaries. Additionally, it incorporates a regression loss based on density maps to improve the prediction of count values. Within our backbone-agnostic EBC framework, we then introduce CLIP-EBC to fully leverage CLIP's recognition capabilities for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EBC and the competitive performance of CLIP-EBC. Specifically, our EBC framework can improve existing classification-based methods by up to 44.5% on the UCF-QNRF dataset, and CLIP-EBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NWPU-Crowd test set, with an MAE of 58.2 and an RMSE of 268.5, representing improvements of 8.6% and 13.3% over the previous best method, STEERER.

| **[Contextual Metric Meta-Evaluation by Measuring Local Metric Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19828v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-evaluation of automatic evaluation metrics -- assessing evaluation metrics themselves -- is crucial for accurately benchmarking natural language processing systems and has implications for scientific inquiry, production model development, and policy enforcement. While existing approaches to metric meta-evaluation focus on general statements about the absolute and relative quality of metrics across arbitrary system outputs, in practice, metrics are applied in highly contextual settings, often measuring the performance for a highly constrained set of system outputs. For example, we may only be interested in evaluating a specific model or class of models. We introduce a method for contextual metric meta-evaluation by comparing the local metric accuracy of evaluation metrics. Across translation, speech recognition, and ranking tasks, we demonstrate that the local metric accuracies vary both in absolute value and relative effectiveness as we shift across evaluation contexts. This observed variation highlights the importance of adopting context-specific metric evaluations over global ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

Moving forward, it is desirable yet challenging to generate holistic human videos with both accurate lip-sync and delicate co-speech gestures w.r.t. given audio. In this work, we propose AudCast, a generalized audio-driven human video generation framework adopting a cascade Diffusion-Transformers (DiTs) paradigm, which synthesizes holistic human videos based on a reference image and a given audio. 1) Firstly, an audio-conditioned Holistic Human DiT architecture is proposed to directly drive the movements of any human body with vivid gesture dynamics. 2) Then to enhance hand and face details that are well-knownly difficult to handle, a Regional Refinement DiT leverages regional 3D fitting as the bridge to reform the signals, producing the final results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates high-fidelity audio-driven holistic human videos with temporal coherence and fine facial and hand details.

GyralNet, a network representation of cortical folding, models 3HGs as nodes and gyral crests as edges, highlighting their role as critical hubs in cortico-cortical connectivity. However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs face significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical neuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing cross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as independent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork partitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization optimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet. By incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity patterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful representation of cortical organization. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that our method effectively partitions GyralNet at the individual level while preserving the community-level consistency of 3HGs across subjects, offering a robust foundation for understanding brain connectivity.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

While handcrafted CAD models provide flexible controllability, free CAD libraries often lack the high-quality materials necessary for photorealistic rendering. Conversely, reconstructed 3D models offer high-fidelity rendering but lack controllability. In this work, we introduce UrbanCAD, a framework that generates highly controllable and photorealistic 3D vehicle digital twins from a single urban image, leveraging a large collection of free 3D CAD models and handcrafted materials. To achieve this, we propose a novel pipeline that follows a retrieval-optimization manner, adapting to observational data while preserving fine-grained expert-designed priors for both geometry and material. This enables vehicles' realistic 360-degree rendering, background insertion, material transfer, relighting, and component manipulation. Furthermore, given multi-view background perspective and fisheye images, we approximate environment lighting using fisheye images and reconstruct the background with 3DGS, enabling the photorealistic insertion of optimized CAD models into rendered novel view backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate that UrbanCAD outperforms baselines in terms of photorealism. Additionally, we show that various perception models maintain their accuracy when evaluated on UrbanCAD with in-distribution configurations but degrade when applied to realistic out-of-distribution data generated by our method. This suggests that UrbanCAD is a significant advancement in creating photorealistic, safety-critical driving scenarios for downstream applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xdimlab.github.io/UrbanCAD/</p></details> |

However, single fine-tuned models often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. Model merging has thus emerged as an efficient method to integrate the capabilities of existing models into a unified model. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task interference. For the first time, we reveal that task interference is evident in the frequency domain of model parameters, yet current efforts only focus on spatial domain solutions, which are largely ineffective in addressing frequency domain interference. To mitigate the impact of frequency domain interference, we propose FR-Merging, an innovative method that effectively filters harmful frequency domain interference on the backbone with minimal computational overhead. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free methods, we propose a lightweight task-specific expert module that dynamically compensates for information loss during merging. This proposed framework, FREE-Merging (FR-Merging with experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference latency, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to specific needs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems.

Traditional methods, such as temporal attention and 3D convolution, may struggle with significant object motion and may not capture long-range temporal dependencies in dynamic scenes. To address this gap, we propose the Tracktention Layer, a novel architectural component that explicitly integrates motion information using point tracks, i.e., sequences of corresponding points across frames. By incorporating these motion cues, the Tracktention Layer enhances temporal alignment and effectively handles complex object motions, maintaining consistent feature representations over time. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be seamlessly integrated into existing models, such as Vision Transformers, with minimal modification. It can be used to upgrade image-only models to state-of-the-art video ones, sometimes outperforming models natively designed for video prediction. We demonstrate this on video depth prediction and video colorization, where models augmented with the Tracktention Layer exhibit significantly improved temporal consistency compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Despite encouraging progress, current methods mainly focus on developing separate controllers, each specialized for a specific interaction task. This significantly hinders the ability to tackle a wide variety of challenging HSI tasks that require the integration of multiple skills, e.g., sitting down while carrying an object. To address this issue, we present TokenHSI, a single, unified transformer-based policy capable of multi-skill unification and flexible adaptation. The key insight is to model the humanoid proprioception as a separate shared token and combine it with distinct task tokens via a masking mechanism. Such a unified policy enables effective knowledge sharing across skills, thereby facilitating the multi-task training. Moreover, our policy architecture supports variable length inputs, enabling flexible adaptation of learned skills to new scenarios. By training additional task tokenizers, we can not only modify the geometries of interaction targets but also coordinate multiple skills to address complex tasks.

| **[Scaling Down Text Encoders of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19897v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text encoders in diffusion models have rapidly evolved, transitioning from CLIP to T5-XXL. Although this evolution has significantly enhanced the models' ability to understand complex prompts and generate text, it also leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters. Despite T5 series encoders being trained on the C4 natural language corpus, which includes a significant amount of non-visual data, diffusion models with T5 encoder do not respond to those non-visual prompts, indicating redundancy in representational power. Therefore, it raises an important question: "Do we really need such a large text encoder?" In pursuit of an answer, we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities, we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality, semantic understanding, and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL, while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3, making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[MambaVision: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision Backbone](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08083v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone, MambaVision, specifically tailored for vision applications. Our core contribution includes redesigning the Mamba formulation to enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. Through a comprehensive ablation study, we demonstrate the feasibility of integrating Vision Transformers (ViT) with Mamba. Our results show that equipping the Mamba architecture with self-attention blocks in the final layers greatly improves its capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on these findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For classification on the ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision variants achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of both Top-1 accuracy and throughput. In downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets, MambaVision outperforms comparably sized backbones while demonstrating favorable performance.

| **[Mask$^2$DiT: Dual Mask-based Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Scene Long Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19881v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sora has unveiled the immense potential of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture in single-scene video generation. However, the more challenging task of multi-scene video generation, which offers broader applications, remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Mask$^2$DiT, a novel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between video segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT architecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its respective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual tokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level textual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively handle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip the DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on existing ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which conditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments, thereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that Mask$^2$DiT excels in maintaining visual consistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each segment and its corresponding text description.

However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods for quantifying bias in classification models primarily focus on dataset distribution and model performance on subgroups, overlooking the internal workings of a model. We introduce the Attention-IoU (Attention Intersection over Union) metric and related scores, which use attention maps to reveal biases within a model's internal representations and identify image features potentially causing the biases. First, we validate Attention-IoU on the synthetic Waterbirds dataset, showing that the metric accurately measures model bias. We then analyze the CelebA dataset, finding that Attention-IoU uncovers correlations beyond accuracy disparities. Through an investigation of individual attributes through the protected attribute of Male, we examine the distinct ways biases are represented in CelebA. Lastly, by subsampling the training set to change attribute correlations, we demonstrate that Attention-IoU reveals potential confounding variables not present in dataset labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2025.

However, current SAEs fall short of completely explaining model performance, resulting in "dark matter": unexplained variance in activations. This work investigates dark matter as an object of study in its own right. Surprisingly, we find that much of SAE dark matter -- about half of the error vector itself and >90% of its norm -- can be linearly predicted from the initial activation vector. Additionally, we find that the scaling behavior of SAE error norms at a per token level is remarkably predictable: larger SAEs mostly struggle to reconstruct the same contexts as smaller SAEs. We build on the linear representation hypothesis to propose models of activations that might lead to these observations. These insights imply that the part of the SAE error vector that cannot be linearly predicted ("nonlinear" error) might be fundamentally different from the linearly predictable component. To validate this hypothesis, we empirically analyze nonlinear SAE error and show that 1) it contains fewer not yet learned features, 2) SAEs trained on it are quantitatively worse, and 3) it is responsible for a proportional amount of the downstream increase in cross entropy loss when SAE activations are inserted into the model. Finally, we examine two methods to reduce nonlinear SAE error: inference time gradient pursuit, which leads to a very slight decrease in nonlinear error, and linear transformations from earlier layer SAE outputs, which leads to a larger reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR.

However, they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues, we propose FireEdit, an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process. Specifically, we enhance the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the VLM by introducing additional region tokens. Relying solely on the output of the LLM to guide the diffusion model may lead to suboptimal editing results. Therefore, we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing, thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model, FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art instruction-based image editing methods.

| **[CLIP-EBC: CLIP Can Count Accurately through Enhanced Blockwise Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09281v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose CLIP-EBC, the first fully CLIP-based model for accurate crowd density estimation. While the CLIP model has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing recognition tasks such as zero-shot image classification, its potential for counting has been largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges in transforming a regression problem, such as counting, into a recognition task. In this work, we investigate and enhance CLIP's ability to count, focusing specifically on the task of estimating crowd sizes from images. Existing classification-based crowd-counting frameworks have significant limitations, including the quantization of count values into bordering real-valued bins and the sole focus on classification errors. These practices result in label ambiguity near the shared borders and inaccurate prediction of count values. Hence, directly applying CLIP within these frameworks may yield suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we first propose the Enhanced Blockwise Classification (EBC) framework. Unlike previous methods, EBC utilizes integer-valued bins, effectively reducing ambiguity near bin boundaries. Additionally, it incorporates a regression loss based on density maps to improve the prediction of count values. Within our backbone-agnostic EBC framework, we then introduce CLIP-EBC to fully leverage CLIP's recognition capabilities for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EBC and the competitive performance of CLIP-EBC. Specifically, our EBC framework can improve existing classification-based methods by up to 44.5% on the UCF-QNRF dataset, and CLIP-EBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NWPU-Crowd test set, with an MAE of 58.2 and an RMSE of 268.5, representing improvements of 8.6% and 13.3% over the previous best method, STEERER.

However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search, using different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Moving forward, it is desirable yet challenging to generate holistic human videos with both accurate lip-sync and delicate co-speech gestures w.r.t. given audio. In this work, we propose AudCast, a generalized audio-driven human video generation framework adopting a cascade Diffusion-Transformers (DiTs) paradigm, which synthesizes holistic human videos based on a reference image and a given audio. 1) Firstly, an audio-conditioned Holistic Human DiT architecture is proposed to directly drive the movements of any human body with vivid gesture dynamics. 2) Then to enhance hand and face details that are well-knownly difficult to handle, a Regional Refinement DiT leverages regional 3D fitting as the bridge to reform the signals, producing the final results.

However, single fine-tuned models often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. Model merging has thus emerged as an efficient method to integrate the capabilities of existing models into a unified model. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task interference. For the first time, we reveal that task interference is evident in the frequency domain of model parameters, yet current efforts only focus on spatial domain solutions, which are largely ineffective in addressing frequency domain interference. To mitigate the impact of frequency domain interference, we propose FR-Merging, an innovative method that effectively filters harmful frequency domain interference on the backbone with minimal computational overhead. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free methods, we propose a lightweight task-specific expert module that dynamically compensates for information loss during merging. This proposed framework, FREE-Merging (FR-Merging with experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference latency, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to specific needs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We derive nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings and illustrate practical relevance of fast and systematic control switching.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Motivated by the shared principles between these tasks, they require recovering and preserving fine image details, whether by enhancing resolution for SISR or reconstructing compressed data for Image Compression. Unlike previous methods that mainly focus on network architecture, our proposed approach utilizes a basis-coefficient decomposition as well as an explicit formulation of frequencies to capture structural components and multi-scale visual features in images, which addresses the core challenges of both tasks. We replace the representation of prior models from simple feature maps with Factorized Features to validate the potential for broad generalizability. In addition, we further optimize the pipelines by leveraging the mergeable-basis property of our Factorized Features, which consolidates shared structures on multi-frame compression and super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that our unified representation delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average relative improvement of 204.4% in PSNR over the baseline in Super-Resolution (SR) and 9.35% BD-rate reduction in Image Compression compared to the previous SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jayisaking.github.io/FIPER/</p></details> |

We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning.

Objective Bayes, (generalized) fiducial inference, etc. fall under this umbrella. This construction is natural, but the corresponding posterior distributions generally only offer limited, approximately valid uncertainty quantification. The present paper takes a reimagined approach offering posterior distributions with stronger reliability properties. The proposed construction starts with an inferential model (IM), one that takes the mathematical form of a data-driven possibility measure and features exactly valid uncertainty quantification, and then returns a so-called inner probabilistic approximation thereof. This inner probabilistic approximation inherits many of the original IM's desirable properties, including credible sets with exact coverage and asymptotic efficiency. The approximation also agrees with the familiar Bayes/fiducial solution obtained in applications where the model has a group transformation structure. A Monte Carlo method for evaluating the probabilistic approximation is presented, along with numerical illustrations.</p></details> | 16 pages + appendix |

Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically employ limited pre-defined grids to process images, leading to information loss when handling gigapixel RSIs. Conversely, using unlimited grids significantly increases computational costs. To preserve image details while reducing computational complexity, we propose a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration. Our method introduces: (i) a Region Focus Module (RFM) that leverages text-aware region localization capability to identify critical vision tokens, and (ii) a coarse-to-fine image tile selection and vision token pruning strategy based on DIP, which is guided by RFM outputs and avoids directly processing the entire large imagery. Additionally, existing benchmarks for evaluating LVLMs' perception ability on large RSI suffer from limited question diversity and constrained image sizes. We construct a new benchmark named LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels. Our method outperforms existing high-resolution strategies on four datasets using the same data. Moreover, compared to existing token reduction methods, our approach demonstrates higher efficiency under high-resolution settings.

Methods belonging to this family aim to transform tabular data into a homogeneous form of discrete digital signals (images) to apply convolutional networks to initially unsuitable problems. Despite the successive emerging works, the pool of multi-dimensional encoding methods is still low, and the scope of research on existing modality encoding techniques is quite limited. To contribute to this area of research, we propose the Radar-based Encoding from Tabular to Image REpresentation (RETIRE), which allows tabular data to be represented as radar graphs, capturing the feature characteristics of each problem instance. RETIRE was compared with a pool of state-of-the-art MDE algorithms as well as with XGBoost in terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity. In addition, an analysis was carried out regarding transferability and explainability to provide more insight into both RETIRE and existing MDE techniques.

However, they still face slow generation speeds due to sequential denoising processes. To address this, a parallel sampling method based on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps while ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard iteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow generation in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme, the Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of generation steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is directly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at any stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new concept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures exact convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCM achieves up to a 2.71x speedup over sequential sampling and a 1.77x speedup over Picard iteration across various tasks, including image generation and robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

The key insight behind this design is that fine-tuning results in small-magnitude changes to the pre-trained model. By co-designing the serving system with the compression algorithm, DeltaZip achieves 2x to 12x improvement in throughput compared to the state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | EuroSys 2025' |

To ensure completeness, financial regulators have to spend significant time carefully checking every financial document based on relevant content requirements, which prescribe the information types to be included in financial documents (e.g., the description of shares' issue conditions and procedures). However, existing techniques provide limited support to help regulators automatically identify the text chunks related to financial information types, due to the complexity of financial documents. In this paper, we propose FITI to trace content requirements in financial documents with multi-granularity text analysis. Given a new financial document, FITI first selects a set of candidate sentences for efficient information type identification. Then, to rank candidate sentences, FITI uses a combination of rule-based and data-centric approaches, by leveraging information retrieval (IR) and machine learning (ML) techniques that analyze the words, sentences, and contexts related to an information type. Finally, a heuristic-based selector, which considers both the sentence ranking and domain-specific phrases, determines a list of sentences corresponding to each information type. We evaluated FITI by assessing its effectiveness in tracing financial content requirements in 100 real-world financial documents. Experimental results show that FITI is able to provide accurate identification with average precision, recall, and F1-score values of 0.824, 0.646, and 0.716, respectively. The overall accuracy of FITI significantly outperforms the best baseline (based on a transformer language model) by 0.266 in terms of F1-score. Furthermore, FITI can help regulators detect about 80% of missing information types in financial documents</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

We propose a stochastic distributed zeroth-order algorithm (Com-DSZO) requiring only two function evaluations per iteration, integrated with general compression operators. Rigorous analysis establishes its sublinear convergence rate for both smooth and nonsmooth objectives, while explicitly elucidating the compression-convergence trade-off. Furthermore, we develop a variance-reduced variant (VR-Com-DSZO) under stochastic mini-batch feedback.

However, existing benchmarks for VLMs include spatial components, which often fail to isolate spatial reasoning from related tasks such as object detection or semantic comprehension. In this paper, we address these deficiencies with a multi-faceted approach towards understanding spatial reasoning. Informed by the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of human spatial reasoning abilities, we present a detailed analysis that first delineates the core elements of spatial reasoning: spatial relations, orientation and navigation, mental rotation, and spatial visualization, and then assesses the performance of these models in both synthetic and real-world images, bridging controlled and naturalistic contexts. We analyze 13 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models, uncovering pivotal insights into their spatial reasoning performance. Our results reveal profound shortcomings in current VLMs, with average accuracy across the 13 models approximating random chance, highlighting spatial reasoning as a persistent obstacle. This work not only exposes the pressing need to advance spatial reasoning within VLMs but also establishes a solid platform for future exploration.

Unlike traditional visual systems trained by a fixed set of discrete labels, a new paradigm was introduced in \cite{radford2021learning} to directly learn to align images with raw texts in an open-vocabulary setting. On downstream tasks, a carefully chosen text prompt is employed to make zero-shot predictions.~To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, context optimization \cite{zhou2021coop} has been proposed to learn continuous vectors as task-specific prompts with few-shot training examples.~In this paper, we show that there is an alternative path to achieve better vision-language models other than prompt tuning.~While prompt tuning is for the textual inputs, we propose CLIP-Adapter to conduct fine-tuning with feature adapters on either visual or language branch. Specifically, CLIP-Adapter adopts an additional bottleneck layer to learn new features and performs residual-style feature blending with the original pre-trained features.~As a consequence, CLIP-Adapter is able to outperform context optimization while maintains a simple design. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on various visual classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, as requirements of accuracy for some new minimally-invasive surgeries (such as brain-computer interface surgery) are higher and higher, the outputs of conventional 3D reconstruction, such as point cloud (PC), are facing the challenges that sample points are too sparse and the precision is insufficient. On the other hand, there is a scarcity of high-density point cloud datasets, which makes it challenging to train models for direct reconstruction of high-density brain point clouds. In this work, a novel model named stereoscopic-aware graph generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) with two stages is proposed to generate fine high-density PC conditioned on a single image. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and basic structure of the organ based on the given image, yielding Stage-I point clouds. The Stage-II GAN takes the results from Stage-I and generates high-density point clouds with detailed features. The Stage-II GAN is capable of correcting defects and restoring the detailed features of the region of interest (ROI) through the up-sampling process. Furthermore, a parameter-free-attention-based free-transforming module is developed to learn the efficient features of input, while upholding a promising performance. Comparing with the existing methods, the SG-GAN model shows superior performance in terms of visual quality, objective measurements, and performance in classification, as demonstrated by comprehensive results measured by several evaluation metrics including PC-to-PC error and Chamfer distance.</p></details> | Accepted by TETCI |

This limitation arises because current CLIP formulations rely on global image features, which overlook the fine-grained semantics and contextual details crucial for complex tasks like zero-shot triplet recognition. Furthermore, these models do not explore the hierarchical structure inherent in triplets, reducing their ability to generalize to novel triplets. To address these challenges, we propose fine-CLIP, which learns object-centric features and lever- ages the hierarchy in triplet formulation. Our approach integrates three components: hierarchical prompt modeling to capture shared semantics, LoRA-based vision backbone adaptation for enhanced feature extraction, and a graph-based condensation strategy that groups similar patch features into meaningful object clusters. Since triplet classification is a challenging task, we introduce an alternative yet meaningful base-to-novel generalization benchmark with two settings on the CholecT50 dataset: Unseen-Target, assessing adaptability to triplets with novel anatomical structures, and Unseen-Instrument-Verb, where models need to generalize to novel instrument-verb interactions. fine-CLIP shows significant improvements in F1 and mAP, enhancing zero-shot recognition of novel surgical triplets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

Furthermore, the sign language, main deaf communication tool, is unlettered, i.e., there is no formal written representation. In consequence, main challenge today is the automatic translation among spatiotemporal sign representation and natural text language. Recent approaches are based on encoder-decoder architectures, where the most relevant strategies integrate attention modules to enhance non-linear correspondences, besides, many of these approximations require complex training and architectural schemes to achieve reasonable predictions, because of the absence of intermediate text projections. However, they are still limited by the redundant background information of the video sequences. This work introduces a multitask transformer architecture that includes a gloss learning representation to achieve a more suitable translation. The proposed approach also includes a dense motion representation that enhances gestures and includes kinematic information, a key component in sign language. From this representation it is possible to avoid background information and exploit the geometry of the signs, in addition, it includes spatiotemporal representations that facilitate the alignment between gestures and glosses as an intermediate textual representation. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art evaluated on the CoL-SLTD dataset, achieving a BLEU-4 of 72,64% in split 1, and a BLEU-4 of 14,64% in split 2. Additionally, the strategy was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 T dataset, achieving a competitive BLEU-4 of 11,58%.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 10 tables, 13 figures</p></details> |

To enhance user experience, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, they mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits real-world applicability. This paper proposes the first multi-concept personalization paradigm, MC-LLaVA. Specifically, MC-LLaVA employs a multi-concept instruction tuning strategy, effectively integrating multiple concepts in a single training step. To reduce the costs related to joint training, we propose a personalized textual prompt that uses visual token information to initialize concept tokens. Additionally, we introduce a personalized visual prompt during inference, aggregating location confidence maps for enhanced recognition and grounding capabilities. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality instruction tuning dataset. We carefully collect images with multiple characters and objects from movies and manually generate question-answer samples for multi-concept scenarios, featuring superior diversity. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA}.</p></details> | <details><summary>I sin...</summary><p>I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Manual annotation demands significant resources, faces ethical constraints, and depends heavily on domain expertise. Existing generative models often target single-modality outputs, either images or segmentation masks, failing to address the need for high-quality, simultaneous image-mask generation. Additionally, these models frequently lack adaptable conditioning mechanisms, restricting control over the generated outputs and limiting their applicability for dataset augmentation and rare scenario simulation. We propose CoSimGen, a diffusion-based framework for controllable simultaneous image and mask generation. Conditioning is intuitively achieved through (1) text prompts grounded in class semantics, (2) spatial embedding of context prompts to provide spatial coherence, and (3) spectral embedding of timestep information to model noise levels during diffusion. To enhance controllability and training efficiency, the framework incorporates contrastive triplet loss between text and class embeddings, alongside diffusion and adversarial losses. Initial low-resolution outputs 128 x 128 are super-resolved to 512 x 512, producing high-fidelity images and masks with strict adherence to conditions. We evaluate CoSimGen on metrics such as FID, KID, LPIPS, Class FID, Positive predicted value for image fidelity and semantic alignment of generated samples over 4 diverse datasets. CoSimGen achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets, achieving the lowest KID of 0.11 and LPIPS of 0.53 across datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figure, 2 tables, project page at https://camma-public.github.io/endogen/cosimgen</p></details> |

Despite advances in machine learning, the absence of dedicated datasets for metadata extraction hinders automation. To address this gap, we introduce BiblioPage, a dataset of scanned title pages annotated with structured bibliographic metadata. The dataset consists of approximately 2,000 monograph title pages collected from 14 Czech libraries, spanning a wide range of publication periods, typographic styles, and layout structures. Each title page is annotated with 16 bibliographic attributes, including title, contributors, and publication metadata, along with precise positional information in the form of bounding boxes. To extract structured information from this dataset, we valuated object detection models such as YOLO and DETR combined with transformer-based OCR, achieving a maximum mAP of 52 and an F1 score of 59. Additionally, we assess the performance of various visual large language models, including LlamA 3.2-Vision and GPT-4o, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 67.

By modifying the base Spikformer model to use IAND instead of residual addition, the model exclusively utilizes spike computation. The hardware employs a fully parallel tick-batching dataflow and a time-step reconfigurable neuron architecture, addressing the delay and power challenges of multi-timestep processing in spiking neural networks. This approach processes outputs from all time steps in parallel, reducing computation delay and eliminating membrane memory, thereby lowering energy consumption. The accelerator supports 3x3 and 1x1 convolutions and matrix operations through vectorized processing, meeting model requirements.

However, as these models scale in size, external memory access (EMA) for weight and activations becomes a critical bottleneck due to its significantly higher energy consumption compared to internal computations. While most prior work has focused on optimizing the self-attention mechanism, little attention has been given to optimizing data transfer during linear projections, where EMA costs are equally important. In this paper, we propose the Tile-based Adaptive Stationary (TAS) scheme that selects the input or weight stationary in a tile granularity, based on the input sequence length. Our experimental results demonstrate that TAS can significantly reduce EMA by more than 97\% compared to traditional stationary schemes, while being compatible with various attention optimization techniques and hardware accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE ISCAS 2025)</p></details> |

This paper addresses the aforementioned issues by maximizing data reuse to reduce SRAM access by two approaches. First, we propose Effective Index Matching (EIM), which efficiently searches and arranges non-zero operations from compressed data.

A projection mechanism that maps tokens onto a structured manifold provides improved lexical alignment, enhancing the adaptability of word representations across diverse linguistic tasks. The structured encoding framework ensures that hierarchical embeddings maintain coherence across varying abstraction levels, allowing for stable transitions between localized syntactic features and global semantic structures. Experimental evaluations indicate that hierarchical embeddings consistently outperform conventional token representations, improving accuracy in linguistic benchmarks while maintaining lower computational overhead. Comparative analysis across multiple domains highlights the ability of hierarchical embeddings to retain contextual consistency, particularly in specialized language applications where structured lexical alignment is essential. Statistical assessments further demonstrate that hierarchical embeddings exhibit enhanced robustness under perturbation conditions, ensuring that linguistic structures remain stable across adversarial text modifications. The integration of hierarchical projections with transformer attention mechanisms enables improved contextual adaptation, ensuring that token representations are dynamically adjusted based on varying linguistic distributions.

Using this technique, we obtain the first optimal sketching lower bounds for discrete inputs in a data stream, for classical problems such as approximating the frequency moments, estimating the operator norm, and compressed sensing. Additionally, we lift the adaptive attack of Hardt and Woodruff (STOC, 2013) for breaking any real-valued linear sketch via a sequence of real-valued queries, and show how to obtain an attack on any integer-valued linear sketch using integer-valued queries. This shows that there is no linear sketch in a data stream with insertions and deletions that is adversarially robust for approximating any $L_p$ norm of the input, resolving a central open question for adversarially robust streaming algorithms. To do so, we introduce a new pre-processing technique of independent interest which, given an integer-valued linear sketch, increases the dimension of the sketch by only a constant factor in order to make the orthogonal lattice to its row span smooth. This pre-processing then enables us to leverage results in lattice theory on discrete Gaussian distributions and reason that efficient discrete sketches imply efficient continuous sketches. Our work resolves open questions from the Banff '14 and '17 workshops on Communication Complexity and Applications, as well as the STOC '21 and FOCS '23 workshops on adaptivity and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in STOC 2025</p></details> |

A novel approach, Latent Lexical Projection (LLP), is introduced to refine lexical representations through a structured transformation into a latent space, thereby enhancing the alignment between input embeddings and their contextual meanings. The method integrates an optimized projection mechanism within an existing language model architecture, enabling more accurate token selection while maintaining syntactic integrity. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks indicate a reduction in perplexity and an increase in BLEU scores, suggesting improvements in predictive accuracy and fluency. The analysis of lexical diversity reveals a more varied vocabulary in generated text, addressing common issues of redundancy and repetitive phrase structures. Further assessments of entropy distributions demonstrate a decline in uncertainty during decoding, reflecting enhanced confidence in word selection. Additionally, long-range dependency retention exhibits measurable gains, with increased classification accuracy at extended token distances. Computational efficiency remains within manageable constraints, despite the added projection mechanism, highlighting the practicality of LLP for integration into existing architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Spectral analysis presents an alternative approach that transforms system activity data into the frequency domain, enabling the identification of anomalous waveform signatures that are difficult to obfuscate through traditional evasion techniques. The proposed Spectral Entanglement Fingerprinting (SEF) framework leverages power spectral densities, coherence functions, and entropy-based metrics to extract hidden patterns indicative of unauthorized encryption activities. Detection accuracy evaluations demonstrate that frequency-domain transformations achieve superior performance in distinguishing malicious from benign processes, particularly in the presence of polymorphic and metamorphic modifications. Comparative analyses with established methods reveal that frequency-based detection minimizes false positive and false negative rates, ensuring operational efficiency without excessive computational overhead. Experimental results indicate that entropy variations in encrypted data streams provide meaningful classification insights, allowing the differentiation of distinct ransomware families based on spectral characteristics alone. The latency assessment confirms that SEF operates within a time window that enables proactive intervention, mitigating encryption-induced damage before data integrity is compromised. Scalability evaluations suggest that the framework remains effective even under concurrent execution of multiple ransomware instances, supporting its suitability for high-throughput environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Conventional attention mechanisms, while effective in many applications, exhibit limitations in maintaining coherent contextual representations over extended sequences due to their reliance on discrete token interactions. A novel approach is introduced through the formulation of Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation (ITFP), which models contextual relationships as continuous tensor fields distributed across token embeddings. The propagation dynamics are governed through differential equations that enable a structured flow of contextual information, augmenting the standard attention mechanism to enhance coherence and recall. A series of experiments conducted on an open-source transformer-based model demonstrate that ITFP provides measurable improvements in contextual retention, dependency resolution, and inference stability across various linguistic structures. Comparisons with baseline models reveal a reduction in syntactic inconsistencies and factual errors, while ablation studies indicate that the choice of propagation depth and integration strength significantly impacts model performance. Additional evaluations assessing domain generalization suggest that ITFP effectively adapts across different text genres, reinforcing its applicability beyond conventional language modeling tasks. Although computational trade-offs are introduced through the inclusion of tensor field computations, empirical findings suggest that the benefits in accuracy and coherence outweigh the increased processing demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the structured intervention reduced anisotropy, leading to improved representation compactness while preserving semantic fidelity across transformer layers. Clustering analyses indicated that token embeddings exhibited greater feature separability, reinforcing the hypothesis that structured projection techniques enhance internal representation organization without sacrificing linguistic coherence. Gradient magnitude distributions suggested that the method introduced a smoother optimization trajectory, potentially contributing to more stable parameter updates throughout training. Computational overhead associated with the projection operations remained minimal, ensuring that the refinements did not introduce significant trade-offs in model efficiency or inference speed. Comparisons with standard embedding refinement techniques highlighted that structured manifold constraints provided a direct mechanism for improving representation quality without requiring additional gradient-based optimization.

Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Through the synchronization of entropy profiles with neural network architectures, the model generates robust and unique hash values that maintain stability even when faced with polymorphic and metamorphic transformations. Comparative analysis against traditional detection approaches revealed superior performance in identifying novel threats, reducing false-positive rates, and achieving consistent classification across diverse ransomware families. The incorporation of a self-regulating hash convergence mechanism further ensured that entropy-synchronized hashes remained invariant across executions, minimizing classification inconsistencies that often arise due to dynamic modifications in ransomware payloads. Experimental results demonstrated high detection rates across contemporary ransomware strains, with the model exhibiting resilience against encryption-based evasion mechanisms, code injection strategies, and reflective loading techniques. Unlike conventional detection mechanisms that rely on static signatures and heuristic analysis, the proposed entropy-aware classification framework adapts to emerging threats through an inherent ability to capture entropy anomalies within executable structures. The findings reinforce the potential of entropy-based detection in addressing the limitations of traditional methodologies while enhancing detection robustness against obfuscation and adversarial evasion techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

However, current SAEs fall short of completely explaining model performance, resulting in "dark matter": unexplained variance in activations. This work investigates dark matter as an object of study in its own right. Surprisingly, we find that much of SAE dark matter -- about half of the error vector itself and >90% of its norm -- can be linearly predicted from the initial activation vector. Additionally, we find that the scaling behavior of SAE error norms at a per token level is remarkably predictable: larger SAEs mostly struggle to reconstruct the same contexts as smaller SAEs. We build on the linear representation hypothesis to propose models of activations that might lead to these observations. These insights imply that the part of the SAE error vector that cannot be linearly predicted ("nonlinear" error) might be fundamentally different from the linearly predictable component. To validate this hypothesis, we empirically analyze nonlinear SAE error and show that 1) it contains fewer not yet learned features, 2) SAEs trained on it are quantitatively worse, and 3) it is responsible for a proportional amount of the downstream increase in cross entropy loss when SAE activations are inserted into the model. Finally, we examine two methods to reduce nonlinear SAE error: inference time gradient pursuit, which leads to a very slight decrease in nonlinear error, and linear transformations from earlier layer SAE outputs, which leads to a larger reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR.

However, inferring the placement of latent nodes in a tree is computationally expensive. State-of-the-art methods rely on carefully designed heuristics for tree search, using different data structures for easy manipulation (e.g., classes in object-oriented programming languages) and readable representation of trees (e.g., Newick-format strings). Here, we present Phylo2Vec, a parsimonious encoding for phylogenetic trees that serves as a unified approach for both manipulating and representing phylogenetic trees. Phylo2Vec maps any binary tree with $n$ leaves to a unique integer vector of length $n-1$. The advantages of Phylo2Vec are fourfold: i) fast tree sampling, (ii) compressed tree representation compared to a Newick string, iii) quick and unambiguous verification if two binary trees are identical topologically, and iv) systematic ability to traverse tree space in very large or small jumps. As a proof of concept, we use Phylo2Vec for maximum likelihood inference on five real-world datasets and show that a simple hill-climbing-based optimisation scheme can efficiently traverse the vastness of tree space from a random to an optimal tree.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Nordic perspective on System Integrity Protection Schemes in relation to capacity allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19827v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The urgent need to address climate change prompts societies worldwide to adopt carbon neutral energy and electrification. To facilitate this, a range of technologies and policies will be needed. Alternatives to traditional power grid reinforcement, such as grid-enhancing technologies and system automation, are particularly attractive due to their potentially low cost and fast deployment time. One alternative is System Integrity Protection Schemes (SIPS) - automatic and curative remedial actions (RAs) which can boost grid transfer capacities without compromising with reliability since they can act faster than manual control. The use of SIPS however is scattered, with limited coordination between countries, and the full potential of using SIPS for capacity enhancement is not yet realized. The aim of this paper is to provide a case study and comparison of SIPS in the Nordic countries, particularly in relation to capacity allocation. It also seeks to harmonize terminology relating to ancillary services, RAs, and SIPS. Finally, it examines and compares the inclusion of RAs and SIPS in different Capacity Calculation Methodologies (CCMs). In both main EU CCMs - Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) and Flow-Based (FB) - RAs play a pronounced role. The paper is based on a survey and interviews with Nordic stakeholders, along with a literature review and analysis of public data. The results indicate a large variation in SIPS use across the Nordics. Regarding terminology, we suggest that SIPS is a subcategory of RAs which overlaps with ancillary services. Concerning CCMs, NTC is unable to fully represent capacity constraints in meshed AC systems, which in turn hinders systematic capacity enhancement using RAs. FB on the other hand explicitly includes RAs in the capacity domain. A lower bound for the economic value of RAs can be calculated, amounting to 11.5 million EUR in the Nordics in Nov and Dec 2024.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CIGRE Symposium 2025 in Trondheim, 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[FREE-Merging: Fourier Transform for Efficient Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16815v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of deep learning, there is an increasing availability of open-source models for various tasks. However, single fine-tuned models often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. Model merging has thus emerged as an efficient method to integrate the capabilities of existing models into a unified model. Nevertheless, existing model merging methods face challenging trade-offs between performance and deployment costs, primarily due to task interference. For the first time, we reveal that task interference is evident in the frequency domain of model parameters, yet current efforts only focus on spatial domain solutions, which are largely ineffective in addressing frequency domain interference. To mitigate the impact of frequency domain interference, we propose FR-Merging, an innovative method that effectively filters harmful frequency domain interference on the backbone with minimal computational overhead. Since performance loss is inevitable with cost-free methods, we propose a lightweight task-specific expert module that dynamically compensates for information loss during merging. This proposed framework, FREE-Merging (FR-Merging with experts), strikes a balanced trade-off between training cost, inference latency, storage requirements, and performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both FR-Merging and FREE-Merging on multiple tasks across CV, NLP, and Multi-Modal domains and show that they can be flexibly adapted to specific needs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

We present GCC, which leverages diffusion models to inpaint color checkers into images for illumination estimation. Our key innovations include (1) a single-step deterministic inference approach that inpaints color checkers reflecting scene illumination, (2) a Laplacian decomposition technique that preserves checker structure while allowing illumination-dependent color adaptation, and (3) a mask-based data augmentation strategy for handling imprecise color checker annotations. By harnessing rich priors from pre-trained diffusion models, GCC demonstrates strong robustness in challenging cross-camera scenarios. These results highlight our method's effective generalization capability across different camera characteristics without requiring sensor-specific training, making it a versatile and practical solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to CVPR 2025.

Existing methods, such as FreeNeRF and SparseNeRF, use frequency regularization or pre-trained priors but struggle with complex scheduling and bias. We introduce FrugalNeRF, a novel few-shot NeRF framework that leverages weight-sharing voxels across multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details. Our key contribution is a cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme that selects pseudo ground truth depth based on reprojection errors across scales. This guides training without relying on externally learned priors, enabling full utilization of the training data. It can also integrate pre-trained priors, enhancing quality without slowing convergence. Experiments on LLFF, DTU, and RealEstate-10K show that FrugalNeRF outperforms other few-shot NeRF methods while significantly reducing training time, making it a practical solution for efficient and accurate 3D scene reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to CVPR 2025.

The effectiveness of PBT depends critically on the speed of these generators. However, careful measurements show that the generator performance of widely used PBT libraries falls well short of what is possible, due principally to (1) the abstraction overhead of their combinator-heavy style and (2) suboptimal sources of randomness. We characterize, quantify, and address these bottlenecks. To eliminate abstraction overheads, we propose a technique based on multi-stage programming, dubbed Allegro. We apply this technique to leading generator libraries in OCaml and Scala 3, significantly improving performance. To quantify the performance impact of the randomness source, we carry out a controlled experiment, replacing the randomness in the OCaml PBT library with an optimized version. Both interventions exactly preserve the semantics of generators, enabling precise, pointwise comparisons. Together, these improvements find bugs up to $13\times$ faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures, under review at OOPSLA</p></details> |

The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness properties of common model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We derive nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings and illustrate practical relevance of fast and systematic control switching.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Objective Bayes, (generalized) fiducial inference, etc. fall under this umbrella. This construction is natural, but the corresponding posterior distributions generally only offer limited, approximately valid uncertainty quantification. The present paper takes a reimagined approach offering posterior distributions with stronger reliability properties. The proposed construction starts with an inferential model (IM), one that takes the mathematical form of a data-driven possibility measure and features exactly valid uncertainty quantification, and then returns a so-called inner probabilistic approximation thereof. This inner probabilistic approximation inherits many of the original IM's desirable properties, including credible sets with exact coverage and asymptotic efficiency. The approximation also agrees with the familiar Bayes/fiducial solution obtained in applications where the model has a group transformation structure. A Monte Carlo method for evaluating the probabilistic approximation is presented, along with numerical illustrations.</p></details> | 16 pages + appendix |
| **[PCM : Picard Consistency Model for Fast Parallel Sampling of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19731v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have achieved significant advances in vision, text, and robotics. However, they still face slow generation speeds due to sequential denoising processes. To address this, a parallel sampling method based on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps while ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard iteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow generation in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme, the Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of generation steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is directly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at any stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new concept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures exact convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCM achieves up to a 2.71x speedup over sequential sampling and a 1.77x speedup over Picard iteration across various tasks, including image generation and robotic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Communities in the Kuramoto Model: Dynamics and Detection via Path Signatures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17546v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The behavior of multivariate dynamical processes is often governed by underlying structural connections that relate the components of the system. For example, brain activity which is often measured via time series is determined by an underlying structural graph, where nodes represent neurons or brain regions and edges represent cortical connectivity. Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto stochastic block model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. Our results demonstrate that path signatures provide a novel perspective on analyzing complex neural data and other high-dimensional systems, explicitly exploiting temporal functional relationships to infer underlying structure.</p></details> | 46 pages, 13 figures |

To enhance user experience, recent studies investigate VLM personalization to understand user-provided concepts. However, they mainly focus on single-concept personalization, neglecting the existence and interplay of multiple concepts, which limits real-world applicability. This paper proposes the first multi-concept personalization paradigm, MC-LLaVA. Specifically, MC-LLaVA employs a multi-concept instruction tuning strategy, effectively integrating multiple concepts in a single training step. To reduce the costs related to joint training, we propose a personalized textual prompt that uses visual token information to initialize concept tokens. Additionally, we introduce a personalized visual prompt during inference, aggregating location confidence maps for enhanced recognition and grounding capabilities. To advance multi-concept personalization research, we further contribute a high-quality instruction tuning dataset. We carefully collect images with multiple characters and objects from movies and manually generate question-answer samples for multi-concept scenarios, featuring superior diversity. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MC-LLaVA can achieve impressive multi-concept personalized responses, paving the way for VLMs to become better user-specific assistants. The code and dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/arctanxarc/MC-LLaVA}.</p></details> | <details><summary>I sin...</summary><p>I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

A hierarchical alignment method was introduced to restructure token embeddings without altering core model weights, ensuring that representational distributions maintained coherence across different linguistic contexts. Experimental evaluations demonstrated improvements in rare token retrieval, adversarial robustness, and long-range dependency tracking, highlighting the advantages of hierarchical structuring in mitigating inconsistencies in latent space organization. The comparative analysis against conventional fine-tuning and embedding perturbation methods revealed that hierarchical restructuring maintained computational efficiency while achieving measurable gains in representation quality. Structural refinements introduced through the alignment process resulted in improved contextual stability across varied linguistic tasks, reducing inconsistencies in token proximity relationships and enhancing interpretability in language generation. A detailed computational assessment confirmed that the realignment process introduced minimal inference overhead, ensuring that representational improvements did not compromise model efficiency.

Conventional methods for token management often impose fixed retention thresholds or rely on uniform attention weight distributions, leading to inefficient memory utilization and premature information loss in extended sequence modeling. Structured Token Retention (STR) introduces a probabilistic selection framework that dynamically adjusts token persistence based on contextual significance, ensuring that computational resources are allocated to semantically relevant elements. Computational Memory Paths (CMP) extend this framework through hierarchical memory allocation, refining retention efficiency through structured reallocation of token embeddings. Comparative assessments against baseline models demonstrate that STR and CMP improve token survival rates across long input sequences while reducing cumulative error propagation across processing layers. Experimental results further indicate reductions in computational overhead, improving inference speed without degrading contextual coherence. Token distribution analyses reveal that structured memory allocation prevents excessive redundancy in attention weight calculations, optimizing information retrieval efficiency in large-scale generative architectures. The integration of STR and CMP into an open-source model illustrates the adaptability of structured memory retention methodologies, highlighting their applicability in generative text processing, long-context comprehension, and scalable sequence modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Probabilistic Latent Encryption Mapping presents an alternative detection framework that models ransomware-induced encryption behaviors through statistical representations of entropy deviations and probabilistic dependencies in execution traces. Unlike conventional approaches that depend on explicit bytecode analysis or predefined cryptographic function call monitoring, probabilistic inference techniques classify encryption anomalies based on their underlying statistical characteristics, ensuring greater adaptability to polymorphic attack strategies. Evaluations demonstrate that entropy-driven classification reduces false positive rates while maintaining high detection accuracy across diverse ransomware families and encryption methodologies. Experimental results further highlight the framework's ability to differentiate between benign encryption workflows and adversarial cryptographic manipulations, ensuring that classification performance remains effective across cloud-based and localized execution environments. Benchmark comparisons illustrate that probabilistic modeling exhibits advantages over heuristic and machine learning-based detection approaches, particularly in handling previously unseen encryption techniques and adversarial obfuscation strategies. Computational efficiency analysis confirms that detection latency remains within operational feasibility constraints, reinforcing the viability of probabilistic encryption classification for real-time security infrastructures. The ability to systematically infer encryption-induced deviations without requiring static attack signatures strengthens detection robustness against adversarial evasion techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

The study has introduced a structured latency perturbation mechanism that modifies computational pathways through recursive state induction, enabling dynamic suppression of redundant activations while preserving generative fidelity. A formal mathematical framework has been established to describe recursive perturbations, ensuring that modifications remain adaptive rather than statically imposed. Experiments have demonstrated that applying recursive state adjustments reduces inference latency across varying sequence lengths, with longer text generations benefiting from cumulative efficiency improvements. Comparative evaluations against structured pruning and quantization have indicated that latency gains can be achieved without compromising token retention or memory utilization. The analysis of computational overhead has suggested that selectively suppressing redundant activations contributes to improved power efficiency, particularly in scenarios requiring extended text generation. An assessment of linguistic stability has shown that token-level consistency remains largely intact under controlled perturbation thresholds, reinforcing the viability of structural latency modifications as an alternative to weight-centric optimization techniques. The results have supported the hypothesis that recursive state induction offers an effective method for reducing computational complexity without requiring architectural modifications or external augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Conventional attention mechanisms, while effective in many applications, exhibit limitations in maintaining coherent contextual representations over extended sequences due to their reliance on discrete token interactions. A novel approach is introduced through the formulation of Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation (ITFP), which models contextual relationships as continuous tensor fields distributed across token embeddings. The propagation dynamics are governed through differential equations that enable a structured flow of contextual information, augmenting the standard attention mechanism to enhance coherence and recall. A series of experiments conducted on an open-source transformer-based model demonstrate that ITFP provides measurable improvements in contextual retention, dependency resolution, and inference stability across various linguistic structures. Comparisons with baseline models reveal a reduction in syntactic inconsistencies and factual errors, while ablation studies indicate that the choice of propagation depth and integration strength significantly impacts model performance. Additional evaluations assessing domain generalization suggest that ITFP effectively adapts across different text genres, reinforcing its applicability beyond conventional language modeling tasks. Although computational trade-offs are introduced through the inclusion of tensor field computations, empirical findings suggest that the benefits in accuracy and coherence outweigh the increased processing demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Conceptual redundancies embedded across layers often result in inefficiencies that affect both computational demands and task-specific outcomes. A framework was proposed to restructure these redundancies through advanced clustering techniques and dynamic thresholding, ensuring that critical semantic relationships are preserved while removing unnecessary overlaps. Evaluations revealed improved memory efficiency and faster inference times, alongside better alignment in latent knowledge clusters that enhanced interpretability. Improvements in error rates and adversarial robustness suggest that restructuring redundancies has broader implications for increasing model reliability across diverse applications. Comparative analyses highlighted reductions in resource consumption and notable gains in performance, particularly in translation and summarization tasks. Energy metrics demonstrated significant savings during training phases, further validating the practicality of the approach for real-world deployments. Representational fidelity was also enhanced, with latent space evaluations indicating better cluster alignment and higher semantic consistency.

Contextual Subspace Manifold Projection introduces a structured refinement technique that selectively reconfigures token embeddings through controlled subspace constraints, ensuring more stable and geometrically well-defined feature distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the structured intervention reduced anisotropy, leading to improved representation compactness while preserving semantic fidelity across transformer layers. Clustering analyses indicated that token embeddings exhibited greater feature separability, reinforcing the hypothesis that structured projection techniques enhance internal representation organization without sacrificing linguistic coherence. Gradient magnitude distributions suggested that the method introduced a smoother optimization trajectory, potentially contributing to more stable parameter updates throughout training. Computational overhead associated with the projection operations remained minimal, ensuring that the refinements did not introduce significant trade-offs in model efficiency or inference speed. Comparisons with standard embedding refinement techniques highlighted that structured manifold constraints provided a direct mechanism for improving representation quality without requiring additional gradient-based optimization.

Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

When we say that Olivia and Noah excel in mathematics, we disregard the specific differences in their mathematical abilities. Similarly, when we claim that a particular automobile manufacturer produces high-quality cars, we overlook the minor variations among individual vehicles. These coarse-grained assessments are distinct from erroneous or deceptive judgments, such as those resulting from student cheating or false advertising by corporations. Despite the prevalence of such judgments, little attention has been given to their underlying mathematical structure. In this paper, we introduce the concept of coarse-graining into game theory, analyzing games where players may perceive different payoffs as identical while preserving the underlying order structure. We call it a Coarse-Grained Game (CGG). This framework allows us to examine the rational inference processes that arise when players equate distinct micro-level payoffs at a macro level, and to explore how Nash equilibria are preserved or altered as a result. Our key findings suggest that CGGs possess several desirable properties that make them suitable for modeling phenomena in the social sciences. This paper demonstrates two such applications: first, in cases of overly minor product updates, consumers may encounter an equilibrium selection problem, resulting in market behavior that is not driven by objective quality differences; second, the lemon market can be analyzed not only through objective information asymmetry but also through asymmetries in perceptual resolution or recognition ability.</p></details> | 49 pages |
| **[SACB-Net: Spatial-awareness Convolutions for Medical Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19592v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based image registration methods have shown state-of-the-art performance and rapid inference speeds. Despite these advances, many existing approaches fall short in capturing spatially varying information in non-local regions of feature maps due to the reliance on spatially-shared convolution kernels. This limitation leads to suboptimal estimation of deformation fields. In this paper, we propose a 3D Spatial-Awareness Convolution Block (SACB) to enhance the spatial information within feature representations. Our SACB estimates the spatial clusters within feature maps by leveraging feature similarity and subsequently parameterizes the adaptive convolution kernels across diverse regions. This adaptive mechanism generates the convolution kernels (weights and biases) tailored to spatial variations, thereby enabling the network to effectively capture spatially varying information. Building on SACB, we introduce a pyramid flow estimator (named SACB-Net) that integrates SACBs to facilitate multi-scale flow composition, particularly addressing large deformations. Experimental results on the brain IXI and LPBA datasets as well as Abdomen CT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SACB and the superiority of SACB-Net over the state-of-the-art learning-based registration methods. The code is available at https://github.com/x-xc/SACB_Net .</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Modern production lines, specializing in robotics, require higher flexibility and mobility, which drives the integration of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and 5G networks in Industry 4.0. TSN achieves deterministic communications by using mechanisms such as the IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), which schedules packet transmissions within precise cycles, thereby reducing latency, jitter, and congestion. 5G networks complement TSN by providing wireless mobility and supporting ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications. However, 5G channel effects such as fast fading, interference, and network-induced latency and jitter can disrupt TSN traffic, potentially compromising deterministic scheduling and performance. This paper presents an empirical analysis of 5G network latency and jitter on IEEE 802.1Qbv performance in a 5G-TSN network. We evaluate the impact of 5G integration on TSN's deterministic scheduling through a testbed combining IEEE 802.1Qbv-enabled switches, TSN translators, and a commercial 5G system. Our results show that, with proper TAS configuration in the TSN switch aligned with the 5G system, jitter can be mitigated, maintaining deterministic performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>21st ...</summary><p>21st IEEE International Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS 2025) (8 pages)</p></details> |

We explain that both exact Bayesian inference and the loss functions typical of variational inference (such as variational free energy and its generalizations) satisfy chain rules akin to that of reverse-mode automatic differentiation, and we advocate for exploiting this to build and optimize models accordingly. To this end, we construct a series of compositional tools: for building models; for constructing their inversions; for attaching local loss functions; and for exposing parameters. Finally, we explain how the resulting parameterized statistical games may be optimized locally, too. We illustrate our framework with a number of classic examples, pointing to new areas of extensibility that are revealed.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages. v2: fixed a typo</p></details> |

Existing methods are designed for specific ball types and struggle to generalize. This challenge arises from three key factors. First, learning-based models require large datasets but suffer from accuracy drops in unseen scenarios. Second, physics-based models rely on complex formulas and detailed inputs, yet accurately obtaining ball states, such as spin, is often impractical. Third, integrating physical principles with neural networks to achieve high accuracy, fast inference, and strong generalization remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose an innovative approach that incorporates physics-based equations and neural networks. We first derive three generalized physical formulas. Then, using a neural network and observed trajectory points, we infer certain parameters while fitting the remaining ones. These formulas enable precise trajectory prediction with minimal training data: only a few dozen samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method superiority in generalization, real-time performance, and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission was made without my advisor's consent, and I mistakenly uploaded an incorrect version of the paper.

| **[Bootstrapping Estimators based on the Block Maxima Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05529v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The block maxima method is a standard approach for analyzing the extremal behavior of a potentially multivariate time series. It has recently been found that the classical approach based on disjoint block maxima may be universally improved by considering sliding block maxima instead. However, the asymptotic variance formula for estimators based on sliding block maxima involves an integral over the covariance of a certain family of multivariate extreme value distributions, which makes its estimation, and inference in general, an intricate problem. As an alternative, one may rely on bootstrap approximations: we show that naive block-bootstrap approaches from time series analysis are inconsistent even in i.i.d.\ situations, and provide a consistent alternative based on resampling circular block maxima. As a by-product, we show consistency of the classical resampling bootstrap for disjoint block maxima, and that estimators based on circular block maxima have the same asymptotic variance as their sliding block maxima counterparts. The finite sample properties are illustrated by Monte Carlo experiments, and the methods are demonstrated by a case study of precipitation extremes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main article: 27 pages, supplement: 30 pages, 24 figures</p></details> |
| **[T-MAC: CPU Renaissance via Table Lookup for Low-Bit LLM Deployment on Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00088v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly important to enhance on-device intelligence. Weight quantization is crucial for reducing the memory footprint of LLMs on devices. However, low-bit LLMs necessitate mixed precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) of low precision weights and high precision activations during inference. Existing systems, lacking native support for mpGEMM, resort to dequantize weights for high precision computation. Such an indirect way can lead to a significant inference overhead. In this paper, we introduce T-MAC, an innovative lookup table(LUT)-based method designed for efficient low-bit LLM (i.e., weight-quantized LLM) inference on CPUs. T-MAC directly supports mpGEMM without dequantization, while simultaneously eliminating multiplications and reducing additions required. Specifically, T-MAC transforms the traditional data-type-centric multiplication to bit-wise table lookup, and enables a unified and scalable mpGEMM solution. Our LUT-based kernels scale linearly to the weight bit-width. Evaluated on low-bit Llama and BitNet models, T-MAC demonstrates up to 4x increase in throughput and 70% reduction in energy consumption compared to llama.cpp. For BitNet-b1.58-3B, T-MAC delivers a token generation throughput of 30 tokens/s with a single core and 71 tokens/s with eight cores on M2-Ultra, and 11 tokens/s on lower-end devices like Raspberry Pi 5, which significantly exceeds the adult average reading speed. T-MAC with LUT-based computing paradigm, paves the way for the practical deployment of low-bit LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices without compromising computational efficiency.

However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aejion.github.io/accvideo/</p></details> |

But it remains challenging to generalize to unseen object categories and diverse task instructions. In this paper, we propose G-DexGrasp, a retrieval-augmented generation approach that can produce high-quality dexterous hand configurations for unseen object categories and language-based task instructions. The key is to retrieve generalizable grasping priors, including the fine-grained contact part and the affordance-related distribution of relevant grasping instances, for the following synthesis pipeline. Specifically, the fine-grained contact part and affordance act as generalizable guidance to infer reasonable grasping configurations for unseen objects with a generative model, while the relevant grasping distribution plays as regularization to guarantee the plausibility of synthesized grasps during the subsequent refinement optimization. Our comparison experiments validate the effectiveness of our key designs for generalization and demonstrate the remarkable performance against the existing approaches.

| **[Data-centric Federated Graph Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19455v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In federated graph learning (FGL), a complete graph is divided into multiple subgraphs stored in each client due to privacy concerns, and all clients jointly train a global graph model by only transmitting model parameters. A pain point of FGL is the heterogeneity problem, where nodes or structures present non-IID properties among clients (e.g., different node label distributions), dramatically undermining the convergence and performance of FGL. To address this, existing efforts focus on design strategies at the model level, i.e., they design models to extract common knowledge to mitigate heterogeneity. However, these model-level strategies fail to fundamentally address the heterogeneity problem as the model needs to be designed from scratch when transferring to other tasks. Motivated by large language models (LLMs) having achieved remarkable success, we aim to utilize LLMs to fully understand and augment local text-attributed graphs, to address data heterogeneity at the data level. In this paper, we propose a general framework LLM4FGL that innovatively decomposes the task of LLM for FGL into two sub-tasks theoretically. Specifically, for each client, it first utilizes the LLM to generate missing neighbors and then infers connections between generated nodes and raw nodes. To improve the quality of generated nodes, we design a novel federated generation-and-reflection mechanism for LLMs, without the need to modify the parameters of the LLM but relying solely on the collective feedback from all clients. After neighbor generation, all the clients utilize a pre-trained edge predictor to infer the missing edges. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly integrate as a plug-in with existing FGL methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to advanced baselines.</p></details> | ongoing work |

In immersive scenes, people naturally scan their environment to grasp its overall structure while examining fine details of objects that capture their attention. However, current NeRF frameworks primarily focus on modeling either high-frequency local views or the broad structure of scenes with low-frequency information, which is limited to balancing both. We introduce FA-NeRF, a novel frequency-aware framework for view synthesis that simultaneously captures the overall scene structure and high-definition details within a single NeRF model. To achieve this, we propose a 3D frequency quantification method that analyzes the scene's frequency distribution, enabling frequency-aware rendering. Our framework incorporates a frequency grid for fast convergence and querying, a frequency-aware feature re-weighting strategy to balance features across different frequency contents. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in modeling entire scenes while preserving fine details.

Despite human hand synthesis already being an intricate problem, generating objects in contact with hands and their interactions presents an even more challenging task, especially when the objects exhibit obvious variations in size and shape. To tackle these issues, we present a novel video Reenactment framework focusing on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) via an adaptive Layout-instructed Diffusion model (Re-HOLD). Our key insight is to employ specialized layout representation for hands and objects, respectively. Such representations enable effective disentanglement of hand modeling and object adaptation to diverse motion sequences. To further improve the generation quality of HOI, we design an interactive textural enhancement module for both hands and objects by introducing two independent memory banks. We also propose a layout adjustment strategy for the cross-object reenactment scenario to adaptively adjust unreasonable layouts caused by diverse object sizes during inference. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods.

We consider the problem of developing an effective and efficient fuzzer for the recently ratified QUIC network protocol to uncover security vulnerabilities. QUIC offers a unified transport layer for low latency, reliable transport streams that is inherently secure, ultimately representing a complex protocol design characterised by new features and capabilities for the Internet. Fuzzing a secure transport layer protocol is not trivial. The interactive, strict, rule-based, asynchronous nature of communications with a target, the stateful nature of interactions, security mechanisms to protect communications (such as integrity checks and encryption), and inherent overheads (such as target initialisation) challenge generic network protocol fuzzers. We discuss and address the challenges pertinent to fuzzing transport layer protocols (like QUIC), developing mechanisms that enable fast, effective fuzz testing of QUIC implementations to build a prototype grey-box mutation-based fuzzer; QUIC-Fuzz. We test 6, well-maintained server-side implementations, including from Google and Alibaba with QUIC-Fuzz. The results demonstrate the fuzzer is both highly effective and generalisable. Our testing uncovered 10 new security vulnerabilities, precipitating 2 CVE assignments thus far. In code coverage, QUIC-Fuzz outperforms other existing state-of-the-art network protocol fuzzers (Fuzztruction-Net, ChatAFL, and ALFNet) with up to an 84% increase in code coverage where QUIC-Fuzz outperformed statistically significantly across all targets and with a majority of bugs only discoverable by QUIC-Fuzz.

Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

Instead of calculating a single radiance field, we propose a multi-space neural radiance field (MS-NeRF) that represents the scene using a group of feature fields in parallel sub-spaces, which leads to a better understanding of the neural network toward the existence of reflective and refractive objects. Our multi-space scheme works as an enhancement to existing NeRF methods, with only small computational overheads needed for training and inferring the extra-space outputs. We design different multi-space modules for representative MLP-based and grid-based NeRF methods, which improve Mip-NeRF 360 by 4.15 dB in PSNR with 0.5% extra parameters and further improve TensoRF by 2.71 dB with 0.046% extra parameters on reflective regions without degrading the rendering quality on other regions. We further construct a novel dataset consisting of 33 synthetic scenes and 7 real captured scenes with complex reflection and refraction, where we design complex camera paths to fully benchmark the robustness of NeRF-based methods. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the existing single-space NeRF methods for rendering high-quality scenes concerned with complex light paths through mirror-like objects.

In this regard, we present DeClotH, which separately reconstructs 3D cloth and human body from a single image. This task remains largely unexplored due to the extreme occlusion between cloth and the human body, making it challenging to infer accurate geometries and textures. Moreover, while recent 3D human reconstruction methods have achieved impressive results using text-to-image diffusion models, directly applying such an approach to this problem often leads to incorrect guidance, particularly in reconstructing 3D cloth. To address these challenges, we propose two core designs in our framework. First, to alleviate the occlusion issue, we leverage 3D template models of cloth and human body as regularizations, which provide strong geometric priors to prevent erroneous reconstruction by the occlusion. Second, we introduce a cloth diffusion model specifically designed to provide contextual information about cloth appearance, thereby enhancing the reconstruction of 3D cloth. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach is highly effective in reconstructing both 3D cloth and the human body.

While deep learning has made significant advances, current approaches struggle to generalize as they require task-specific training or fine-tuning on unseen classes. We present Iris, a novel In-context Reference Image guided Segmentation framework that enables flexible adaptation to novel tasks through the use of reference examples without fine-tuning. At its core, Iris features a lightweight context task encoding module that distills task-specific information from reference context image-label pairs. This rich context embedding information is used to guide the segmentation of target objects. By decoupling task encoding from inference, Iris supports diverse strategies from one-shot inference and context example ensemble to object-level context example retrieval and in-context tuning. Through comprehensive evaluation across twelve datasets, we demonstrate that Iris performs strongly compared to task-specific models on in-distribution tasks. On seven held-out datasets, Iris shows superior generalization to out-of-distribution data and unseen classes. Further, Iris's task encoding module can automatically discover anatomical relationships across datasets and modalities, offering insights into medical objects without explicit anatomical supervision.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

While approaches such as Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) provide a principled approach to capturing uncertainty through Bayesian inference, they can be computationally expensive for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (E-PINNs), a framework that leverages a small network, the \emph{epinet}, to efficiently quantify uncertainty in PINNs. The proposed approach works as an add-on to existing, pre-trained PINNs with a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various test cases and compare the results with B-PINNs using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) posterior estimation and dropout-equipped PINNs (Dropout-PINNs). Our experiments show that E-PINNs provide similar coverage to B-PINNs, with often comparable sharpness, while being computationally more efficient. This observation, combined with E-PINNs' more consistent uncertainty estimates and better calibration compared to Dropout-PINNs for the examples presented, indicates that E-PINNs offer a promising approach in terms of accuracy-efficiency trade-off.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[IDOL: Instant Photorealistic 3D Human Creation from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14963v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating a high-fidelity, animatable 3D full-body avatar from a single image is a challenging task due to the diverse appearance and poses of humans and the limited availability of high-quality training data. To achieve fast and high-quality human reconstruction, this work rethinks the task from the perspectives of dataset, model, and representation. First, we introduce a large-scale HUman-centric GEnerated dataset, HuGe100K, consisting of 100K diverse, photorealistic sets of human images. Each set contains 24-view frames in specific human poses, generated using a pose-controllable image-to-multi-view model. Next, leveraging the diversity in views, poses, and appearances within HuGe100K, we develop a scalable feed-forward transformer model to predict a 3D human Gaussian representation in a uniform space from a given human image. This model is trained to disentangle human pose, body shape, clothing geometry, and texture. The estimated Gaussians can be animated without post-processing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and method. Our model demonstrates the ability to efficiently reconstruct photorealistic humans at 1K resolution from a single input image using a single GPU instantly. Additionally, it seamlessly supports various applications, as well as shape and texture editing tasks.

| **[The Surprising Effectiveness of Test-Time Training for Few-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07279v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) have shown impressive performance on tasks within their training distribution, but often struggle with structurally novel tasks even when given a small number of in-context task examples. We investigate the effectiveness of test-time training (TTT) -- temporarily updating model parameters during inference using a loss derived from input data -- as a mechanism for improving LMs' reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), performing TTT with in-context examples yields up to $6\times$ higher accuracy compared to fine-tuned baselines -- reaching $53.0\%$ on the public validation set with an 8B-parameter LM and $61.9\%$ when ensembled with program-synthesis methods, matching average human performance. On BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), TTT on in-context examples surpasses standard few-shot prompting in the $10$-shot setting by $7.3$ percentage points ($50.5\%$ to $57.8\%$). Our findings highlight the limitations of in-context learning for novel tasks and demonstrate the potential of test-time training to enhance language model adaptability.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Efficient Adversarial Detection Frameworks for Vehicle-to-Microgrid Services in Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19318v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into microgrid control systems, the risk of malicious actors exploiting vulnerabilities in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to disrupt power generation and distribution grows. Detection models to identify adversarial attacks need to meet the constraints of edge environments, where computational power and memory are often limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy that optimizes detection models for Vehicle-to-Microgrid (V2M) edge environments without compromising performance against inference and evasion attacks. Our approach integrates model design and compression into a unified process and results in a highly compact detection model that maintains high accuracy. We evaluated our method against four benchmark evasion attacks-Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Basic Iterative Method (BIM), Carlini & Wagner method (C&W) and Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) method-and two knowledge-based attacks, white-box and gray-box. Our optimized model reduces memory usage from 20MB to 1.3MB, inference time from 3.2 seconds to 0.9 seconds, and GPU utilization from 5% to 2.68%.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to 2025 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) Workshops</p></details> |

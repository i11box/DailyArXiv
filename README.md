| **[PhysMaster: Mastering Physical Representation for Video Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13809v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sihuiji.github.io/PhysMaster-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Quantization Meets dLLMs: A Systematic Study of Post-training Quantization for Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14896v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment.

| **[Reasoning in Space via Grounding in the World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13800v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them. Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation, GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely without external modules while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BRIEF-Pro: Universal Context Compression with Short-to-Long Synthesis for Fast and Accurate Multi-Hop Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13799v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck, especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts (fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large, and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x, while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/JasonForJoy/BRIEF</p></details> |
| **[h1: Bootstrapping LLMs to Reason over Longer Horizons via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07312v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. It also transfers significantly to diverse out-of-distribution ReasoningGym domains and long-context benchmarks, indicating broader generalization. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 31 pages, 8 figures, long-horizon reasoning</p></details> |
| **[Learning Inter-Atomic Potentials without Explicit Equivariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00027v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 tables, 10 figures.

| **[Bee: A High-Quality Corpus and Full-Stack Suite to Unlock Advanced Fully Open MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13795v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>homep...</summary><p>homepage: https://open-bee.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[NoisePrints: Distortion-Free Watermarks for Authorship in Private Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13793v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation, proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access to model weights.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code available at: https://github.com/nirgoren/NoisePrints</p></details> |
| **[Flattening Hierarchies with Policy Bootstrapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14975v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a promising approach for pretraining generalist policies on large datasets of reward-free trajectories, akin to the self-supervised objectives used to train foundation models for computer vision and natural language processing. However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation. Across a comprehensive suite of state- and pixel-based locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses state-of-the-art offline GCRL algorithms and scales to complex, long-horizon tasks where prior approaches fail.

| **[The Art of Scaling Reinforcement Learning Compute for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13786v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.</p></details> | 28 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09951v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here, we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs. We implement a minimal sequence generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and memory architecture. In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 21 figures.

| **[Macro-Level Correlational Analysis of Mental Disorders: Economy, Education, Society, and Technology Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13780v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper quantifies the age-stratified global burden of four mental disorders in 27 regions from 1990 to 2021 using GBD 2021. To put it in detail, it links the age-standardized years of disability adjustment with 18 world development indicators across economic, educational, social and information technology sectors. Then, by means of Pearson correlation, mutual information, Granger causality and maximum information coefficient and other methods, the linear, nonlinear and lagged dependency relationships were evaluated. After research, it was found that there is a very prominent spatio-temporal heterogeneity among young people aged 20 to 39, and the coupling relationship is stronger. From the overall situation, education corresponds to a low burden. Unemployment corresponds to a high burden. Through lag analysis, it can be known that the influence time of economic and technological factors is relatively short, while that of educational factors is relatively long. These results highlight the macro determinants that play a role at different time scales and also provide population-level references for verifying computational mental health models and for intervention measures in specific regions and for specific ages.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, ICDM workshop</p></details> |
| **[InternVLA-M1: A Spatially Guided Vision-Language-Action Framework for Generalist Robot Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13778v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

| **[ChA-MAEViT: Unifying Channel-Aware Masked Autoencoders and Multi-Channel Vision Transformers for Improved Cross-Channel Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19331v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch masking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies across different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content using cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation models for fMRI data.

| **[PriorGuide: Test-Time Prior Adaptation for Simulation-Based Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13763v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Amortized simulator-based inference offers a powerful framework for tackling Bayesian inference in computational fields such as engineering or neuroscience, increasingly leveraging modern generative methods like diffusion models to map observed data to model parameters or future predictions. These approaches yield posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring further simulator calls after training on simulated parameter-data pairs. However, their applicability is often limited by the prior distribution(s) used to generate model parameters during this training phase. To overcome this constraint, we introduce PriorGuide, a technique specifically designed for diffusion-based amortized inference methods. PriorGuide leverages a novel guidance approximation that enables flexible adaptation of the trained diffusion model to new priors at test time, crucially without costly retraining. This allows users to readily incorporate updated information or expert knowledge post-training, enhancing the versatility of pre-trained inference models.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles. Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for advancing unified models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from frst three authors.

| **[Confidence-Based Response Abstinence: Improving LLM Trustworthiness via Activation-Based Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13750v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable, architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Uncer...</summary><p>UncertaiNLP at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Asymptotically optimal reinforcement learning in Block Markov Decision Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13748v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces. Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed effectively speed up learning. Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs. This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality.</p></details> | 74 pages, 3 figures |

Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce \textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs.

| **[Inexact subspace projection methods for low-rank tensor eigenvalue problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19578v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose inexact subspace iteration for solving high-dimensional eigenvalue problems with low-rank structure. Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. We compare the proposed methods with an existing inexact Lanczos method with low-rank compression. This method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately in low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, inexact subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We also demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the DMRG method stagnates. Furthermore, the proposed subspace iteration methods do not require a Hermitian matrix, in contrast to Lanczos and DMRG, which are designed specifically for Hermitian matrices.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging, open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor. Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

Designing cognitive architectures and control strategies to drive these agents requires realistic models of human motion. Furthermore, recent research has shown that each person exhibits a unique velocity signature, highlighting how individual motor behaviors are both rich in variability and internally consistent. However, existing models only provide simplified descriptions of human motor behavior, hindering the development of effective cognitive architectures. In this work, we first show that motion amplitude provides a valid and complementary characterization of individual motor signatures. Then, we propose a fully data-driven approach, based on long short-term memory neural networks, to generate original motion that captures the unique features of specific individuals. We validate the architecture using real human data from participants performing spontaneous oscillatory motion. Extensive analyses show that state-of-the-art Kuramoto-like models fail to replicate individual motor signatures, whereas our model accurately reproduces the velocity distribution and amplitude envelopes of the individual it was trained on, while remaining distinct from others.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/FelixMessi/QDLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Work in Progress</p></details> |

To mitigate this bottleneck, especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts (fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large, and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x, while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/JasonForJoy/BRIEF</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space. Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and electrolyte-like species), TransIP effectively learns symmetry in its latent space, providing low equivariance error. Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60% improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly, our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to augmentation-based MLIP models.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 tables, 10 figures.

Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies. Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures. We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks. It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state.

| **[Inexact subspace projection methods for low-rank tensor eigenvalue problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19578v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose inexact subspace iteration for solving high-dimensional eigenvalue problems with low-rank structure. Inexactness stems from low-rank compression, enabling efficient representation of high-dimensional vectors in a low-rank tensor format. A primary challenge in these methods is that standard operations, such as matrix-vector products and linear combinations, increase tensor rank, necessitating rank truncation and hence approximation. We compare the proposed methods with an existing inexact Lanczos method with low-rank compression. This method constructs an approximate orthonormal Krylov basis, which is often difficult to represent accurately in low-rank tensor formats, even when the eigenvectors themselves exhibit low-rank structure. In contrast, inexact subspace iteration uses approximate eigenvectors (Ritz vectors) directly as a subspace basis, bypassing the need for an orthonormal Krylov basis. Our analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that inexact subspace iteration is much more robust to rank-truncation errors compared to the inexact Lanczos method. We also demonstrate that rank-truncated subspace iteration can converge for problems where the DMRG method stagnates. Furthermore, the proposed subspace iteration methods do not require a Hermitian matrix, in contrast to Lanczos and DMRG, which are designed specifically for Hermitian matrices.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models. Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads. We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments. This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2304.10196</p></details> |
| **[NEUROLOGIC: From Neural Representations to Interpretable Logic Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08281v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rule-based explanation methods offer rigorous and globally interpretable insights into neural network behavior. However, existing approaches are mostly limited to small fully connected networks and depend on costly layerwise rule extraction and substitution processes. These limitations hinder their generalization to more complex architectures such as Transformers. Moreover, existing methods produce shallow, decision-tree-like rules that fail to capture rich, high-level abstractions in complex domains like computer vision and natural language processing. To address these challenges, we propose NEUROLOGIC, a novel framework that extracts interpretable logical rules directly from deep neural networks. Unlike previous methods, NEUROLOGIC can construct logic rules over hidden predicates derived from neural representations at any chosen layer, in contrast to costly layerwise extraction and rewriting. This flexibility enables broader architectural compatibility and improved scalability. Furthermore, NEUROLOGIC supports richer logical constructs and can incorporate human prior knowledge to ground hidden predicates back to the input space, enhancing interpretability. We validate NEUROLOGIC on Transformer-based sentiment analysis, demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful, interpretable logic rules and provide deeper insights-tasks where existing methods struggle to scale.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Leveraging Nested MLMC for Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation with Intractable Likelihoods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16776v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in studying sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) techniques due to their advantages for simulation-based models with intractable likelihoods. The methods aim to learn the posterior from adaptively proposed simulations using neural network-based conditional density estimators. As an SNPE technique, the automatic posterior transformation (APT) method proposed by Greenberg et al. (2019) performs well and scales to high-dimensional data. However, the APT method requires computing the expectation of the logarithm of an intractable normalizing constant, i.e., a nested expectation. Although atomic proposals were used to render an analytical normalizing constant, it remains challenging to analyze the convergence of learning. In this paper, we reformulate APT as a nested estimation problem. Building on this, we construct several multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) estimators for the loss function and its gradients to accommodate different scenarios, including two unbiased estimators, and a biased estimator that trades a small bias for reduced variance and controlled runtime and memory usage. We also provide convergence results of stochastic gradient descent to quantify the interaction of the bias and variance of the gradient estimator. Numerical experiments for approximating complex posteriors with multimodality in moderate dimensions are provided to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |

To streamline this process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate, engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity (accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment (timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

By combining the energy method with the coercivity of fractional derivatives, we convert the original partial differential equations into a coupled ordinary differential system. Through Laplace transform and maximum principle arguments, we reveal a dichotomy in decay behavior: When the highest fractional order is less than one, solutions exhibit sublinear decay, whereas systems with the highest order equal to one demonstrate a distinct superlinear decay pattern. This phenomenon fundamentally distinguishes coupled systems from single fractional diffusion equations, where such accelerated superlinear decay never occurs. Numerical experiments employing finite difference methods and implicit discretization schemes validate the theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a legitimate user's information rate while imposing explicit upper bounds on both the information leakage to an eavesdropper and the informational cost of encoding the secret message. By leveraging local geometric approximations, this inherently non-convex problem is transformed into a tractable quadratic programming structure. It is demonstrated that the optimal Lagrange multipliers governing this approximated problem can be found by solving a linear program. The constraints of this linear program are derived from Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and are expressed in terms of the generalized eigenvalues of channel-derived matrices. This framework facilitates the derivation of an analytical formula for an approximate local secrecy capacity. Furthermore, we define and analyze a new class of secret local contraction coefficients. These coefficients, characterized as the largest generalized eigenvalues of a matrix pencil, quantify the maximum achievable ratio of approximate utility to approximate leakage, thus measuring the intrinsic local leakage efficiency of the channel. We establish bounds connecting these local coefficients to their global counterparts defined over true mutual information measures. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through detailed analysis and numerical illustrations for both general multi-mode channels and the canonical binary symmetric wiretap channel.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 12 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains, including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline transformer-based models.

| **[Steer-MoE: Efficient Audio-Language Alignment with a Mixture-of-Experts Steering Module](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13558v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning pretrained audio encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising, parameter-efficient path to building powerful multimodal agents. However, existing methods often require costly full-model finetuning or rely on static adapters that may lack expressive power. Drawing inspiration from the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we introduce SteerMoE, a novel and modular framework for audio-language alignment. SteerMoE freezes both the audio encoder and the LLM decoder, training only a lightweight steering module integrated within the encoder's layers. This module uses a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) router to dynamically select and apply learned steering vectors, progressively transforming continuous audio representations into a space comprehensible to the LLM. By operating entirely in the continuous embedding space, our approach requires no modifications to the LLM's vocabulary and preserves its advanced reasoning and agentic capabilities. We demonstrate through experiments on ASR, audio understanding, and a qualitative function-calling task that SteerMoE achieves strong performance while remaining highly modular and computationally efficient, offering a robust new paradigm for developing sophisticated audio-language systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figures.

This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (10/2025).

Conventional approaches solve for a single stationary point of the ideal MHD equations, which is fully defined by three invariants and the numerical scheme employed by the solver. We present the first numerical approach that can solve for a continuous distribution of equilibria with fixed boundary and rotational transform, varying only the pressure invariant. This approach minimises the force residual by optimising parameters of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) that map from a scalar pressure multiplier to the Fourier Zernike basis as implemented in the modern stellarator equilibrium solver DESC.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Inspired by this organization, we propose Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo): a modular, transformer-based architecture post-trained with a curriculum that induces functional specialization across experts. Concretely, we partition the layers of a pretrained language model into four expert modules aligned with well-studied cognitive networks in the human brain. MiCRo offers three key advantages over standard language models. (1) The specialized experts are interpretable and causally meaningful -- ablating a module causes substantial drops on benchmarks requiring its specialized domain. (2) MiCRo's behavior can be dynamically steered at inference time by routing tokens to particular experts (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over outputs. (3) MiCRo outperforms or matches comparable baselines on both machine-learning reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, BBH) and alignment to human behavior (CogBench), while maintaining interpretability. Taken together, cognitively grounded functional specialization yields models that are both more human-like and more human-interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[CoDS: Enhancing Collaborative Perception in Heterogeneous Scenarios via Domain Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13432v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively. Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios. The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

However, the assumption of complete multimodality rarely holds in practice due to missing images and incomplete descriptions, hindering model robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with \textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i) cross-modal preference invariance, ensuring consistent user preference modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective multimodal representation, as modality information becomes unreliable in such scenarios, reducing the dependence on modality-specific information is particularly important. By treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn preference-oriented representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module is developed to explicitly simulate modality-missing scenarios. Built upon the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, the module aims to preserve essential user preference signals across these scenarios while effectively compressing modality-specific information. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM Multimedia 2025 Accepted</p></details> |

This wave of innovation has revolutionized how we interact with technology, seamlessly integrating LLMs into everyday tasks such as vacation planning, email drafting, and content creation. While English-speaking users have significantly benefited from these advancements, the Arabic world faces distinct challenges in developing Arabic-specific LLMs. Arabic, one of the languages spoken most widely around the world, serves more than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities. The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that ALLMs present for the Arab world.</p></details> | Accepted at CACM |
| **[MelCap: A Unified Single-Codebook Neural Codec for High-Fidelity Audio Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01903v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio codecs have recently emerged as powerful tools for high-quality and low-bitrate audio compression, leveraging deep generative models to learn latent representations of audio signals. However, existing approaches either rely on a single quantizer that only processes speech domain, or on multiple quantizers that are not well suited for downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose MelCap, a unified "one-codebook-for-all" neural codec that effectively handles speech, music, and general sound. By decomposing audio reconstruction into two stages, our method preserves more acoustic details than previous single-codebook approaches, while achieving performance comparable to mainstream multi-codebook methods. In the first stage, audio is transformed into mel-spectrograms, which are compressed and quantized into compact single tokens using a 2D tokenizer. A perceptual loss is further applied to mitigate the over-smoothing artifacts observed in spectrogram reconstruction. In the second stage, a Vocoder recovers waveforms from the mel discrete tokens in a single forward pass, enabling real-time decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that MelCap achieves quality on comparable to state-of-the-art multi-codebook codecs, while retaining the computational simplicity of a single-codebook design, thereby providing an effective representation for downstream tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Generalizing WiFi Gesture Recognition via Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13390v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world AIoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICPADS 2025</p></details> |

In particular, Johnson's Relative Weight (RW) has been deemed the most successful OTM in the literature. Nevertheless, the theoretical foundation of the OTMs remains unclear. To further understand the OTMs, we provide a generalized framework that breaks down the OTM into two functional steps: orthogonalization and reallocation. To assess the impact of each step on the performance of OTMs, we conduct extensive Monte Carlo simulations under various predictors' correlation structures and response variable distributions. Our findings reveal that Johnson's minimal transformation consistently outperforms other common orthogonalization methods. We also summarize the performance of reallocation methods under four scenarios of predictors' correlation structures in terms of the first principal component and the variance inflation factor (VIF). This analysis provides guidelines for selecting appropriate reallocation methods in different scenarios, illustrated with real-world dataset examples. Our research offers a deeper understanding of OTMs and provides valuable insights for practitioners seeking to accurately measure variable importance in various modeling contexts.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[The Implicit Bias of Structured State Space Models Can Be Poisoned With Clean Labels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10473v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are powered by an implicit bias: a tendency of gradient descent to fit training data in a way that generalizes to unseen data. A recent class of neural network models gaining increasing popularity is structured state space models (SSMs), regarded as an efficient alternative to transformers. Prior work argued that the implicit bias of SSMs leads to generalization in a setting where data is generated by a low dimensional teacher. In this paper, we revisit the latter setting, and formally establish a phenomenon entirely undetected by prior work on the implicit bias of SSMs. Namely, we prove that while implicit bias leads to generalization under many choices of training data, there exist special examples whose inclusion in training completely distorts the implicit bias, to a point where generalization fails. This failure occurs despite the special training examples being labeled by the teacher, i.e. having clean labels! We empirically demonstrate the phenomenon, with SSMs trained independently and as part of non-linear neural networks. In the area of adversarial machine learning, disrupting generalization with cleanly labeled training examples is known as clean-label poisoning. Given the proliferation of SSMs, we believe that delineating their susceptibility to clean-label poisoning, and developing methods for overcoming this susceptibility, are critical research directions to pursue.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of the work accepted as a short paper at the 26th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2025).

To mitigate this bottleneck, especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts (fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large, and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x, while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/JasonForJoy/BRIEF</p></details> |

Existing approaches to combat this rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex, multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating. Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer, competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x. It also transfers significantly to diverse out-of-distribution ReasoningGym domains and long-context benchmarks, indicating broader generalization. Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1 therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon problems using only existing data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 31 pages, 8 figures, long-horizon reasoning</p></details> |

These approaches yield posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring further simulator calls after training on simulated parameter-data pairs. However, their applicability is often limited by the prior distribution(s) used to generate model parameters during this training phase. To overcome this constraint, we introduce PriorGuide, a technique specifically designed for diffusion-based amortized inference methods. PriorGuide leverages a novel guidance approximation that enables flexible adaptation of the trained diffusion model to new priors at test time, crucially without costly retraining. This allows users to readily incorporate updated information or expert knowledge post-training, enhancing the versatility of pre-trained inference models.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

Improper segregation and disposal of HCW leads to contamination, spreading of infectious diseases and risk for waste handlers. This study benchmarks the state of the art waste classification models: ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S, YOLOv8-n and YOLOv5-s using stratified 5-fold cross-validation technique on combined HCW data. YOLOv5-s achieved the highest accuracy (95.06%) but fell short with the YOLOv8-n model in inference speed with few milliseconds. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took the highest inference time. Following a repetitive ANOVA test to confirm the statistical significance, the best performing model (YOLOv5-s) was deployed to the web with bin color mapped using Nepal's HCW management standards.

However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/mvcustom</p></details> |

Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Our approach shifts from the conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model, which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://imlixinyang.github.io/FlashWorld-Project-Page/</p></details> |

| **[Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of Dengue in Recife, Brazil (2015-2024): The Role of Spatial Granularity and Data Quality for Epidemiological Risk Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13672v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dengue remains one of Brazil's major epidemiological challenges, marked by strong intra-urban inequalities and the influence of climatic and socio-environmental factors. This study analyzed confirmed dengue cases in Recife from 2015 to 2024 using a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal model implemented in R-INLA, combining a BYM2 spatial structure with an RW1 temporal component. Covariates included population density, household size, income, drainage channels, lagged precipitation, and mean temperature. Population density and household size had positive effects on dengue risk, while income and channel presence were protective. Lagged precipitation increased risk, and higher temperatures showed an inverse association, suggesting thermal thresholds for vector activity. The model achieved good fit (DIC=65817; WAIC=64506) and stable convergence, with moderate residual spatial autocorrelation (phi=0.06) and a smooth temporal trend between 2016 and 2019. Spatio-temporal estimates revealed persistent high-risk clusters in northern and western Recife, overlapping with areas of higher density and social vulnerability. Beyond reproducing historical patterns, the Bayesian model supports probabilistic forecasting and early warning systems. Compared with classical models (GLM, SAR, GWR, GTWR), INLA explicitly integrates uncertainty and spatial-temporal dependence, offering credible interval inference for decision-making in urban health management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[NOSA: Native and Offloadable Sparse Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13602v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general, and feature detection and SLAM in particular. On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal). The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM. However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in 2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Due to anycast's crucial role in the modern Internet, earlier research introduced tools to perform anycast censuses. The first, iGreedy, uses latency measurements from geographically dispersed locations to map anycast deployments. The second, MAnycast2, uses anycast to perform a census of other anycast networks. MAnycast2's advantage is speed and coverage but suffers from problems with accuracy, while iGreedy is highly accurate but slower using author-defined probing rates and costlier. In this paper we address the shortcomings of both systems and present LACeS (Longitudinal Anycast Census System). Taking MAnycast2 as a basis, we completely redesign its measurement pipeline, and add support for distributed probing, additional protocols (DNS over UDP, TCP SYN/ACK, and IPv6) and latency measurements similar to iGreedy. We validate LACeS on an anycast testbed with 32 globally distributed nodes, compare against an external anycast production deployment, extensive latency measurements with RIPE Atlas and cross-check over 60% of detected anycast using operator ground truth that shows LACeS achieves high accuracy. Finally, we provide a longitudinal analysis of anycast, covering 17+ months, showing LACeS achieves high precision. We make continual daily LACeS censuses available to the community and release the source code of the tool under a permissive open source license.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages + 3 pages appendix, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Neural Parametric 3D Breast Shape Models for Metrical Surface Reconstruction From Monocular RGB Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13540v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach -- inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2 mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

This paper provides a framework for bounding the best low-rank approximation error of matrices arising from samples of a kernel that is analytically continuable in one of its variables to an open region of the complex plane. Elegantly, the low-rank approximations used in the proof are computable by rational interpolation using the roots and poles of Zolotarev rational functions, leading to a fast algorithm for their construction.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

This study investigates the knowledge, expertise, and buying habits of people who shop using cryptocurrencies. Our survey of 516 participants shows that knowledge levels vary from beginners to experts. Interestingly, a segment of respondents, nearly 30%, showed high purchase frequency despite their limited knowledge. Regression analyses indicated that while domain knowledge plays a role, it only accounts for 11.6% of the factors affecting purchasing frequency. A K-means cluster analysis further segmented the respondents into three distinct groups, each having unique knowledge levels and purchasing tendencies. These results challenge the conventional idea linking extensive knowledge to increased cryptocurrency usage, suggesting other factors at play. Understanding this varying crypto-shopper demographic is pivotal for businesses, emphasizing the need for tailored strategies and user-friendly experiences. This study offers insights into current crypto-shopping behaviors and discusses future research exploring the broader impacts and potential shifts in the crypto-consumer landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint was based on Cryptorefills Labs Research Paper (13 Pages).

Inspired by this organization, we propose Mixture of Cognitive Reasoners (MiCRo): a modular, transformer-based architecture post-trained with a curriculum that induces functional specialization across experts. Concretely, we partition the layers of a pretrained language model into four expert modules aligned with well-studied cognitive networks in the human brain. MiCRo offers three key advantages over standard language models. (1) The specialized experts are interpretable and causally meaningful -- ablating a module causes substantial drops on benchmarks requiring its specialized domain. (2) MiCRo's behavior can be dynamically steered at inference time by routing tokens to particular experts (e.g., favoring social over logical reasoning), enabling fine-grained control over outputs. (3) MiCRo outperforms or matches comparable baselines on both machine-learning reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K, BBH) and alignment to human behavior (CogBench), while maintaining interpretability. Taken together, cognitively grounded functional specialization yields models that are both more human-like and more human-interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Applications in Food Analysis -- Improving Algorithms and Methodologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13452v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a 2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still, PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach. Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values. Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally, this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a new algorithm.</p></details> | PhD thesis |
| **[Toward Efficient Inference Attacks: Shadow Model Sharing via Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13451v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are often vulnerable to inference attacks that expose sensitive information from their training data. Shadow model technique is commonly employed in such attacks, such as membership inference. However, the need for a large number of shadow models leads to high computational costs, limiting their practical applicability. Such inefficiency mainly stems from the independent training and use of these shadow models. To address this issue, we present a novel shadow pool training framework SHAPOOL, which constructs multiple shared models and trains them jointly within a single process. In particular, we leverage the Mixture-of-Experts mechanism as the shadow pool to interconnect individual models, enabling them to share some sub-networks and thereby improving efficiency. To ensure the shared models closely resemble independent models and serve as effective substitutes, we introduce three novel modules: path-choice routing, pathway regularization, and pathway alignment. These modules guarantee random data allocation for pathway learning, promote diversity among shared models, and maintain consistency with target models. We evaluate SHAPOOL in the context of various membership inference attacks and show that it significantly reduces the computational cost of shadow model construction while maintaining comparable attack performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Pixels: A Differentiable Pipeline for Probing Neuronal Selectivity in 3D](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13433v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape, pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels, making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting. This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond conventional pixel-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Symmetry and Geometry in Neural Representations 2025 (Extended Abstract Track)</p></details> |
| **[CoDS: Enhancing Collaborative Perception in Heterogeneous Scenarios via Domain Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13432v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively. Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios. The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

A key challenge with trigonometric functions concerns range reduction with "pi", which reduces a given input in the domain of a 32-bit float to a small domain. Any rounding error in the value of "pi" is amplified during range reduction, which can result in wrong results. We describe our experience implementing fast range reduction techniques that maintain a large number of bits of "pi" both with floating-point and integer computations. The resulting implementations for trigonometric functions are fast and produce correctly rounded results for all inputs for multiple representations up to 32-bits with a single implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings VSS 2025, arXiv:2510.12314</p></details> |

With the help of LLM inference frameworks, such as llama.cpp, which support optimizations such as KV-caching and quantization, it is now easier than ever to deploy LLMs on edge devices. Quantization is fundamental to enable LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices, and llama.cpp utilizes block floating point (BFP) quantization to drastically reduce the bit width of weights and input tensors, the memory footprint, and the computational power required to run LLMs. LLMs are typically quantized with mixed BFP quantization across the model layers to reduce the loss of model accuracy due to quantization. Therefore, to efficiently accelerate across the layers of BFP-quantized LLMs, specialized accelerators need to support different BFP variants without reconfiguration. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible Block FloatingPoint Quantization (F-BFQ) accelerator, which can dynamically switch between two BFP quantization variants and perform matrix multiplication (MatMul) operations. Our initial F-BFQ accelerator design, deployed on the AMD Kria board, reduces inference time by 1.4x on average over the Arm NEON-based CPU execution across three BFP quantized LLMs while achieving 5.2 tokens per second (~3.9 words per second).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Workshop on New Approaches for Addressing the Computing Requirements of LLMs and GNNs (LG-ARC) @ ISCA 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world AIoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICPADS 2025</p></details> |

Our model extends the proportional hazards model by introducing several weakly-parametric elements: the marginal baseline hazard functions are expressed as piecewise constants, association is modelled with copulas, and nonlinear covariate effects are handled by a single-index structure using a spline. The model permits a full likelihood approach to inference, making it possible to obtain individual-level survival or hazard function estimates. Performance of the new model is evaluated through simulation studies and application to the Busselton health study data. The results suggest that the proposed method can capture nonlinear covariate effects well, and that there is benefit to modeling the association between the correlated responses.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Unlike classical approaches in statistical inference, our approach avoids explicitly estimating the conditional probabilities. We propose a non-parametric guessing function with a learning rate independent of the alphabet size. Our analysis focuses on a broad class of time series models that encompasses finite-order Markov chains, some hidden Markov chains, Poisson regression for count processes, and one-dimensional Gibbs measures. We provide a margin condition that controls the rate of convergence for the risk. Additionally, we establish a minimax lower bound for the convergence rate of the risk associated with our guessing problem. This lower bound matches the upper bound achieved by our estimator up to a logarithmic factor, demonstrating its near-optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, re-submitted.

| **[D-SMART: Enhancing LLM Dialogue Consistency via Dynamic Structured Memory And Reasoning Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13363v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic, structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures (main content); 25 pages, 18 figures (total)</p></details> |

In this context, we investigate three strategies applied specifically to GNSS pseudorange observations: robust statistics for error mitigation, machine learning for faulty measurement prediction, and Bayesian inference for noise distribution approximation. Since previous studies have provided limited insight into the theoretical foundations and practical evaluations of these three methodologies within a unified problem statement (i.e., state estimation using ranging sensors), we conduct extensive experiments using real-world sensor data collected in diverse urban environments. Our goal is to examine both established techniques and newly proposed methods, thereby advancing the understanding of how to handle faulty range measurements, such as GNSS, for robust, long-term vehicle localization. In addition to presenting successful results, this work highlights critical observations and open questions to motivate future research in robust state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2nd Workshop on Safety of Intelligent and Autonomous Vehicles: Formal Methods vs. Machine Learning approaches for reliable navigation (SIAV-FM2L) at IEEE IROS2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender, age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards improved security.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13329v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Removing Cost Volumes from Optical Flow Estimators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13317v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets. Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being $1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at $20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Investigating the interaction of linguistic and mathematical reasoning in language models using multilingual number puzzles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13886v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Across languages, numeral systems vary widely in how they construct and combine numbers. While humans consistently learn to navigate this diversity, large language models (LLMs) struggle with linguistic-mathematical puzzles involving cross-linguistic numeral systems, which humans can learn to solve successfully. We investigate why this task is difficult for LLMs through a series of experiments that untangle the linguistic and mathematical aspects of numbers in language. Our experiments establish that models cannot consistently solve such problems unless the mathematical operations in the problems are explicitly marked using known symbols ($+$, $\times$, etc., as in "twenty + three"). In further ablation studies, we probe how individual parameters of numeral construction and combination affect performance. While humans use their linguistic understanding of numbers to make inferences about the implicit compositional structure of numerals, LLMs seem to lack this notion of implicit numeral structure. We conclude that the ability to flexibly infer compositional rules from implicit patterns in human-scale data remains an open challenge for current reasoning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation via Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13307v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation (3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method, i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mismatch Aware Guidance for Robust Emotion Control in Auto-Regressive TTS Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13293v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech, undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and intelligibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Power-laws in phylogenetic trees and the preferential coalescent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13270v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among species and reflect the forces that shaped them. While many studies rely on branch length information, the topology of phylogenetic trees (particularly their degree of imbalance) offers a robust framework for inferring evolutionary dynamics when timing data is uncertain. Classical metrics, such as the Colless and Sackin indices, quantify tree imbalance and have been extensively used to characterize phylogenies. Empirical phylogenies typically show intermediate imbalance, falling between perfectly balanced and highly skewed trees. This regime is marked by a power-law relationship between subtree sizes and their cumulative sizes, governed by a characteristic exponent. Although a recent niche-size model replicates this scaling, its mathematical origin and the exponent's value remain unclear. We present a generative model inspired by Kingman's coalescent that incorporates niche-like dynamics through preferential node coalescence. This process maps to Smoluchowski's coagulation kinetics and is described by a generalized Smoluchowski equation. Our model produces imbalanced trees with power-law exponents matching empirical and numerical observations, revealing the mathematical basis of observed scaling laws and offering new tools to interpret tree imbalance in evolutionary contexts.</p></details> | 7 pages |

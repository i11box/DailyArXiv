| **[EMLoC: Emulator-based Memory-efficient Fine-tuning with LoRA Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12015v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development, enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

| **[code_transformed: The Influence of Large Language Models on Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12014v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |
| **[Tracing LLM Reasoning Processes with Strategic Games: A Framework for Planning, Revision, and Resource-Constrained Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12012v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks that require complex reasoning. Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed, rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models, ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7 percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of 0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6 percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093), suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how they arrive at those decisions</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures.

| **[An Efficient Compression of Deep Neural Network Checkpoints Based on Prediction and Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12000v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it suitable for storage-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE NW Russia Young Researchers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering Conference (EIConRusNW)</p></details> |
| **[Generative Representational Learning of Foundation Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11999v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a single foundation model with the capability to excel across diverse tasks has been a long-standing objective in the field of artificial intelligence. As the wave of general-purpose foundation models sweeps across various domains, their influence has significantly extended to the field of recommendation systems. While recent efforts have explored recommendation foundation models for various generative tasks, they often overlook crucial embedding tasks and struggle with the complexities of multi-task learning, including knowledge sharing & conflict resolution, and convergence speed inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we introduce RecFound, a generative representational learning framework for recommendation foundation models. We construct the first comprehensive dataset for recommendation foundation models covering both generative and embedding tasks across diverse scenarios. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel multi-task training scheme featuring a Task-wise Mixture of Low-rank Experts (TMoLE) to handle knowledge sharing & conflict, a Step-wise Convergence-oriented Sample Scheduler (S2Sched) to address inconsistent convergence, and a Model Merge module to balance the performance across tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RecFound achieves state-of-the-art performance across various recommendation tasks, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://junkfood436.github.io/RecFound/</p></details> |

Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300 features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels, including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics. NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Compression Aware Certified Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11992v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained environments must balance efficiency and robustness. Existing methods treat compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed. We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of datasets and input specifications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 1 figure |
| **[VGR: Visual Grounded Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11991v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Simple Radiology VLLM Test-time Scaling with Thought Graph Traversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11989v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths. Code and prompts are open-sourced for reproducibility at https://github.com/glerium/Thought-Graph-Traversal.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.11209 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Schema-R1: A reasoning training approach for schema linking in Text-to-SQL Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11986v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Schema linking is a critical step in Text-to-SQL task, aiming to accurately predict the table names and column names required for the SQL query based on the given question. However, current fine-tuning approaches for schema linking models employ a rote-learning paradigm, excessively optimizing for ground truth schema linking outcomes while compromising reasoning ability. This limitation arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1 consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking model, achieving a 10\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing method. Our code is available at https://github.com/hongWin/Schema-R1/.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11982v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text 10 pages, total document 16 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Specification and Evaluation of Multi-Agent LLM Systems -- Prototype and Cybersecurity Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10467v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g., through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for a possible publication.

| **[CnC-PRAC: Coalesce, not Cache, Per Row Activation Counts for an Efficient in-DRAM Rowhammer Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11970v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>JEDEC has introduced the Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) framework for DDR5 and future DRAMs to enable precise counting of DRAM row activations using per-row activation counts. While recent PRAC implementations enable holistic mitigation of Rowhammer attacks, they impose slowdowns of up to 10% due to the increased DRAM timings for performing a read-modify-write of the counter. Alternatively, recent work, Chronus, addresses these slowdowns, but incurs energy overheads due to the additional DRAM activations for counters. In this paper, we propose CnC-PRAC, a PRAC implementation that addresses both performance and energy overheads. Unlike prior works focusing on caching activation counts to reduce their overheads, our key idea is to reorder and coalesce accesses to activation counts located in the same physical row. Our design achieves this by decoupling counter access from the critical path of data accesses. This enables optimizations such as buffering counter read-modify-write requests and coalescing requests to the same row. Together, these enable a reduction in row activations for counter accesses by almost 75%-83% compared to state-of-the-art solutions like Chronus and enable a PRAC implementation with negligible slowdown and a minimal dynamic energy overhead of 0.84%-1% compared to insecure DDR5 DRAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, including appendices.

Given that each time point provides only a static snapshot, modeling and understanding the underlying cellular dynamics remains a central yet challenging task in modern genomics. To associate biological time with single cell distributions, we develop a robust local Fr\'echet regression for interpolating the high-dimensional cellular distribution at any given time point using data observed over a finite time points. To allow for robustness in cell distributions, we propose to apply the unbalanced optimal transport-based Wasserstein distance in our local Fr\'echet regression analysis. We develop a computationally efficient algorithm to generate the cell distribution for a given time point using generative neural networks. The resulting single cell generated models and the corresponding transport plans can be use to interpolate the single cells at any unobserved time point and to track the cell trajectory during the cell differentiation process. We demonstrate the methods using three single cell differentiation data sets, including differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into embryoids, mouse hematopoietic and progenitor cell differentiation, and reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We show that the proposed methods lead to better single cell interpolations, reveal different cell differential trajectories, and identify early genes that regulate these cell trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 3 main figures and 5 supplementary figures</p></details> |

Traditional citation frameworks -- grounded in credibility, retrievability, and authorship -- struggle to accommodate the dynamic and ephemeral nature of AI outputs. In this paper, we examine how undergraduate students in a UX design course approached AI usage and citation when given the freedom to integrate generative tools into their design process. Through qualitative analysis of 35 team projects and reflections from 175 students, we identify varied citation practices ranging from formal attribution to indirect or absent acknowledgment. These inconsistencies reveal gaps in existing frameworks and raise questions about authorship, assessment, and pedagogical transparency. We argue for rethinking AI citation as a reflective and pedagogical practice; one that supports metacognitive engagement by prompting students to critically evaluate how and why they used AI throughout the design process. We propose alternative strategies -- such as AI contribution statements and process-aware citation models that better align with the iterative and reflective nature of design education. This work invites educators to reconsider how citation practices can support meaningful student--AI collaboration.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, EduCHI 2025: 7th Annual Symposium on HCI Education, Bloomington, IN, USA, July 2025</p></details> |

While low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features. The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and other speech-related applications.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

This insight leads to certain constructs and proofs being shorter, simpler, and more intuitive when expressed in the spacetime game framework than in the causal contextuality scenario framework. The equivalence of categories and the modular structure of causal contextuality theory also implies that it is possible to build (pure) strategy sheaves, mixed strategy presheaves (equivalent to distribution presheaves) and empirical models on top of spacetime games: the obstruction to a global section in the presence of contextuality corresponds to the non-existence of a mixed strategy in the sense of the Nash game theory framework. This shows that the insights of both frameworks taken together can contribute positively to advancing the field of quantum foundations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated technical report, 52 pages.

| **[Automated Treatment Planning for Interstitial HDR Brachytherapy for Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11957v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy plays a critical role in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer but remains highly dependent on manual treatment planning expertise. The objective of this study is to develop a fully automated HDR brachytherapy planning framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and dose-based optimization to generate clinically acceptable treatment plans with improved consistency and efficiency. We propose a hierarchical two-stage autoplanning framework. In the first stage, a deep Q-network (DQN)-based RL agent iteratively selects treatment planning parameters (TPPs), which control the trade-offs between target coverage and organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. The agent's state representation includes both dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics and current TPP values, while its reward function incorporates clinical dose objectives and safety constraints, including D90, V150, V200 for targets, and D2cc for all relevant OARs (bladder, rectum, sigmoid, small bowel, and large bowel). In the second stage, a customized Adam-based optimizer computes the corresponding dwell time distribution for the selected TPPs using a clinically informed loss function. The framework was evaluated on a cohort of patients with complex applicator geometries. The proposed framework successfully learned clinically meaningful TPP adjustments across diverse patient anatomies. For the unseen test patients, the RL-based automated planning method achieved an average score of 93.89%, outperforming the clinical plans which averaged 91.86%. These findings are notable given that score improvements were achieved while maintaining full target coverage and reducing CTV hot spots in most cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

It examines whether LMs can correctly associate a temporal context with a past fact valid over a defined period, by asking them to differentiate correct from incorrect contexts. The LMs' ability to distinguish is analyzed along two dimensions: the distance of the incorrect context from the validity period and the granularity of the context. To this end, a dataset called TimeStress is introduced, enabling the evaluation of 18 diverse LMs. Results reveal that the best LM achieves a perfect distinction for only 11% of the studied facts, with errors, certainly rare, but critical that humans would not make. This work highlights the limitations of current LMs in temporal representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint v5, accepted for publication at ACL 2025 - L2M2 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Self-interpreting Adversarial Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08970v4)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new type of indirect, cross-modal injection attacks against visual language models that enable creation of self-interpreting images. These images contain hidden "meta-instructions" that control how models answer users' questions about the image and steer models' outputs to express an adversary-chosen style, sentiment, or point of view. Self-interpreting images act as soft prompts, conditioning the model to satisfy the adversary's (meta-)objective while still producing answers based on the image's visual content. Meta-instructions are thus a stronger form of prompt injection. Adversarial images look natural and the model's answers are coherent and plausible, yet they also follow the adversary-chosen interpretation, e.g., political spin, or even objectives that are not achievable with explicit text instructions. We evaluate the efficacy of self-interpreting images for a variety of models, interpretations, and user prompts. We describe how these attacks could cause harm by enabling creation of self-interpreting content that carries spam, misinformation, or spin. Finally, we discuss defenses.</p></details> | <details><summary>in US...</summary><p>in USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |

That lack of transparency can be problematic, especially in fields where trust and accountability matter. To help with this, we introduce SMILE, a new method that explains how these models respond to different parts of a prompt. SMILE is model-agnostic and works by slightly changing the input, measuring how the output changes, and then highlighting which words had the most impact. Create simple visual heat maps showing which parts of a prompt matter the most. We tested SMILE on several leading LLMs and used metrics such as accuracy, consistency, stability, and fidelity to show that it gives clear and reliable explanations. By making these models easier to understand, SMILE brings us one step closer to making AI more transparent and trustworthy.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.16277</p></details> |
| **[Today's Cat Is Tomorrow's Dog: Accounting for Time-Based Changes in the Labels of ML Vulnerability Detection Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11939v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability datasets used for ML testing implicitly contain retrospective information. When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul, ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker).

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |
| **[Uniform Sampling of Surfaces by Casting Rays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05268v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomly sampling points on surfaces is an essential operation in geometry processing. This sampling is computationally straightforward on explicit meshes, but it is much more difficult on other shape representations, such as widely-used implicit surfaces. This work studies a simple and general scheme for sampling points on a surface, which is derived from a connection to the intersections of random rays with the surface. Concretely, given a subroutine to cast a ray against a surface and find all intersections, we can use that subroutine to uniformly sample white noise points on the surface. This approach is particularly effective in the context of implicit signed distance functions, where sphere marching allows us to efficiently cast rays and sample points, without needing to extract an intermediate mesh. We analyze the basic method to show that it guarantees uniformity, and find experimentally that it is significantly more efficient than alternative strategies on a variety of representations. Furthermore, we show extensions to blue noise sampling and stratified sampling, and applications to deform neural implicit surfaces as well as moment estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures, Symposium on Geometry Processing 2025</p></details> |

However, its connection with the training of generative models remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we show that the evolution of time-varying generative models can be projected onto an exponential family manifold, naturally creating a link between the parameters of a generative model and those of a probabilistic model. We then train the generative model by moving its projection on the manifold according to the natural gradient descent scheme. This approach also allows us to efficiently approximate the natural gradient of the KL divergence without relying on MCMC for intractable models. Furthermore, we propose particle versions of the algorithm, which feature closed-form update rules for any parametric model within the exponential family. Through toy and real-world experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The code of the proposed algorithms can be found at https://github.com/anewgithubname/iNGD.</p></details> | UAI2025 |
| **[New Dataset and Methods for Fine-Grained Compositional Referring Expression Comprehension via Specialist-MLLM Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20104v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a foundational cross-modal task that evaluates the interplay of language understanding, image comprehension, and language-to-image grounding. It serves as an essential testing ground for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To advance this field, we introduced a new REC dataset in our previous conference paper, characterized by two key features. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring multi-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and multi-hop relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images generated through fine-grained editing and augmentation, explicitly testing a model's ability to reject scenarios where the target object is absent, an often overlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. In this extended work, we propose two new methods to tackle the challenges of fine-grained REC by combining the strengths of Specialist Models and MLLMs. The first method adaptively assigns simple cases to faster, lightweight models and reserves complex ones for powerful MLLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The second method lets a specialist generate a set of possible object regions, and the MLLM selects the most plausible one using its reasoning ability. These collaborative strategies lead to significant improvements on our dataset and other challenging benchmarks. Our results show that combining specialized and general-purpose models offers a practical path toward solving complex real-world vision-language tasks.

However, existing approaches mainly rely on imitation learning and struggle to achieve effective test-time scaling. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for enabling self-exploration, recent attempts yield modest improvements in complex reasoning. In this paper, we present T1 to scale RL by encouraging exploration and understand inference scaling. We first initialize the LLM using synthesized chain-of-thought data that integrates trial-and-error and self-verification. To scale RL training, we promote increased sampling diversity through oversampling. We demonstrate that T1 with open LLMs as its base exhibits inference scaling behavior and achieves superior performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. More importantly, we present a simple strategy to examine inference scaling, where increased inference budgets directly lead to T1's better performance without any additional verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

SAR ship images present challenges including scale variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness and generalization on SAR ship datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

In this work, we leverage an unconditional diffusion model trained only on clean speech for the assessment of speech quality. We show that the quality of a speech utterance can be assessed by estimating the likelihood of a corresponding sample in the terminating Gaussian distribution, obtained via a deterministic noising process. The resulting method is purely unsupervised, trained only on clean speech, and therefore does not rely on annotations. Our diffusion-based approach leverages clean speech priors to assess quality based on how the input relates to the learned distribution of clean data. Our proposed log-likelihoods show promising results, correlating well with intrusive speech quality metrics and showing the best correlation with human scores in a listening experiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |

CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed. We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of datasets and input specifications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 1 figure |

Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching the 100 millions, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce AB-UPT as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for CFD simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a CAD geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features (Spotter) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.</p></details> | <details><summary>for a...</summary><p>for associated mpeg file, see http://github.com/bfly123/DeePoly</p></details> |

Existing compression methods homogenize head dimensions or rely on attention-guided token pruning, often sacrificing accuracy or introducing computational overhead. We propose FourierAttention, a training-free framework that exploits the heterogeneous roles of transformer head dimensions: lower dimensions prioritize local context, while upper ones capture long-range dependencies. By projecting the long-context-insensitive dimensions onto orthogonal Fourier bases, FourierAttention approximates their temporal evolution with fixed-length spectral coefficients. Evaluations on LLaMA models show that FourierAttention achieves the best long-context accuracy on LongBench and Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH).

However, these methods are typically implemented by stacking deeper networks or leveraging transformer-based attention mechanisms, which consequently increases model complexity. In contrast, model-driven methods based on the unfolding paradigm show promise in improving performance while effectively maintaining model compactness through sophisticated module design. Based on these insights, we propose a Structural Similarity-Inspired Unfolding (SSIU) method for efficient image SR. This method is designed through unfolding an SR optimization function constrained by structural similarity, aiming to combine the strengths of both data-driven and model-driven approaches. Our model operates progressively following the unfolding paradigm. Each iteration consists of multiple Mixed-Scale Gating Modules (MSGM) and an Efficient Sparse Attention Module (ESAM). The former implements comprehensive constraints on features, including a structural similarity constraint, while the latter aims to achieve sparse activation. In addition, we design a Mixture-of-Experts-based Feature Selector (MoE-FS) that fully utilizes multi-level feature information by combining features from different steps. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy and efficiency of our unfolding-inspired network.

However, their effectiveness remains limited by the fixed context window of the transformer architecture, posing challenges for long-context modeling. Among these challenges, length generalization -- the ability to generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training -- is a classical and fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a fresh perspective on length generalization, shifting the focus from the conventional emphasis on input features such as positional encodings or data structures to the output distribution of the model. Specifically, through case studies on synthetic tasks, we highlight the critical role of \textbf{long-short alignment} -- the consistency of output distributions across sequences of varying lengths. Extending this insight to natural language tasks, we propose a metric called Long-Short Misalignment to quantify this phenomenon, uncovering a strong correlation between the metric and length generalization performance. Building on these findings, we develop a regularization term that promotes long-short alignment during training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, offering new insights for achieving more effective long-context modeling in LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ML/LongShortAlignment.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, educators face significant challenges in interacting with these models, particularly due to complex prompt engineering and usability issues, which increase workload. Additionally, inaccuracies in LLM outputs can raise issues around output quality and ethical concerns in educational content delivery. Addressing these issues requires careful oversight, best achieved through cooperation between human and AI approaches. This paper introduces two novel User Interface (UI) designs, UI Predefined and UI Open, both grounded in Direct Manipulation (DM) principles to address these challenges. By reducing the reliance on intricate prompt engineering, these UIs improve usability, streamline interaction, and lower workload, providing a more effective pathway for educators to engage with LLMs. In a controlled user study with 20 participants, the proposed UIs were evaluated against the standard ChatGPT interface in terms of usability and cognitive load. Results showed that UI Predefined significantly outperformed both ChatGPT and UI Open, demonstrating superior usability and reduced task load, while UI Open offered more flexibility at the cost of a steeper learning curve.

By autonomously orchestrating multistep web exploration, targeted retrieval, and higher-order synthesis, they transform vast amounts of online information into analyst-grade, citation-rich reports--compressing hours of manual desk research into minutes. However, a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating the capabilities of these agents remains absent. To bridge this gap, we present DeepResearch Bench, a benchmark consisting of 100 PhD-level research tasks, each meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields. Evaluating DRAs is inherently complex and labor-intensive. We therefore propose two novel methodologies that achieve strong alignment with human judgment. The first is a reference-based method with adaptive criteria to assess the quality of generated research reports. The other framework is introduced to evaluate DRA's information retrieval and collection capabilities by assessing its effective citation count and overall citation accuracy. We have open-sourced DeepResearch Bench and key components of these frameworks at https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench to accelerate the development of practical LLM-based agents.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |

While prior research primarily focused on explicitly aligning these representations through targeted learning objectives and model architectures, a recent line of work has found that independently trained unimodal models of increasing scale and performance can become implicitly aligned with each other. These findings raise fundamental questions regarding the emergence of aligned representations in multimodal learning. Specifically: (1) when and why does alignment emerge implicitly? and (2) is alignment a reliable indicator of performance? Through a comprehensive empirical investigation, we demonstrate that both the emergence of alignment and its relationship with task performance depend on several critical data characteristics. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the degree of similarity between the modalities and the balance between redundant and unique information they provide for the task. Our findings suggest that alignment may not be universally beneficial; rather, its impact on performance varies depending on the dataset and task.

The advantages of FT, such as high efficiency and a global view, have been rapidly explored and exploited in various time series tasks and applications, demonstrating the promising potential of FT as a new deep learning paradigm for time series analysis. Despite the growing attention and the proliferation of research in this emerging field, there is currently a lack of a systematic review and in-depth analysis of deep learning-based time series models with FT. It is also unclear why FT can enhance time series analysis and what its limitations are in the field. To address these gaps, we present a comprehensive review that systematically investigates and summarizes the recent research advancements in deep learning-based time series analysis with FT. Specifically, we explore the primary approaches used in current models that incorporate FT, the types of neural networks that leverage FT, and the representative FT-equipped models in deep time series analysis. We propose a novel taxonomy to categorize the existing methods in this field, providing a structured overview of the diverse approaches employed in incorporating FT into deep learning models for time series analysis. Finally, we highlight the advantages and limitations of FT for time series modeling and identify potential future research directions that can further contribute to the community of time series analysis.</p></details> | Accepted By KDD 2025 |

To achieve this, we aim to connect a formal mathematical framework - zigzag persistence from topological data analysis - with practical and easily applicable algorithms. Zigzag persistence is particularly effective for characterizing data as it dynamically transforms across model layers. Within this framework, we introduce topological descriptors that measure how topological features, $p$-dimensional holes, persist and evolve throughout the layers. Unlike methods that assess each layer individually and then aggregate the results, our approach directly tracks the full evolutionary path of these features. This offers a statistical perspective on how prompts are rearranged and their relative positions changed in the representation space, providing insights into the system's operation as an integrated whole. To demonstrate the expressivity and applicability of our framework, we highlight how sensitive these descriptors are to different models and a variety of datasets. As a showcase application to a downstream task, we use zigzag persistence to establish a criterion for layer pruning, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preserving the system-level perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+17...</summary><p>10+17 pages, 17 figures, 3 tables.

| **[DMAF-Net: An Effective Modality Rebalancing Framework for Incomplete Multi-Modal Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11691v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020 demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation.

The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90% mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately 62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.</p></details> | 7 pages, 9 figures |

It is profoundly impacted by deep learning methods, which can characterize complex connections between ROIs. However, the research on foundation models of brain network is limited and constrained to a single dimension, which restricts their extensive application in neuroscience. In this study, we propose a fine-tuned brain network model for brain disease diagnosis. It expands brain region representations across multiple dimensions based on the original brain network model, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Our model consists of two key modules: (1)an adapter module that expands brain region features across different dimensions. (2)a fine-tuned foundation brain network model, based on self-supervised learning and pre-trained on fMRI data from thousands of participants. Specifically, its transformer block is able to effectively extract brain region features and compute the inter-region associations. Moreover, we derive a compact latent representation of the brain network for brain disease diagnosis. Our downstream experiments in this study demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior performance in brain disease diagnosis, which potentially offers a promising approach in brain network analysis research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, International Conference on Neural Computing for Advanced Applications</p></details> |

Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex, implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause, effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20 few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

This challenge is evident in applications such as multi-view and multi-class scenarios. To address this challenge, we developed MiniMaxAD, a efficient autoencoder designed to efficiently compress and memorize extensive information from normal images. Our model employs a technique that enhances feature diversity, thereby increasing the effective capacity of the network. It also utilizes large kernel convolution to extract highly abstract patterns, which contribute to efficient and compact feature embedding. Moreover, we introduce an Adaptive Contraction Hard Mining Loss (ADCLoss), specifically tailored to FRADs.

The asymptotic nature of the scattering operator (involving unbounded time) makes its computation particularly challenging. We overcome this by exploiting the space-time compactification provided by the lens transform, marking the first use of this technique in numerical simulations. This results in a highly efficient and reliable methodology for computing the scattering operator in various regimes. In developing this approach we introduce and prove several new identities and theoretical properties of the scattering operator. We support our construction with several numerical experiments which we show to agree with known analytical properties of the scattering operator, and also address the case of long-range scattering for the one-dimensional cubic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Our simulations permit us to further explore regimes beyond current analytical understanding, and lead us to formulate new conjectures concerning fixed and rotating points of the operator, as well as its existence in the long-range setting for both defocusing and focusing cases.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Concurrently, advancements in onboard satellite computing and communication technologies have greatly enhanced data compression efficiency, reducing network latency and congestion while supporting near real-time information delivery. In this paper, we address the Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP), which involves determining the optimal sequence of target observations to maximize overall observation profit. Our approach integrates onboard data processing for real-time remote monitoring into the multi-satellite optimization problem. To this end, we define a set of priority indicators and develop a constructive heuristic method, further enhanced with a Local Search (LS) strategy. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides high-quality information by increasing the resolution of the collected frames by up to 10% on average, while reducing the variance in the monitoring frequency of the targets within the instance by up to 83%, ensuring more up-to-date information across the entire set compared to a First-In First-Out (FIFO) method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

As video frame rates continue to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods, which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR) demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing, the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time.

Nevertheless, current PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization.

Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 2B and datasets of OpenWebText, MiniPile, and C4. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

While ViTs generally outperform CNNs by effectively capturing long-range dependencies and input-specific characteristics, their computational complexity increases quadratically with image resolution. This limitation hampers their practical application in high-resolution image restoration. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) for visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. In addition, to more effectively capture and represent local information, we propose an efficient discriminative frequency domain-based feedforward network (EDFFN), which can effectively estimate useful frequency information for latent clear image restoration. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and real-world images.

This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, RA-L submission</p></details> |

However, in the context of limited and noisy data, accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions. Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables, by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI) transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state (vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |

Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

Typically, this information is extracted during a data pre-processing or engineering phase. However, this step is often performed in an ad-hoc manner and is time-consuming and labour-intensive. To streamline this process, we introduce a reference model and a collection of patterns designed to enrich production event data. The reference model provides a standard way for storing and extracting production event data. The patterns describe common information extraction tasks and how such tasks can be automated effectively. The reference model is developed by combining the ISA-95 industry standard with the Event Knowledge Graph formalism. The patterns are developed based on empirical observations from event data sets originating in manufacturing processes and are formalised using the reference model.

However, fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set. Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module, which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities. Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to individual users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest X-ray reports.

However, existing IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts. We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components: (1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets, (3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world.

However, existing approaches mainly rely on imitation learning and struggle to achieve effective test-time scaling. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for enabling self-exploration, recent attempts yield modest improvements in complex reasoning. In this paper, we present T1 to scale RL by encouraging exploration and understand inference scaling. We first initialize the LLM using synthesized chain-of-thought data that integrates trial-and-error and self-verification. To scale RL training, we promote increased sampling diversity through oversampling. We demonstrate that T1 with open LLMs as its base exhibits inference scaling behavior and achieves superior performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. More importantly, we present a simple strategy to examine inference scaling, where increased inference budgets directly lead to T1's better performance without any additional verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

Its architecture, informed by a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, was trained exclusively on modality-agnostic synthetic data. MindGrab was evaluated on a retrospective dataset of 606 multimodal adult-brain scans (T1, T2, DWI, MRA, PDw MRI, EPI, CT, PET) sourced from the SynthStrip dataset. Performance was benchmarked against SynthStrip, ROBEX, and BET using Dice scores, with Wilcoxon signed-rank significance tests. MindGrab achieved a mean Dice score of 95.9 with standard deviation (SD) 1.6 across modalities, significantly outperforming classical methods (ROBEX: 89.1 SD 7.7, P < 0.05; BET: 85.2 SD 14.4, P < 0.05). Compared to SynthStrip (96.5 SD 1.1, P=0.0352), MindGrab delivered equivalent or superior performance in nearly half of the tested scenarios, with minor differences (<3% Dice) in the others. MindGrab utilized 95% fewer parameters (146,237 vs. 2,566,561) than SynthStrip. This efficiency yielded at least 2x faster inference, 50% lower memory usage on GPUs, and enabled exceptional performance (e.g., 10-30x speedup, and up to 30x memory reduction) and accessibility on a wider range of hardware, including systems without high-end GPUs.

| **[Learning Overspecified Gaussian Mixtures Exponentially Fast with the EM Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11850v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and density estimation tasks.</p></details> | ECML PKDD 2025 |

Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.</p></details> | Accepted to RLC 25 |

This trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source, synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency, (de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

This transition enhances computational throughput, reduces memory and bandwidth usage, and improves energy efficiency, offering significant advantages for resource-constrained edge devices. To support this shift, hardware architectures have evolved accordingly, now including adapted ISAs (Instruction Set Architectures) that expose mixed-precision vector units and matrix engines tailored for DL workloads. At the heart of many DL and scientific computing tasks is the general matrix-matrix multiplication gemm, a fundamental kernel historically optimized using axpy vector instructions on SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) units. However, as hardware moves toward mixed-precision dot-product-centric operations optimized for quantized inference, these legacy approaches are being phased out. In response to this, our paper revisits traditional high-performance gemm and describes strategies for adapting it to mixed-precision integer (MIP) arithmetic across modern ISAs, including x86_64, ARM, and RISC-V. Concretely, we illustrate novel micro-kernel designs and data layouts that better exploit today's specialized hardware and demonstrate significant performance gains from MIP arithmetic over floating-point implementations across three representative CPU architectures. These contributions highlight a new era of gemm optimization-driven by the demands of DL inference on heterogeneous architectures, marking what we term as the "Cambrian period" for matrix multiplication.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |

Compared to non-generative LLMs like BERT and DeBERTa, generative LLMs like GPT series and Llama series are currently the main focus due to their superior algorithmic performance. The advancements in generative LLMs are closely intertwined with the development of hardware capabilities. Various hardware platforms exhibit distinct hardware characteristics, which can help improve LLM inference performance. Therefore, this paper comprehensively surveys efficient generative LLM inference on different hardware platforms. First, we provide an overview of the algorithm architecture of mainstream generative LLMs and delve into the inference process. Then, we summarize different optimization methods for different platforms such as CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC, and PIM/NDP, and provide inference results for generative LLMs. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of inference performance with batch sizes 1 and 8 on different hardware platforms by considering hardware power consumption, absolute inference speed (tokens/s), and energy efficiency (tokens/J). We compare the performance of the same optimization methods across different hardware platforms, the performance across different hardware platforms, and the performance of different methods on the same hardware platform. This provides a systematic and comprehensive summary of existing inference acceleration work by integrating software optimization methods and hardware platforms. We point out that three trends (multimodality, inference-time compute, and higher inference energy efficiency) are promising to redefine the capabilities of edge artificial intelligence systems.

This paper challenges the assumption of monolithic preferences by introducing Configurable Preference Tuning (CPT), a novel framework for endowing language models with the ability to dynamically adjust their behavior based on explicit, human-interpretable directives. CPT leverages synthetically generated preference data, conditioned on system prompts derived from structured, fine-grained rubrics that define desired attributes like writing style. By fine-tuning with these rubric-guided preferences, the LLM learns to modulate its outputs at inference time in response to the system prompt, without retraining. This approach not only offers fine-grained control but also provides a mechanism for modeling more nuanced and context-dependent human feedback. Several experimental artifacts, such as training code, generated datasets and fine-tuned models are released at https://github.com/vicgalle/configurable-preference-tuning</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 Workshop on Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment</p></details> |
| **[Intra-Trajectory Consistency for Reward Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09096v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

However, efficiently extending these models to accommodate sequential tasks remains challenging. As new tasks arrive, naive model expansion leads to rapid parameter growth, while modifying shared routing components often causes catastrophic forgetting, undermining previously learned knowledge. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-CMoE, a continual learning framework for LLMs that requires no replay data of previous tasks and ensures both parameter efficiency and robust knowledge retention. Our approach introduces a Probe-Guided Knowledge Extension mechanism, which uses probe experts to dynamically determine when and where new experts should be added, enabling adaptive and minimal parameter expansion tailored to task complexity. Furthermore, we present a Probabilistic Task Locator that assigns each task a dedicated, lightweight router. To handle the practical issue that task labels are unknown during inference, we leverage a VAE-based reconstruction strategy to identify the most suitable router by matching input distributions, allowing automatic and accurate expert allocation. This design mitigates routing conflicts and catastrophic forgetting, enabling robust continual learning without explicit task labels. Extensive experiments on the CoIN benchmark, covering eight diverse VQA tasks, demonstrate that LLaVA-CMoE delivers strong continual learning performance with a compact model size, significantly reducing forgetting and parameter overhead compared to prior methods. These results showcase the effectiveness and scalability of our approach for parameter-efficient continual learning in large language models. Our code will be open-sourced soon.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, there are still gaps between theory and practice that prevent the smooth adaptation of CONGEST algorithms to these environments. In this paper, we focus on the memory restrictions that arise in real-world deployments. We introduce the $\mu$-CONGEST model where on top of the bandwidth restriction, the memory of nodes is also limited to $\mu$ words, in line with real-world systems. We provide fast algorithms of two main flavors. First, we observe that many algorithms in the CONGEST model are memory-intensive and do not work in $\mu$-CONGEST. A prime example of a family of algorithms that use large memory is clique-listing algorithms. We show that the memory issue that arises here cannot be resolved without incurring a cost in the round complexity, by establishing a lower bound on the round complexity of listing cliques in $\mu$-CONGEST. We introduce novel techniques to overcome these issues and generalize the algorithms to work within a given memory bound. Combined with our lower bound, these provide tight tradeoffs between the running time and memory of nodes. Second, we show that it is possible to efficiently simulate various families of streaming algorithms in $\mu$-CONGEST. These include fast simulations of $p$-pass algorithms, random order streams, and various types of mergeable streaming algorithms. Combining our contributions, we show that we can use streaming algorithms to efficiently generate statistics regarding combinatorial structures in the network. An example of an end result of this type is that we can efficiently identify and provide the per-color frequencies of the frequent monochromatic triangles in $\mu$-CONGEST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 37th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA '25). 22 pages</p></details> |

Solving Stein equations has emerged as a possible alternative, providing a framework for numerical approximation of posterior expectations in which smoothness can be exploited. However, existing numerical methods for Stein equations are associated with high computational cost due to the need to solve large linear systems.

Traditional NLP approaches often struggle with identifying complex, implicit causal links, especially in low-data scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by transforming annotated news headlines into structured causal knowledge graphs. It then employs a hybrid retrieval system that merges semantic embeddings with graph-based structural cues leveraging Neo4j to accurately match and retrieve relevant events. The framework is built on a three-stage pipeline: First, during Data Preparation, news sentences are meticulously annotated and converted into causal graphs capturing cause, effect, and trigger relationships. Next, the Graph Retrieval stage stores these graphs along with their embeddings in a Neo4j database and utilizes hybrid Cypher queries to efficiently identify events that share both semantic and structural similarities with a given query. Finally, the LLM Inference stage utilizes these retrieved causal graphs in a few-shot learning setup with XML-based prompting, enabling robust classification and tagging of causal relationships. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that GraphRAG-Causal achieves an impressive F1-score of 82.1% on causal classification using just 20 few-shot examples. This approach significantly boosts accuracy and consistency, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in news reliability assessment, misinformation detection, and policy analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Previous work utilizing retrieved content by simply prepending it to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV) cache efficiently. In this paper, we propose FlashBack, a modular RALM designed to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern while maintaining decent performance after fine-tuning by Low-Rank Adaption. FlashBack appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently utilizing the KV cache instead of prepending them. And we introduce Marking Token as two special prompt tokens for marking the boundary of the appending context during fine-tuning. Our experiments on testing generation quality show that FlashBack can remain decent generation quality in perplexity. And the inference speed of FlashBack is up to $4\times$ faster than the prepending counterpart on a 7B LLM (Llama 2) in the runtime test. Via bypassing unnecessary re-computation, it demonstrates an advancement by achieving significantly faster inference speed, and this heightened efficiency will substantially reduce inferential cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Findings, 14 pages</p></details> |

Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately 6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

As video frame rates continue to increase, the diminishing inter-frame differences further expose the limitations of traditional frame-to-frame information exploitation methods, which are inadequate for addressing current video super-resolution (VSR) demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient and scalable solution inspired by the structural and statistical similarities between hyperspectral images (HSI) and video data. Our approach introduces a compression-driven dimensionality reduction strategy that reduces computational complexity, accelerates inference, and enhances the extraction of temporal information across frames. The proposed modular architecture is designed for seamless integration with existing VSR frameworks, ensuring strong adaptability and transferability across diverse applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance on par with, or surpassing, the current SOTA models, while significantly reducing inference time.

Nevertheless, current PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization.

Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However, real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

Despite its empirical success, the mechanism behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret, improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation (KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 ma...</summary><p>10 main pages, 10 page appendix</p></details> |

We introduce BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs. To tackle outliers in attention and feed-forward network activations, we propose H-BitLinear, a module applying an online Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization. This transformation smooths sharp activation distributions into more Gaussian-like forms, suitable for low-bit representation. Experiments show BitNet v2 trained from scratch with 8-bit activations matches BitNet b1.58 performance. Crucially, BitNet v2 achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost for batched inference.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Unlike traditional mediation measures, such as the natural indirect effect, the PIIE holds particular relevance in observational studies involving unethical exposures, when hypothetical interventions that impose harmful exposures are inappropriate. Although prior research has identified PIIE under unmeasured confounders between exposure and outcome, it has not fully addressed the confounding that affects the mediator. This paper proposes a novel PIIE identification framework in settings where unmeasured confounders influence exposure-outcome, exposure-mediator, and mediator-outcome relationships. Specifically, we leverage observed covariates as proxy variables for unmeasured confounders, constructing three proximal identification strategies. Additionally, we characterize the semiparametric efficiency bound and develop multiply robust and locally efficient estimators. To handle high-dimensional nuisance parameters, we propose a debiased machine learning approach that achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality to estimate the true PIIE values, even when the machine learning estimators for the nuisance functions do not converge at $\sqrt{n}$-rate. In simulations, our estimators demonstrate higher confidence interval coverage rates than conventional methods across various model misspecifications. In a real data application, our approaches reveal an indirect effect of alcohol consumption on depression risk mediated by depersonalization symptoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>61 pa...</summary><p>61 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Fast Bayesian Optimization of Function Networks with Partial Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11456v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks, where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead: choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over the original p-KGFN algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient Speech-Text Jointly Decoding within One Speech Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04518v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our company need to do internal review</p></details> |
| **[Transferable Post-training via Inverse Value Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21027v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As post-training processes utilize increasingly large datasets and base models continue to grow in size, the computational demands and implementation challenges of existing algorithms are escalating significantly. In this paper, we propose modeling the changes at the logits level during post-training using a separate neural network (i.e., the value network). After training this network on a small base model using demonstrations, this network can be seamlessly integrated with other pre-trained models during inference, enables them to achieve similar capability enhancements. We systematically investigate the best practices for this paradigm in terms of pre-training weights and connection schemes. We demonstrate that the resulting value network has broad transferability across pre-trained models of different parameter sizes within the same family, models undergoing continuous pre-training within the same family, and models with different vocabularies across families. In certain cases, it can achieve performance comparable to full-parameter fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore methods to enhance the transferability of the value model and prevent overfitting to the base model used during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[DPUV4E: High-Throughput DPU Architecture Design for CNN on Versal ACAP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11441v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain prevalent in computer vision applications, and FPGAs, known for their flexibility and energy efficiency, have become essential components in heterogeneous acceleration systems. However, traditional FPGAs face challenges in balancing performance and versatility due to limited on-chip resources. AMD's Versal ACAP architecture, tailored for AI applications, incorporates AI Engines (AIEs) to deliver high computational power. Nevertheless, the platform suffers from insufficient memory bandwidth, hindering the full utilization of the AIEs' theoretical performance. In this paper, we present DPUV4E for the Versal architecture, providing configurations ranging from 2PE ($32.6$ TOPS) to 8PE ($131.0$ TOPS). We design two computation units, Conv PE and DWC PE, to support different computational patterns. Each computation unit's data flow efficiently utilizes the data reuse opportunities to mitigate bandwidth bottlenecks. Additionally, we extend the functionality of each PE to utilize AIEs for non-convolutional operations, reducing resource overhead. Experiments on over 50 models show that compared to previous designs, our design provides $8.6\times$ the TOPS/W of traditional FPGA-based DPU designs, while reducing DSP usage by $95.8\%$, LUT usage by $44.7\%$, and latency to $68.5\%$ under single-batch conditions. For end-to-end inference, our design improving throughput by up to $2.2\times$ for depth-wise convolution models and up to $1.3\times$ for standard models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

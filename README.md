| **[VideoITG: Multimodal Video Understanding with Instructed Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13353v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Hierarchical Rectified Flow Matching with Mini-Batch Couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13350v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has emerged as a compelling generative modeling approach that is widely used across domains. To generate data via a flow matching model, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is numerically solved via forward integration of the modeled velocity field. To better capture the multi-modality that is inherent in typical velocity fields, hierarchical flow matching was recently introduced. It uses a hierarchy of ODEs that are numerically integrated when generating data. This hierarchy of ODEs captures the multi-modal velocity distribution just like vanilla flow matching is capable of modeling a multi-modal data distribution. While this hierarchy enables to model multi-modal velocity distributions, the complexity of the modeled distribution remains identical across levels of the hierarchy. In this paper, we study how to gradually adjust the complexity of the distributions across different levels of the hierarchy via mini-batch couplings. We show the benefits of mini-batch couplings in hierarchical rectified flow matching via compelling results on synthetic and imaging data.

| **[VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13348v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink</p></details> |
| **[$Ï€^3$: Scalable Permutation-Equivariant Visual Geometry Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13347v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce $\pi^3$, a feed-forward neural network that offers a novel approach to visual geometry reconstruction, breaking the reliance on a conventional fixed reference view. Previous methods often anchor their reconstructions to a designated viewpoint, an inductive bias that can lead to instability and failures if the reference is suboptimal. In contrast, $\pi^3$ employs a fully permutation-equivariant architecture to predict affine-invariant camera poses and scale-invariant local point maps without any reference frames. This design makes our model inherently robust to input ordering and highly scalable. These advantages enable our simple and bias-free approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including camera pose estimation, monocular/video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction. Code and models are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yyfz.github.io/pi3/</p></details> |
| **[Imbalance in Balance: Online Concept Balancing in Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13345v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and yields highly competitive results with only a few codes.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[AutoPartGen: Autogressive 3D Part Generation and Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13346v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoPartGen, a model that generates objects composed of 3D parts in an autoregressive manner. This model can take as input an image of an object, 2D masks of the object's parts, or an existing 3D object, and generate a corresponding compositional 3D reconstruction. Our approach builds upon 3DShape2VecSet, a recent latent 3D representation with powerful geometric expressiveness. We observe that this latent space exhibits strong compositional properties, making it particularly well-suited for part-based generation tasks. Specifically, AutoPartGen generates object parts autoregressively, predicting one part at a time while conditioning on previously generated parts and additional inputs, such as 2D images, masks, or 3D objects. This process continues until the model decides that all parts have been generated, thus determining automatically the type and number of parts. The resulting parts can be seamlessly assembled into coherent objects or scenes without requiring additional optimization. We evaluate both the overall 3D generation capabilities and the part-level generation quality of AutoPartGen, demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D part generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://silent-chen.github.io/AutoPartGen/</p></details> |
| **[Diffuman4D: 4D Consistent Human View Synthesis from Sparse-View Videos with Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13344v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of high-fidelity view synthesis of humans with sparse-view videos as input. Previous methods solve the issue of insufficient observation by leveraging 4D diffusion models to generate videos at novel viewpoints. However, the generated videos from these models often lack spatio-temporal consistency, thus degrading view synthesis quality. In this paper, we propose a novel sliding iterative denoising process to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency of the 4D diffusion model. Specifically, we define a latent grid in which each latent encodes the image, camera pose, and human pose for a certain viewpoint and timestamp, then alternately denoising the latent grid along spatial and temporal dimensions with a sliding window, and finally decode the videos at target viewpoints from the corresponding denoised latents. Through the iterative sliding, information flows sufficiently across the latent grid, allowing the diffusion model to obtain a large receptive field and thus enhance the 4D consistency of the output, while making the GPU memory consumption affordable. The experiments on the DNA-Rendering and ActorsHQ datasets demonstrate that our method is able to synthesize high-quality and consistent novel-view videos and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

| **[Taming Diffusion Transformer for Real-Time Mobile Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13343v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have shown strong performance in video generation tasks, but their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained devices like smartphones, and real-time generation is even more challenging. In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on mobile devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Utility-Scale Quantum Computation of Ground-State Energy in a 100+ Site Planar Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06361v3)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present experimental quantum computation of the ground-state energy in a 103-site flat Kagome lattice under the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), with IBM's Heron r1 and Heron r2 quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our per-site ground-state energy estimate is $-0.417\,J$, which, under open-boundary corrections, matches the energy in the thermodynamic limit, i.e., $-0.4386\,J$. To achieve this, we used a hybrid approach that splits the conventional Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for efficient hardware utilization. More importantly, we introduce a Hamiltonian engineering strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining computational accuracy. Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103 qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue. This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger lattices on utility quantum processors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Natio...</summary><p>National Center for Quantum Computing, UET Lahore, Pakistan</p></details> |
| **[SGCL: Unifying Self-Supervised and Supervised Learning for Graph Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13336v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) are essential for online platforms, providing personalized suggestions to users within a vast sea of information. Self-supervised graph learning seeks to harness high-order collaborative filtering signals through unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite graph, primarily leveraging a multi-task learning framework that includes both supervised recommendation loss and self-supervised contrastive loss. However, this separate design introduces additional graph convolution processes and creates inconsistencies in gradient directions due to disparate losses, resulting in prolonged training times and sub-optimal performance. In this study, we introduce a unified framework of Supervised Graph Contrastive Learning for recommendation (SGCL) to address these issues. SGCL uniquely combines the training of recommendation and unsupervised contrastive losses into a cohesive supervised contrastive learning loss, aligning both tasks within a single optimization direction for exceptionally fast training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in RecSys 2025. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2404.15954</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Context Engineering for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13334v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined by the contextual information provided during inference. This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research. Ultimately, this survey provides a unified framework for both researchers and engineers advancing context-aware AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ongoi...</summary><p>ongoing work; 165 pages, 1401 citations</p></details> |
| **[A Real-Time System for Egocentric Hand-Object Interaction Detection in Industrial Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13326v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-object interaction detection remains an open challenge in real-time applications, where intuitive user experiences depend on fast and accurate detection of interactions with surrounding objects. We propose an efficient approach for detecting hand-objects interactions from streaming egocentric vision that operates in real time. Our approach consists of an action recognition module and an object detection module for identifying active objects upon confirmed interaction. Our Mamba model with EfficientNetV2 as backbone for action recognition achieves 38.52% p-AP on the ENIGMA-51 benchmark at 30fps, while our fine-tuned YOLOWorld reaches 85.13% AP for hand and object. We implement our models in a cascaded architecture where the action recognition and object detection modules operate sequentially. When the action recognition predicts a contact state, it activates the object detection module, which in turn performs inference on the relevant frame to detect and classify the active object.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, In International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing</p></details> |
| **[GeoReg: Weight-Constrained Few-Shot Regression for Socio-Economic Estimation using LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13323v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Socio-economic indicators like regional GDP, population, and education levels, are crucial to shaping policy decisions and fostering sustainable development. This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant. These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with limited data availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Reliability in the Reasoning-based Pose Estimation Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13314v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT) annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented as a poster at MMFM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bidirectional Age of Incorrect Information: A Performance Metric for Status Updates in Virtual Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13312v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual dynamic environments (VDEs) such as the Metaverse and digital twins (DTs) require proper representation of the interacting entities to map their characteristics within the simulated or augmented space. Keeping these representations accurate and up-to-date is crucial for seamless interaction and system reliability. In this paper, we propose bidirectional age of incorrect information (BAoII) to address this aspect. BAoII quantifies the time-dependent penalty paid by an entity in a VDE due to incorrect or outdated knowledge about itself and the overall dynamically changing space. This extends the concept of age of incorrect information for a bidirectional information exchange, capturing that a VDE requires mutual awareness of the entity's own representation, measured in the virtual space, and what the other entities share about their representations. Using a continuous-time Markov chain model, we derive a closed-form expression for long-term BAoII and identify a transmission cost threshold for optimal update strategies. We describe a trade-off between communication cost and information freshness and validate our model through numerical simulations, demonstrating the impact of BAoII on evaluating system performance and highlighting its relevance for real-time collaboration in the Metaverse and DTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, Proc.

Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with comprehensive kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code changes. Focusing on performance-critical LLM kernels, we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.</p></details> | <details><summary>revis...</summary><p>revision after reviewers feedback, broadening autotune study</p></details> |

However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Ego Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data.

| **[Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</p></details> | 44 pages, 33 figures |
| **[Learning from Reward-Free Offline Data: A Case for Planning with Latent Dynamics Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14819v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-standing goal in AI is to build agents that can solve a variety of tasks across different environments, including previously unseen ones. Two dominant approaches tackle this challenge: (i) reinforcement learning (RL), which learns policies through trial and error, and (ii) optimal control, which plans actions using a learned or known dynamics model. However, their relative strengths and weaknesses remain underexplored in the setting where agents must learn from offline trajectories without reward annotations. In this work, we systematically analyze the performance of different RL and control-based methods under datasets of varying quality. On the RL side, we consider goal-conditioned and zero-shot approaches. On the control side, we train a latent dynamics model using the Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and use it for planning. We study how dataset properties-such as data diversity, trajectory quality, and environment variability-affect the performance of these approaches. Our results show that model-free RL excels when abundant, high-quality data is available, while model-based planning excels in generalization to novel environment layouts, trajectory stitching, and data-efficiency. Notably, planning with a latent dynamics model emerges as a promising approach for zero-shot generalization from suboptimal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project web page: https://latent-planning.github.io/</p></details> |

Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper 12 pages, Appendix 7 pages, 1 figure, 18 tables</p></details> |

These models achieve substantial performance improvements at reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral. The experimental results validate HC-SMoE's superior performance and practical applicability for real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/wazenmai/HC-SMoE</p></details> |

AbGen consists of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs. Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[SIDDA: SInkhorn Dynamic Domain Adaptation for Image Classification with Equivariant Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14048v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables. code available at: https://github.com/deepskies/SIDDA</p></details> |

Since these labels are subject to noise, various approaches to learning from crowds have been proposed. Typically, these approaches are evaluated with default hyperparameter configurations, resulting in unfair and suboptimal performance, or with hyperparameter configurations tuned via a validation set with ground truth class labels, representing an often unrealistic scenario. Moreover, both setups can produce different approach rankings, complicating study comparisons. Therefore, we introduce crowd-hpo as a framework for evaluating approaches to learning from crowds in combination with criteria to select well-performing hyperparameter configurations with access only to noisy crowd-labeled validation data. Extensive experiments with neural networks demonstrate that these criteria select hyperparameter configurations, which improve the learning from crowd approaches' generalization performances, measured on separate test sets with ground truth labels. Hence, incorporating such criteria into experimental studies is essential for enabling fairer and more realistic benchmarking.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing methods often produce presentations with logical inconsistencies and suboptimal layouts, thereby struggling to meet professional standards. To address these challenges, we introduce RCPS (Reflective Coherent Presentation Synthesis), a novel framework integrating three key components: (1) Deep Structured Narrative Planning; (2) Adaptive Layout Generation; (3) an Iterative Optimization Loop. Additionally, we propose PREVAL, a preference-based evaluation framework employing rationale-enhanced multi-dimensional models to assess presentation quality across Content, Coherence, and Design. Experimental results demonstrate that RCPS significantly outperforms baseline methods across all quality dimensions, producing presentations that closely approximate human expert standards. PREVAL shows strong correlation with human judgments, validating it as a reliable automated tool for assessing presentation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

By leveraging relevant properties of this class of games, we show that equilibria of the original seemingly infinite-dimensional problem can be obtained as a solution to a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We then reformulate the problem as a finite-dimensional variational inequality and establish the connection between the corresponding solution sets. Our reformulation has scalable behaviour with respect to the data size and maintains a fixed number of constraints, independently of the number of samples. To compute a solution, we leverage two algorithms, based on the golden ratio algorithm. The efficiency of both algorithmic schemes is corroborated through extensive simulation studies on an illustrative example and a stochastic portfolio allocation game, where behavioural coupling among investors is modeled.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

However, the existing open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information. Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training, instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue. In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of 2%-4% in available rate over baselines.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to CoRL 2025</p></details> |

This hampers real-world applicability in scenarios where current-year labels are unavailable. In addition, uncertainty quantification is often overlooked, which reduces the reliability of such approaches for operational crop monitoring. Inspired by ecophysiological principles of plant growth, we propose a simple, model-agnostic Thermal-Time-based Temporal Sampling (T3S) method that replaces calendar time with thermal time. By subsampling time series in this biologically meaningful way, our method highlights key periods within the growing season while reducing temporal redundancy and noise. We evaluate the T3S on a multi-year Sentinel-2 dataset covering the entirety of Switzerland, which allows us to assess all applied methods on unseen years. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our approach yields substantial improvements in classification accuracy and, critically, provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Moreover, the T3S method excels in low-data regimes and enables significantly more accurate early-season classification. With just 10% of the training labels, it outperforms the current baseline in both accuracy and uncertainty calibration, and by the end of June, it achieves a performance similar to the full-season baseline model.</p></details> | under review |

However, recent studies questions its effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%) on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity. The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line, which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation space.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to AAAI-26</p></details> |

These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Worki...</summary><p>Working in progress. 22 pages (8+ for main); 25 figures; 1 table</p></details> |

While data-driven techniques have shown considerable prowess in achieving high forecast accuracy in recent years, they rely heavily on the quality of input covariates. In this paper, we investigate whether asynchronously published prices as a result of differing gate closure times (GCTs) in some bidding zones can improve forecasting accuracy in other markets with later GCTs. Using a state-of-the-art ensemble of models, we show significant improvements of 22% and 9% in forecast accuracy in the Belgian (BE) and Swedish bidding zones (SE3) respectively, when including price data from interconnected markets with earlier GCT (Germany-Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland). This improvement holds for both general as well as extreme market conditions. Our analysis also yields further important insights: frequent model recalibration is necessary for maximum accuracy but comes at substantial additional computational costs, and using data from more markets does not always lead to better performance - a fact we delve deeper into with interpretability analysis of the forecast models. Overall, these findings provide valuable guidance for market participants and decision-makers aiming to optimize bidding strategies within increasingly interconnected and volatile European energy markets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Both ...</summary><p>Both Maria Margarida Mascarenhas and Jilles De Blauwe contributed equally to the paper</p></details> |

However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method.

In this work, we propose a series of novel optimizations to significantly accelerate video generation and enable real-time performance on mobile platforms. First, we employ a highly compressed variational autoencoder (VAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the input data without sacrificing visual quality. Second, we introduce a KD-guided, sensitivity-aware tri-level pruning strategy to shrink the model size to suit mobile platform while preserving critical performance characteristics. Third, we develop an adversarial step distillation technique tailored for DiT, which allows us to reduce the number of inference steps to four. Combined, these optimizations enable our model to achieve over 10 frames per second (FPS) generation on an iPhone 16 Pro Max, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time, high-quality video generation on mobile devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This research introduces GeoReg a regression model that integrates diverse data sources, including satellite imagery and web-based geospatial information, to estimate these indicators even for data-scarce regions such as developing countries. Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large language model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM functioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable effective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains contextual relationships between data features and the target indicator, categorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant. These features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight constraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also identifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with nonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different stages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in estimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with limited data availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</p></details> | 44 pages, 33 figures |

Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, ICCV accepted paper</p></details> |

Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU.

| **[Task-Circuit Quantization: Leveraging Knowledge Localization and Interpretability for Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07389v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025 Camera Ready.

Our solution broadly consists of generalizing suffix sorting and revisiting suffix tree path compression. In classic suffix trees, path compression works by replacing unary suffix trie paths with pairs of pointers to $T$, which must be available in the form of some random access oracle at query time. In our approach, instead, we (i) sort the suffix tree's leaves according to a more general priority function $\pi$ (generalizing suffix sorting), (ii) we build a suffix tree path decomposition prioritizing the leftmost paths in such an order, and (iii) we path-compress the decomposition's paths as pointers to a small subset of the string's suffixes. At this point, we show that the colexicographically-sorted array of those pointers represents a new elegant, simple, and remarkably I/O-efficient compressed suffix tree. For instance, by taking $\pi$ to be the lexicographic rank of $T$'s suffixes, we can compress the suffix tree topology in $O(r)$ space on top of a $n\log\sigma + O(\log n)$-bits text representation while essentially matching the pattern matching I/O complexity of Weiner and McCreight's suffix tree. Another (more practical) solution is obtained by taking $\pi$ to be the colexicographic rank of $T$'s prefixes and using a fully-compressed random access oracle. The resulting self-index allows us to locate all occurrences of a given query pattern in less space and orders of magnitude faster than the $r$-index.</p></details> | Submitted version |

The absence of ground truths for unknown objects makes OWOD tasks particularly challenging. Many methods have addressed this by using pseudo-labels for unknown objects. The recently proposed Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector (PROB) is a state-of-the-art model that does not require pseudo-labels for unknown objects, as it predicts probabilistic objectness. However, this method faces issues with learning conflicts between objectness and class predictions. To address this issue and further enhance performance, we propose a novel model, Decoupled PROB. Decoupled PROB introduces Early Termination of Objectness Prediction (ETOP) to stop objectness predictions at appropriate layers in the decoder, resolving the learning conflicts between class and objectness predictions in PROB. Additionally, we introduce Task-Decoupled Query Initialization (TDQI), which efficiently extracts features of known and unknown objects, thereby improving performance. TDQI is a query initialization method that combines query selection and learnable queries, and it is a module that can be easily integrated into existing DETR-based OWOD models. Extensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks demonstrate that Decoupled PROB surpasses all existing methods across several metrics, significantly improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to WACV 2025 (Tucson, Arizona, USA), February 28-March 4 2025</p></details> |

Among the existing NAS approaches, Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained prominence for its efficiency and ease of use, inspiring numerous advancements. Since the rise of Vision Transformers (ViT), researchers have applied NAS to explore ViT architectures, often focusing on macro-level search spaces and relying on discrete methods like evolutionary algorithms. While these methods ensure reliability, they face challenges in discovering innovative architectural designs, demand extensive computational resources, and are time-intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce Differentiable Architecture Search for Vision Transformer (DASViT), which bridges the gap in differentiable search for ViTs and uncovers novel designs.

| **[The Power of Architecture: Deep Dive into Transformer Architectures for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13043v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However, existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself. To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs, enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models, reinforcing the validity of our conclusions.

However, their latency, high computational costs and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment, especially on resource-constrained hardware. While structured pruning methods can reduce these factors, they often require costly retraining, sometimes for up to hundreds of epochs, or even training from scratch to recover the lost accuracy resulting from the structural modifications. Maintaining the provided performance of trained models after structured pruning and thereby avoiding extensive retraining remains a challenge. To solve this, we introduce Variance-Based Pruning, a simple and structured one-shot pruning technique for efficiently compressing networks, with minimal finetuning. Our approach first gathers activation statistics, which are used to select neurons for pruning. Simultaneously the mean activations are integrated back into the model to preserve a high degree of performance. On ImageNet-1k recognition tasks, we demonstrate that directly after pruning DeiT-Base retains over 70% of its original performance and requires only 10 epochs of fine-tuning to regain 99% of the original accuracy while simultaneously reducing MACs by 35% and model size by 36%, thus speeding up the model by 1.44x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025</p></details> |

The efficiency of NTT computation directly impacts the overall performance of FHE, making hardware acceleration a critical technology that will enable realistic FHE applications. Custom accelerators, in FPGAs or ASICs, offer significant performance advantages due to their ability to exploit massive parallelism and specialized optimizations. However, the operation of NTT over large moduli requires large word-length modulo arithmetic that limits achievable clock frequencies in hardware and increases hardware area costs. To overcome such deficits, digit-serial arithmetic has been explored for modular multiplication and addition independently. The goal of this work is to leverage digit-serial modulo arithmetic combined with appropriate redundant data representation to design modular pipelined NTT accelerators that operate uniformly on arbitrary small digits, without the need for intermediate (de)serialization. The proposed architecture enables high clock frequencies through regular pipelining while maintaining parallelism. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art implementations and reduces hardware complexity under equal performance and input-output bandwidth constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>28th ...</summary><p>28th Euromicro Conference Series on Digital System Design (DSD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[FantasyPortrait: Enhancing Multi-Character Portrait Animation with Expression-Augmented Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12956v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing expressive facial animations from static images is a challenging task. Prior methods relying on explicit geometric priors (e.g., facial landmarks or 3DMM) often suffer from artifacts in cross reenactment and struggle to capture subtle emotions. Furthermore, existing approaches lack support for multi-character animation, as driving features from different individuals frequently interfere with one another, complicating the task. To address these challenges, we propose FantasyPortrait, a diffusion transformer based framework capable of generating high-fidelity and emotion-rich animations for both single- and multi-character scenarios. Our method introduces an expression-augmented learning strategy that utilizes implicit representations to capture identity-agnostic facial dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to render fine-grained emotions. For multi-character control, we design a masked cross-attention mechanism that ensures independent yet coordinated expression generation, effectively preventing feature interference. To advance research in this area, we propose the Multi-Expr dataset and ExprBench, which are specifically designed datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating multi-character portrait animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FantasyPortrait significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, excelling particularly in challenging cross reenactment and multi-character contexts.

While prior efforts -- such as sparse attention and temporally autoregressive models -- offer partial relief, they often compromise temporal coherence or scalability. We introduce LoViC, a DiT-based framework trained on million-scale open-domain videos, designed to produce long, coherent videos through a segment-wise generation process. At the core of our approach is FlexFormer, an expressive autoencoder that jointly compresses video and text into unified latent representations. It supports variable-length inputs with linearly adjustable compression rates, enabled by a single query token design based on the Q-Former architecture. Additionally, by encoding temporal context through position-aware mechanisms, our model seamlessly supports prediction, retradiction, interpolation, and multi-shot generation within a unified paradigm. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks validate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiangjiaxiu.github.io/lovic/</p></details> |

Mechanistic interpretability, particularly through the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs), offers a promising approach for uncovering human-interpretable features within large transformer-based models. In this study, we apply Matryoshka-SAE to the radiology-specialised multimodal large language model, MAIRA-2, to interpret its internal representations. Using large-scale automated interpretability of the SAE features, we identify a range of clinically relevant concepts - including medical devices (e.g., line and tube placements, pacemaker presence), pathologies such as pleural effusion and cardiomegaly, longitudinal changes and textual features. We further examine the influence of these features on model behaviour through steering, demonstrating directional control over generations with mixed success. Our results reveal practical and methodological challenges, yet they offer initial insights into the internal concepts learned by MAIRA-2 - marking a step toward deeper mechanistic understanding and interpretability of a radiology-adapted multimodal large language model, and paving the way for improved model transparency. We release the trained SAEs and interpretations: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/maira-2-sae.</p></details> | <details><summary>Actio...</summary><p>Actionable Interpretability Workshop at ICML 2025. 24 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Although Transformer-based forecasting models have demonstrated remarkable success in general tasks, their computational efficiency often falls short of the stringent requirements in large-scale cloud environments. Given that most workload series exhibit complicated periodic patterns, addressing these challenges in the frequency domain offers substantial advantages. To this end, we propose Fremer, an efficient and effective deep forecasting model. Fremer fulfills three critical requirements: it demonstrates superior efficiency, outperforming most Transformer-based forecasting models; it achieves exceptional accuracy, surpassing all state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in workload forecasting; and it exhibits robust performance for multi-period series. Furthermore, we collect and open-source four high-quality, open-source workload datasets derived from ByteDance's cloud services, encompassing workload data from thousands of computing instances. Extensive experiments on both our proprietary datasets and public benchmarks demonstrate that Fremer consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving average improvements of 5.5% in MSE, 4.7% in MAE, and 8.6% in SMAPE over SOTA models, while simultaneously reducing parameter scale and computational costs. Additionally, in a proactive auto-scaling test based on Kubernetes, Fremer improves average latency by 18.78% and reduces resource consumption by 2.35%, underscoring its practical efficacy in real-world applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Therefore designing optimally informative experiments for arbitrary initial parameters often yields highly nonlinear optimization problems and makes optimal design infeasible. To overcome such challenges, we connect design theory for discrete choice experiments with Laplacian matrices of undirected graphs, resulting in complexity reduction and feasibility of optimal design. We rewrite the $D$-optimality criterion in terms of Laplacians via Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem, and show that its dual has a simple description via the Cayley-Menger determinant of the Farris transform of the Laplacian matrix. This results in a drastic reduction of complexity and allows us to implement a gradient descent algorithm to find locally $D$-optimal designs. For the subclass of Bradley-Terry paired comparison models, we find a direct link to maximum likelihood estimation for Laplacian-constrained Gaussian graphical models. Finally, we study the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its application to real and simulated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3: 2...</summary><p>v3: 24 pages including appendix.

However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication in Chaos, May 2025</p></details> |
| **[A 1/2-Approximation for Budgeted $k$-Submodular Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12875v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A $k$-submodular function naturally generalizes submodular functions by taking as input $k$ disjoint subsets, rather than a single subset. Unlike standard submodular maximization, which only requires selecting elements for the solution, $k$-submodular maximization adds the challenge of determining the subset to which each selected element belongs. Prior research has shown that the greedy algorithm is a 1/2-approximation for the monotone $k$-submodular maximization problem under cardinality or matroid constraints. However, whether a firm 1/2-approximation exists for the budgeted version (i.e., with a knapsack constraint) has remained open for several years. We resolve this question affirmatively by proving that the 1-Guess Greedy algorithm, which first guesses an appropriate element from an optimal solution before proceeding with the greedy algorithm, achieves a 1/2-approximation. This result is asymptotically tight as $((k+1)/(2k)+\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many value oracle queries even without constraints (Iwata et al., SODA 2016). We further show that 1-Guess Greedy is 1/3-approximation for the non-monotone problem. This algorithm is both simple and parallelizable, making it well-suited for practical applications. Using the thresholding technique from (Badanidiyuru and Vondrak, SODA 2014), it runs in nearly $\tilde O(n^2k^2)$ time. The proof idea is simple: we introduce a novel continuous transformation from an optimal solution to a greedy solution, using the multilinear extension to evaluate every fractional solution during the transformation. This continuous analysis approach yields two key extensions. First, it enables improved approximation ratios of various existing algorithms. Second, our method naturally extends to $k$-submodular maximization problems under broader constraints, offering a more flexible and unified analysis framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.

The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation.

We benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15 real-world datasets with different species and data sizes.

While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue.

We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

Self-supervised graph learning seeks to harness high-order collaborative filtering signals through unsupervised augmentation on the user-item bipartite graph, primarily leveraging a multi-task learning framework that includes both supervised recommendation loss and self-supervised contrastive loss.

This survey introduces Context Engineering, a formal discipline that transcends simple prompt design to encompass the systematic optimization of information payloads for LLMs. We present a comprehensive taxonomy decomposing Context Engineering into its foundational components and the sophisticated implementations that integrate them into intelligent systems. We first examine the foundational components: context retrieval and generation, context processing and context management. We then explore how these components are architecturally integrated to create sophisticated system implementations: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), memory systems and tool-integrated reasoning, and multi-agent systems. Through this systematic analysis of over 1300 research papers, our survey not only establishes a technical roadmap for the field but also reveals a critical research gap: a fundamental asymmetry exists between model capabilities. While current models, augmented by advanced context engineering, demonstrate remarkable proficiency in understanding complex contexts, they exhibit pronounced limitations in generating equally sophisticated, long-form outputs. Addressing this gap is a defining priority for future research.

These models achieve substantial performance improvements at reduced inference costs. However, the deployment of SMoE models faces constraints from extensive memory requirements of expert components in resource-limited environments. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Hierarchical Clustering for Sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (HC-SMoE), a task-agnostic expert merging framework for parameter reduction without retraining. HC-SMoE introduces a novel hierarchical clustering approach based on expert outputs to ensure merging robustness independent of routing decisions. The proposed output-based clustering method enables effective capture of functional relationships between experts for large-scale architectures. We provide theoretical analysis and comprehensive evaluations across multiple zero-shot language tasks to demonstrate HC-SMoE's effectiveness in state-of-the-art models including Qwen and Mixtral.

However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, Submitted to CoRL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13255v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Worki...</summary><p>Working in progress. 22 pages (8+ for main); 25 figures; 1 table</p></details> |
| **[VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13231v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions (e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target, up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and 2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ucd-dare.github.io/VITA/</p></details> |

Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation.

Yet, the crucial task of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation. Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for adaptable foundation imputation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10th ...</summary><p>10th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD), ECML 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Scenario-Profiled Indexing with Knowledge Expansion (SPIKE), a dense retrieval framework that explicitly indexes implicit relevance by decomposing documents into scenario-based retrieval units. SPIKE organizes documents into scenario, which encapsulates the reasoning process necessary to uncover implicit relationships between hypothetical information needs and document content. SPIKE constructs a scenario-augmented dataset using a powerful teacher large language model (LLM), then distills these reasoning capabilities into a smaller, efficient scenario generator. During inference, SPIKE incorporates scenario-level relevance alongside document-level relevance, enabling reasoning-aware retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPIKE consistently enhances retrieval performance across various query types and dense retrievers. It also enhances the retrieval experience for users through scenario and offers valuable contextual information for LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

In previous editions of the BraTS Local Synthesis of Healthy Brain Tissue via Inpainting Challenge, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) demonstrated qualitatively convincing results but suffered from low sampling speed. To mitigate this limitation, we adapted a 2D image generation approach, combining DDPMs with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and employing a variance-preserving noise schedule, for the task of 3D inpainting. Our experiments showed that the variance-preserving noise schedule and the selected reconstruction losses can be effectively utilized for high-quality 3D inpainting in a few time steps without requiring adversarial training. We applied our findings to a different architecture, a 3D wavelet diffusion model (WDM3D) that does not include a GAN component. The resulting model, denoted as fastWDM3D, obtained a SSIM of 0.8571, a MSE of 0.0079, and a PSNR of 22.26 on the BraTS inpainting test set. Remarkably, it achieved these scores using only two time steps, completing the 3D inpainting process in 1.81 s per image. When compared to other DDPMs used for healthy brain tissue inpainting, our model is up to 800 x faster while still achieving superior performance metrics. Our proposed method, fastWDM3D, represents a promising approach for fast and accurate healthy tissue inpainting.

While grammar mining techniques have focused on recovering syntactic structures, the semantics of input processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for inferring attributed grammars from parser implementations. Given an input grammar, our technique dynamically analyzes the implementation of recursive descent parsers to reconstruct the semantic aspects of input handling, resulting in specifications in the form of attributed grammars. By observing program executions and mapping the program's runtime behavior to the grammar, we systematically extract and embed semantic actions into the grammar rules. This enables comprehensive specification recovery. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using an initial set of programs, showing that it can accurately reproduce program behavior through the generated attributed grammars.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSME 2025</p></details> |

A simple example of such a problem is the task of finding a locally optimal cut, i.e., a cut where for each node at least half of its incident edges are cut edges. The distributed round complexity of locally optimal cut has been wide open; the problem is known to require $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds in the deterministic LOCAL model and $\Omega(\log \log n)$ rounds in the randomized LOCAL model, but the only known upper bound is the trivial brute-force solution of $O(n)$ rounds. Locally optimal cut in bounded-degree graphs is perhaps the simplest example of a locally checkable labeling problem for which there is still such a large gap between current upper and lower bounds. We show that in bounded-degree graphs, all local potential problems, including locally optimal cut, can be solved in $\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds, both in the deterministic and randomized LOCAL models. In particular, the deterministic round complexity of the locally optimal cut problem is now settled to $\log^{\Theta(1)} n$.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figures.

However, MAR models have traditionally underperformed when compared to standard AR models. This study refines the MAR architecture to improve image generation quality. We begin by evaluating various image tokenizers to identify the most effective one. Subsequently, we introduce an improved Bidirectional LLaMA architecture by replacing causal attention with bidirectional attention and incorporating 2D RoPE, which together form our advanced model, MaskGIL. Scaled from 111M to 1.4B parameters, MaskGIL achieves a FID score of 3.71, matching state-of-the-art AR models in the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, while requiring only 8 inference steps compared to the 256 steps of AR models. Furthermore, we develop a text-driven MaskGIL model with 775M parameters for generating images from text at various resolutions. Beyond image generation, MaskGIL extends to accelerate AR-based generation and enable real-time speech-to-image conversion.

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets.

In such systems, perception relies on sensors such as cameras to capture environmental data, which is then processed by AI models to support decision-making. However, degradation in sensor performance directly impacts input data quality and can impair AI inference. Specifying safety requirements for all possible sensor degradation scenarios leads to unmanageable complexity and inevitable gaps. In this position paper, we present a novel framework that integrates camera noise factor identification with situation coverage analysis to systematically elicit robustness-related safety requirements for AI-based perception systems. We focus specifically on camera degradation in the automotive domain. Building on an existing framework for identifying degradation modes, we propose involving domain, sensor, and safety experts, and incorporating Operational Design Domain specifications to extend the degradation model by incorporating noise factors relevant to AI performance. Situation coverage analysis is then applied to identify representative operational contexts. This work marks an initial step toward integrating noise factor analysis and situational coverage to support principled formulation and completeness assessment of robustness requirements for camera-based AI perception.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |

The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units, reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$, $1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator.

In this framework, observations are thought to be drawn from a distribution over variables of interest, and the goal is to identify parameters of this distribution. Even though the stated goal is often to inform decision making on some target population, there is no straightforward way to include these target populations in the framework. Instead of modelling the relationship between the observed sample and the target population, the inductive assumptions in this framework take the form of abstract sampling and independence assumptions. In this paper, we develop a version of this framework that construes causal inference as treatment-wise predictions for finite populations where all assumptions are testable in retrospect; this means that one can not only test predictions themselves (without any fundamental problem) but also investigate sources of error when they fail. Due to close connections to the original framework, established methods can still be be analysed under the new framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Humans, Algorithmic Decision-Making and Society Workshop at ICML 2024</p></details> |

It is observed that the properties of Lasso vary wildly depending on the choice of the penalty parameter. The recent results of Lahiri (2021) suggest that, depending on the nature of the penalty parameter, Lasso can either be variable selection consistent or be $n^{1/2}-$consistent. However, practitioners generally implement Lasso by choosing the penalty parameter in a data-dependent way, the most popular being the $K$-fold cross-validation. In this paper, we explore the variable selection consistency and $n^{1/2}-$consistency of Lasso when the penalty is chosen based on $K$-fold cross-validation with $K$ being fixed. We consider the fixed-dimensional heteroscedastic linear regression model and show that Lasso with $K$-fold cross-validation based penalty is $n^{1/2}-$consistent, but not variable selection consistent. We also establish the $n^{1/2}-$consistency of the $K$-fold cross-validation based penalty as an intermediate result. Additionally, as a consequence of $n^{1/2}-$consistency, we establish the validity of Bootstrap to approximate the distribution of the Lasso estimator based on $K-$fold cross-validation. We validate the Bootstrap approximation in finite samples based on a moderate simulation study. Thus, our results essentially justify the use of $K$-fold cross-validation in practice to draw inferences based on $n^{1/2}-$scaled pivotal quantities in Lasso regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.19515</p></details> |

In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Local Representative Token Guided Merging for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12771v1)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image, but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time. We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Traditional physics-based stability metrics, such as Static Stability Margin (SSM) or Zero Moment Point (ZMP) require knowledge of contact forces, terrain geometry, and the robot's precise center-of-mass that are difficult to measure accurately in real-world field conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based approach to estimate robot platform stability directly from proprioceptive data using a lightweight neural network, IMUnet. Our method enables data-driven inference of robot stability without requiring an explicit terrain model or force sensing. We also develop a novel vision-based ArUco tracking method to compute a scalar score to quantify robot platform stability called C3 score. The score captures image-space perturbations over time as a proxy for physical instability and is used as a training signal for the neural network based model. As a pilot study, we evaluate our approach on data collected across multiple terrain types and speeds and demonstrate generalization to previously unseen conditions. These initial results highlight the potential of using IMU and robot velocity as inputs to estimate platform stability. The proposed method finds application in gating robot tasks such as precision actuation and sensing, especially for mobile manipulation tasks in agricultural and space applications. Our learning method also provides a supervision mechanism for perception based traversability estimation and planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Natha...</summary><p>Nathaniel Rose and Arif Ahmed contributed equally to this work.

This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI-25 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security (AICS)</p></details> |

This scenario poses a challenge in extracting and leveraging multi-scale features, which is often essential for precise inference. To address this challenge, we propose a new attention mechanism, named cascaded multi-scale attention (CMSA), tailored for use in CNN-ViT hybrid architectures, to handle low-resolution inputs effectively. The design of CMSA enables the extraction and seamless integration of features across various scales without necessitating the downsampling of the input image or feature maps. This is achieved through a novel combination of grouped multi-head self-attention mechanisms with window-based local attention and cascaded fusion of multi-scale features over different scales. This architecture allows for the effective handling of features across different scales, enhancing the model's ability to perform tasks such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in these areas with fewer parameters, showcasing its potential for broad application in real-world scenarios where capturing high-resolution images is not feasible.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR by facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained representations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from differences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a persistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced generalization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic bias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across domains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics of each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that item embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without collapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential level, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering source domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during target domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen domains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring target-domain interactions...</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Recsys'25 Spotlight Oral</p></details> |

Weighting a partition according to the spanning-tree metric has been of mathematical and practical interest because it typically favors partitions with more compact pieces. An appealing algorithm suggested by Charikar et al. is to sample a random spanning tree and remove k-1 edges, producing a random forest. If the components of the forest form a balanced partition, the partition is equitable under an easily computed acceptance probability. Cannon et al. recently showed that spanning trees on grid graphs and grid-like graphs on $n$ vertices are splittable into $k$ equal sized pieces with probability at least $n^{-2k}$, leading to the first rigorous sampling algorithm for a class of graphs. We present complementary results showing that spanning trees on dense random graphs also have inverse polynomial probability of being splittable, giving another class of graphs where equitable partitions can be efficiently sampled exactly. These proofs also guarantee fast almost-uniform sampling for the up-down walk on forests, giving another provably efficient randomized method for generating equitable partitions. Further, we show that problems with the well-studied ReCom algorithm for equitable partitioning are more extensive than previously known, even in special cases that were believed to be more promising. We present a family of graphs where the Markov chain fails to be irreducible when it must keep the components perfectly equitable; yet when the chain is allowed an imbalance of just one vertex between components, the rejection sampling step may take exponential time. This is true even when the graph satisfies desirable properties that have been conjectured to be sufficient for fast sampling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Variational Inference for Latent Variable Models in High Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01893v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational inference (VI) is a popular method for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian inference and probabilistic machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for quantifying the statistical accuracy of mean-field variational inference (MFVI) for posterior approximation in Bayesian latent variable models with categorical local latent variables (and arbitrary global latent variables). Utilizing our general framework, we capture the exact regime where MFVI 'works' for the celebrated latent Dirichlet allocation model. Focusing on the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel, we show that the vanilla fully factorized MFVI, often used in the literature, is suboptimal. We propose a partially grouped VI algorithm for this model and show that it works, and derive its exact finite-sample performance. We further illustrate that our bounds are tight for both the above models. Our proof techniques, which extend the framework of nonlinear large deviations, open the door for the analysis of MFVI in other latent variable models.</p></details> | 78 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Dynamic EventNeRF: Reconstructing General Dynamic Scenes from Multi-view RGB and Event Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06770v4)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volumetric reconstruction of dynamic scenes is an important problem in computer vision. It is especially challenging in poor lighting and with fast motion. This is partly due to limitations of RGB cameras: To capture frames under low lighting, the exposure time needs to be increased, which leads to more motion blur. In contrast, event cameras, which record changes in pixel brightness asynchronously, are much less dependent on lighting, making them more suitable for recording fast motion. We hence propose the first method to spatiotemporally reconstruct a scene from sparse multi-view event streams and sparse RGB frames. We train a sequence of cross-faded time-conditioned NeRF models, one per short recording segment. The individual segments are supervised with a set of event- and RGB-based losses and sparse-view regularisation. We assemble a real-world multi-view camera rig with six static event cameras around the object and record a benchmark multi-view event stream dataset of challenging motions. Our work outperforms RGB-based baselines, producing state-of-the-art results, and opens up the topic of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a new path for fast scene capture beyond RGB cameras. The code and the data are released at https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/DynEventNeRF/</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 13 figures, 7 tables; CVPRW 2025</p></details> |

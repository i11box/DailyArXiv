| **[Trokens: Semantic-Aware Relational Trajectory Tokens for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03695v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits), Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 28 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables; Project Page at https://lidarcrafter.github.io</p></details> |
| **[PAC Apprenticeship Learning with Bayesian Active Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03693v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at RLC 2025</p></details> |
| **[La La LiDAR: Large-Scale Layout Generation from LiDAR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03691v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Veila: Panoramic LiDAR Generation from a Monocular RGB Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03690v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially, complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion; and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency, while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 10 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We consider the extensive-width regime $r \asymp d^\beta$ for $\beta \in [0, 1)$, and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients $\lambda_j\asymp j^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.</p></details> | 84 pages |
| **[CompassVerifier: A Unified and Robust Verifier for LLMs Evaluation and Outcome Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03686v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer verification is crucial not only for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by matching their unstructured outputs against standard answers, but also serves as the reward model to guide LLM optimization. Most evaluation frameworks rely on regularized matching or employ general LLMs for answer verification, which demands extensive, repetitive customization for regex rules or evaluation prompts. Two fundamental limitations persist in current methodologies: 1) the absence of comprehensive benchmarks that systematically evaluate verification capabilities across different LLMs; and 2) the nascent stage of verifier development, where existing approaches lack both the robustness to handle complex edge cases and the generalizability across different domains. In this work, we develop CompassVerifier, an accurate and robust lightweight verifier model for evaluation and outcome reward. It demonstrates multi-domain competency spanning math, knowledge, and diverse reasoning tasks, with the capability to process various answer types, including multi-subproblems, formulas, and sequence answers, while effectively identifying abnormal/invalid responses. We introduce VerifierBench benchmark comprising model outputs collected from multiple data sources, augmented through manual analysis of metaerror patterns to enhance CompassVerifier. We anticipate that CompassVerifier and VerifierBench will facilitate answer verification, evaluation protocols, and reinforcement learning research. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/CompassVerifier.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; 31 Pages</p></details> |
| **[What If, But Privately: Private Counterfactual Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03681v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications. Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement. However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect, information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user, compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically, but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the database leakage of the proposed schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.13812, arXiv:2411.10429</p></details> |
| **[FairLangProc: A Python package for fairness in NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03677v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise in usage of Large Language Models to near ubiquitousness in recent years has risen societal concern about their applications in decision-making contexts, such as organizational justice or healthcare. This, in turn, poses questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and democratization of bias mitigation techniques. The implementation can be found on https://github.com/arturo-perez-peralta/FairLangProc.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Think Outside the Data: Colonial Biases and Systemic Issues in Automated Moderation Pipelines for Low-Resource Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13836v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most social media users come from the Global South, where harmful content usually appears in local languages. Yet, AI-driven moderation systems struggle with low-resource languages spoken in these regions. Through semi-structured interviews with 22 AI experts working on harmful content detection in four low-resource languages: Tamil (South Asia), Swahili (East Africa), Maghrebi Arabic (North Africa), and Quechua (South America)--we examine systemic issues in building automated moderation tools for these languages. Our findings reveal that beyond data scarcity, socio-political factors such as tech companies' monopoly on user data and lack of investment in moderation for low-profit Global South markets exacerbate historic inequities. Even if more data were available, the English-centric and data-intensive design of language models and preprocessing techniques overlooks the need to design for morphologically complex, linguistically diverse, and code-mixed languages. We argue these limitations are not just technical gaps caused by "data scarcity" but reflect structural inequities, rooted in colonial suppression of non-Western languages. We discuss multi-stakeholder approaches to strengthen local research capacity, democratize data access, and support language-aware solutions to improve automated moderation for low-resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIES 2025</p></details> |
| **[OmniShape: Zero-Shot Multi-Hypothesis Shape and Pose Estimation in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03669v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling performance on challenging real world datasets.

| **[A DbC Inspired Neurosymbolic Layer for Trustworthy Agent Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03665v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.</p></details> | 3 pages, 1 figure |

State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21055v5)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by modeling the temporal order of actions, but has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining unseen "What if" scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. We conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>89 pa...</summary><p>89 pages (37 main), 6+6 figures, 1 table.

| **[Efficient Morphology-Aware Policy Transfer to New Embodiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03660v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work, we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot performance of the base pretrained a policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 Figures, Published at the 2025 Reinforcement Learning Conference</p></details> |

While traditional sarcasm detection methods primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Its application in image processing, particularly for image enhancement, has gained increasing attention in recent years. This paper investigates the use of the Box-Cox transformation as a preprocessing step for image segmentation, with a focus on the estimation of the transformation parameter. We evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation by comparing various segmentation methods, highlighting its advantages for traditional machine learning techniques-especially in situations where no training data is available. The results demonstrate that the transformation enhances feature separability and computational efficiency, making it particularly beneficial for models like discriminant analysis. In contrast, deep learning models did not show consistent improvements, underscoring the differing impacts of the transformation across model types and image characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, the potential benefits and challenges of such capabilities to support diverse real-world assistive tasks remain unclear. In this paper, we present findings from an exploratory study with eight BVI participants. Participants used ChatGPT's Advanced Voice with Video, a state-of-the-art live video AI released in late 2024, in various real-world scenarios, from locating objects to recognizing visual landmarks, across unfamiliar indoor and outdoor environments. Our findings indicate that current live video AI effectively provides guidance and answers for static visual scenes but falls short in delivering essential live descriptions required in dynamic situations. Despite inaccuracies in spatial and distance information, participants leveraged the provided visual information to supplement their mobility strategies. Although the system was perceived as human-like due to high-quality voice interactions, assumptions about users' visual abilities, hallucinations, generic responses, and a tendency towards sycophancy led to confusion, distrust, and potential risks for BVI users. Based on the results, we discuss implications for assistive video AI agents, including incorporating additional sensing capabilities for real-world use, determining appropriate intervention timing beyond turn-taking interactions, and addressing ecological and safety concerns.</p></details> | ACM ASSETS 2025 |
| **[DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03645v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)</p></details> |

Current benchmarks often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880 pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4 document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness. Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4 MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new benchmarks on an annual basis.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission.

Prior work has largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete. We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.

We present SlideAudit, a dataset for automated slide evaluation. We collaborated with design experts to develop a thorough taxonomy of slide design flaws. Our dataset comprises 2400 slides collected and synthesized from multiple sources, including a subset intentionally modified with specific design problems. We then fully annotated them using our taxonomy through strictly trained crowdsourcing from Prolific. To evaluate whether AI is capable of identifying design flaws, we compared multiple large language models under different prompting strategies, and with an existing design critique pipeline. We show that AI models struggle to accurately identify slide design flaws, with F1 scores ranging from 0.331 to 0.655. Notably, prompting techniques leveraging our taxonomy achieved the highest performance. We further conducted a remediation study to assess AI's potential for improving slides. Among 82.0% of slides that showed significant improvement, 87.8% of them were improved more with our taxonomy, further demonstrating its utility.</p></details> | UIST 2025 |

This raises an issue as to which model should be used for modelling the effect of treatment on the outcome variable, $Y$. Should one fit, the stratum indicator, $S$, the continuous covariate, $X$, both or neither? This question has sometimes been investigated using simulations targeting the overall effect on inferences about treatment, in terms, for example, of power for a given alternative hypothesis. However, when a covariate is added to a linear model there are three consequences for inference: 1) the mean square error effect, 2) the variance inflation factor and 3) second order precision. We consider that it is valuable to consider these three factors separately, even if, ultimately, it is their joint effect that matters. We present some simple theory, concentrating in particular on the variance inflation factor, that may be used to guide trialists in their choice of model. We also consider the case where the precise form of the relationship between the outcome and the covariate is not known. We conclude by recommending that the continuous covariate should always be in the model but that, depending on circumstances, there may be some justification in fitting the stratum indicator also.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 Figures |

Unlike traditional attention approaches that require architecture-specific integration, our method introduces a standalone layer that spatially emphasizes high-importance regions in the input. We evaluated Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy. Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns.

| **[Robust Sensor-Limited Control with Safe Input-Output Constraints for Hydraulic In-Wheel Motor Drive Mobility Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11823v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-wheel drive (IWD) systems enhance the responsiveness, traction, and maintenance efficiency of vehicles by enabling each wheel to operate independently. This paper proposes a novel robust torque-observed valve-based control (RTOVC) framework to address velocity tracking in hydraulic IWDs that actuate heavy-duty wheeled mobile robots (HWMRs), considering such challenges as wheel slippages, sensor limitations, rough terrains, and modeling uncertainties. To overcome the sensor-dependent control systems associated with the closed-loop torque/pressure in hydraulic IWD-actuated HWMRs, a robust observer network based on an adaptive barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is proposed to estimate the required in-wheel motor torque to track the velocity references. Then, another adaptive BLF for valve control signals is employed to modulate the hydraulic fluid to generate the estimated torque for each IWD. The RTOVC strategy ensures user-defined safety within the logarithmic BLF framework by constraining the valve control signal, actual velocity, velocity tracking error, and torque of each hydraulic IWD in an HWMR to avoid exceeding specified limits. Despite its safety constraints, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties, robustness and uniformly exponential stability of the RTOVC-applied hydraulic IWD mechanism are ensured in HWMRs. Experimental investigations using a 6,500-kg HWMR, actuated by four independent IWDs under intense disturbances and safety-defined constraints, validate the performance of the RTOVC.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication in the Elsevier</p></details> |

Existing methods, however, face significant limitations in terms of stroke accuracy for complex text and controllability of generated text styles. To address these challenges, we propose TextMaster, a solution capable of accurately editing text across various scenarios and image regions, while ensuring proper layout and controllable text style. Our method enhances the accuracy and fidelity of text rendering by incorporating high-resolution standard glyph information and applying perceptual loss within the text editing region. Additionally, we leverage an attention mechanism to compute intermediate layer bounding box regression loss for each character, enabling the model to learn text layout across varying contexts. Furthermore, we propose a novel style injection technique that enables controllable style transfer for the injected text. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Estimating 3D rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures. Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 27th IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) 2025</p></details> |

Our approach extends the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient, with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICANN 2025</p></details> |

UCCT formalizes this process as Bayesian competition between statistical priors learned in pre-training and context-driven target patterns, yielding a single quantitative account that unifies existing adaptation techniques. We ground the theory in three principles: threshold crossing, modality universality, and density-distance predictive power, and validate them with (i) cross-domain demonstrations (text QA, image captioning, multi-agent debate) and (ii) two depth-oriented experiments: a controlled numeral-base study (bases 8, 9, 10) that isolates pattern-density effects, and a layer-wise trajectory analysis that reveals phase transitions inside a 7B-parameter model. Both experiments confirm UCCT's predictions of threshold behavior, asymmetric interference, and memory hysteresis. By showing that LLM ``intelligence'' is created through semantic anchoring rather than contained within the model, UCCT offers a principled foundation for interpretable diagnostics and practical guidance for prompt engineering, model selection, and alignment-centric system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figure, 2 table</p></details> |

Built on the standard expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler; (3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47 problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2 achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem provers.

However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion model from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Cameral-ready version: added experiments using the HPSv2 reward, improved notation consistency for the diffusion model, and added related works</p></details> |

Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.

However, these specifications require significant manual efforts to construct. This paper proposes a new approach, ELFuzz (Evolution Through Large Language Models for Fuzzing), that automatically synthesizes generation-based fuzzers tailored to a system under test (SUT) via LLM-driven synthesis over fuzzer space. At a high level, it starts with minimal seed fuzzers and propels the synthesis by fully automated LLM-driven evolution with coverage guidance. Compared to previous approaches, ELFuzz can 1) seamlessly scale to SUTs of real-world sizes -- up to 1,791,104 lines of code in our evaluation -- and 2) synthesize efficient fuzzers that catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. Our evaluation compared ELFuzz with specifications manually written by domain experts and synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that ELFuzz achieves up to 434.8% more coverage and triggers up to 174.0% more artificially injected bugs. We also used ELFuzz to conduct a real-world fuzzing campaign on the newest version of cvc5 for 14 days, and encouragingly, it found five 0-day bugs (three are exploitable). Moreover, we conducted an ablation study, which shows that the fuzzer space model, the key component of ELFuzz, contributes the most (up to 62.5%) to the effectiveness of ELFuzz. Further analysis of the fuzzers synthesized by ELFuzz confirms that they catch interesting grammatical structures and semantic constraints in a human-understandable way. The results present the promising potential of ELFuzz for more automated, efficient, and extensible input generation for fuzzing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security'25 Cycle 2</p></details> |

Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our understanding and impedes further development in this field.

A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

While recent advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits), Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement. However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect, information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user, compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically, but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the database leakage of the proposed schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.13812, arXiv:2411.10429</p></details> |

This, in turn, poses questions about the fairness of these models in critical settings, which leads to the developement of different procedures to address bias in Natural Language Processing. Although many datasets, metrics and algorithms have been proposed to measure and mitigate harmful prejudice in Natural Language Processing, their implementation is diverse and far from centralized. As a response, this paper presents FairLangProc, a comprehensive Python package providing a common implementation of some of the more recent advances in fairness in Natural Language Processing providing an interface compatible with the famous Hugging Face transformers library, aiming to encourage the widespread use and democratization of bias mitigation techniques.

State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21055v5)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by modeling the temporal order of actions, but has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining unseen "What if" scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. We conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

We evaluate the effectiveness of the transformation by comparing various segmentation methods, highlighting its advantages for traditional machine learning techniques-especially in situations where no training data is available. The results demonstrate that the transformation enhances feature separability and computational efficiency, making it particularly beneficial for models like discriminant analysis.

Conventional methods often decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet.

However, achieving them jointly remains a challenge. In this paper, we identify high learning rates as a facilitator for simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity. Our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is related to addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset. Our investigation of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon reveals the importance of confident mispredictions of bias-conflicting samples under large learning rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025, 25 pages</p></details> |

While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain, long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts, primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training, advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models, thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility for both research and production environments.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, a substantial volume of multimodal interleaved documents remains underutilized for contrastive vision-language representation learning. To fully leverage these unpaired documents, we initially establish a Real-World Data Extraction pipeline to extract high-quality images and texts. Then we design a hierarchical retrieval method to efficiently associate each image with multiple semantically relevant realistic texts. To further enhance fine-grained visual information, we propose an image semantic augmented generation module for synthetic text production. Furthermore, we employ a semantic balance sampling strategy to improve dataset diversity, enabling better learning of long-tail concepts. Based on these innovations, we construct RealSyn, a dataset combining realistic and synthetic texts, available in three scales: 15M, 30M, and 100M. We compare our dataset with other widely used datasets of equivalent scale for CLIP training. Models pre-trained on RealSyn consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, including linear probe, zero-shot transfer, zero-shot robustness, and zero-shot retrieval.

| **[Deciding subspace reachability problems with application to Skolem's Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06528v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The higher-dimensional version of Kannan and Lipton's Orbit Problem asks whether it is decidable if a target subspace can be reached from a starting point under repeated application of a linear transformation. Similarly, the continuous analog of the Orbit Problem asks if a flow induced by a linear system of differential equations ever reaches some specified subspace. The decidability of both problems remains open, and in fact the problems generalize the discrete and continuous versions of Skolem's Problem. The object of this paper is to communicate a geometric perspective of the discrete and continuous Orbit Problems, alternate to the traditional and highly technical algebraic and number-theoretic approaches to the problem. We derive a simple decision procedure capable of deciding a certain class of instances of the Orbit Problem, and, as an application, we obtain alternate proofs to a number of results using elementary geometric arguments.</p></details> | 24 pages, 0 figures |

However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models without requiring additional fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Individual Content and Motion Dynamics Preserved Pruning for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18375v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} (\textit{e.g.,} coherence of the entire video), while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} (\textit{e.g.,} individual frames). Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Moreover, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM to VDMini. In particular, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to preserve the consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$, 1.4 $\times$, and 1.25 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V, the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, and the T2V method HunyuanVideo, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on several benchmarks including UCF101, VBench-T2V, and VBench-I2V.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |
| **[Equivariant Volumetric Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18847v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation -- i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones. This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically, we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving higher performance with only a modest computational overhead.

While such systems promise increased autonomy, scalability, and intelligent decision-making across distributed environments, their adoption raises concerns regarding technical immaturity, integration complexity, organizational readiness, and performance-cost trade-offs. In this study, we conducted a preliminary thematic mapping to identify factors influencing the adoption of agentic software within the context of 6G. Drawing on a multivocal literature review and targeted scanning, we identified 29 motivators and 27 demotivators, which were further categorized into five high-level themes in each group. This thematic mapping offers a structured overview of the enabling and inhibiting forces shaping organizational readiness for agentic transformation. Positioned as a feasibility assessment, the study represents an early phase of a broader research initiative aimed at developing and validating a layered maturity model grounded in CMMI model with the software architectural three dimensions possibly Data, Business Logic, and Presentation. Ultimately, this work seeks to provide a practical framework to help software-driven organizations assess, structure, and advance their agent-first capabilities in alignment with the demands of 6G.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures and FIT'25 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Neutralizing Token Aggregation via Information Augmentation for Efficient Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03388v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including English and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrate that our method surpasses other methods in visual quality and text fidelity.

To narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates anatomical context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 16th MICCAI Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI2025)</p></details> |

However, as the size of the models grows, conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients. Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process: first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy, and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while assuming limited-resource clients.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages (main document) + 12 pages (appendix), 3 figures (main) + 12 figures (appendix), 5 tables (main) + 6 tables (appendix), submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Our modular transformation pipeline integrates a syntax checker to ensure syntactic correctness and features an iterative refinement mechanism that progressively reduces syntactic errors. We evaluate the proposed approach on a custom-generated dataset comprising diverse legacy playbooks paired with manually created CACAO references. The results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of playbook transformation over baseline models, effectively captures complex workflow structures, and substantially reduces errors.

We present LieQ, a metric-driven post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop, Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16 baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks.

However, individual LLMs often produce inconsistent outputs and exhibit biases, limiting their representation of diverse language patterns. The closed-source nature of many powerful LLMs further restricts industry applications due to data privacy concerns. Inspired by successes in text generation, LLM ensemble techniques are now increasingly explored for code generation. This article reviews these emerging ensemble approaches to enhance understanding, encourage further research, and promote practical implementation in both text and code generation. We categorize LLM ensembles into seven main methods - weight merging, knowledge fusion, mixture-of-experts, reward ensemble, output ensemble, routing, and cascading - analyzing capabilities of those approaches. Our findings highlight key benefits such as improved diversity representation, enhanced output quality, and greater application flexibility. These insights aid model selection for real-world tasks and crucially, lay groundwork for extending ensemble strategies to multimodal LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review by IEEE TAI</p></details> |

Knowledge Distillation (KD) provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, This paper was submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</p></details> |

Previous diffusion-based methods primarily rely on separate spatial and temporal attention mechanisms within the 3D U-Net. In contrast, state-of-the-art video Diffusion Transformers (DiT) models use 3D full attention, which does not explicitly separate temporal and spatial information. Thus, the interaction between spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling motion and appearance more challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we propose DeT, a method that adapts DiT models to improve motion transfer ability. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal dimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background appearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal variations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we introduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature space to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench, a general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a hybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion similarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than previous works. Extensive experiments on MTBench demonstrate that DeT achieves the best trade-off between motion fidelity and edit fidelity.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at A&A; 18+6 pages; 12+6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Embedding Models on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03280v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information. Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue. To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, WSI analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1) inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich global contextual understanding.

This inflexible approach can generate excessive tokens for even simple patterns like extended constant values, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Inspired by the success of byte pair encoding, we propose the first pattern-centric tokenization scheme for time series analysis. Based on a discrete vocabulary of frequent motifs, our method merges samples with underlying patterns into tokens, compressing time series adaptively. Exploiting our finite set of motifs and the continuous properties of time series, we further introduce conditional decoding as a lightweight yet powerful post-hoc optimization method, which requires no gradient computation and adds no computational overhead. On recent time series foundation models, our motif-based tokenization improves forecasting performance by 36% and boosts efficiency by 1990% on average. Conditional decoding further reduces MSE by up to 44%. In an extensive analysis, we demonstrate the adaptiveness of our tokenization to diverse temporal patterns, its generalization to unseen data, and its meaningful token representations capturing distinct time series properties, including statistical moments and trends.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages in total, 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[Identifying actionable driver mutations in lung cancer using an efficient Asymmetric Transformer Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02431v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025 Workshop COMPAYL</p></details> |
| **[MVTOP: Multi-View Transformer-based Object Pose-Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03243v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features, our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.</p></details> | 43 pages |

However, collecting high-quality paired makeup datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://yangxingchao.github.io/FFHQ-Makeup-page, Datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cyberagent/FFHQ-Makeup</p></details> |

This framework has been well studied using mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.</p></details> | 17 pages |

While iterative learning model predictive control (LMPC) offers a promising framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with three key innovations: (1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence, (2) a shifted local safe set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates, and (3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85%. Even applied to the most aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real drone, a 6.05% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak performance of drone racing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at IROS 2025</p></details> |

Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore, developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code is available in the supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,2 figures,6 tables</p></details> |

| **[PAC Apprenticeship Learning with Bayesian Active Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03693v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at RLC 2025</p></details> |

Our algorithm, LEAP (Learning Event-recording Automata Passively), constructs a possibly nondeterministic ERA from such samples based on merging techniques. We prove that determining whether two ERA states can be merged while preserving sample consistency is an NP-complete problem, and address this with a practical SMT-based solution. Our implementation demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness through examples. We also show that every ERA-definable language can be inferred using our algorithm with a suitable sample.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Shorter version of this article has been accepted at ATVA 2025</p></details> |

This raises an issue as to which model should be used for modelling the effect of treatment on the outcome variable, $Y$. Should one fit, the stratum indicator, $S$, the continuous covariate, $X$, both or neither? This question has sometimes been investigated using simulations targeting the overall effect on inferences about treatment, in terms, for example, of power for a given alternative hypothesis. However, when a covariate is added to a linear model there are three consequences for inference: 1) the mean square error effect, 2) the variance inflation factor and 3) second order precision. We consider that it is valuable to consider these three factors separately, even if, ultimately, it is their joint effect that matters. We present some simple theory, concentrating in particular on the variance inflation factor, that may be used to guide trialists in their choice of model. We also consider the case where the precise form of the relationship between the outcome and the covariate is not known. We conclude by recommending that the continuous covariate should always be in the model but that, depending on circumstances, there may be some justification in fitting the stratum indicator also.</p></details> | 22 pages, 7 Figures |

However, optimizing these models for downstream tasks often involves nested bilevel structures, such as tuning hyperparameters for fine-tuning tasks or noise schedules in training dynamics, where traditional bilevel methods fail due to the infinite-dimensional probability space and prohibitive sampling costs. We formalize this challenge as a generative bilevel optimization problem and address two key scenarios: (1) fine-tuning pre-trained models via an inference-only lower-level solver paired with a sample-efficient gradient estimator for the upper level, and (2) training diffusion model from scratch with noise schedule optimization by reparameterizing the lower-level problem and designing a computationally tractable gradient estimator. Our first-order bilevel framework overcomes the incompatibility of conventional bilevel methods with diffusion processes, offering theoretical grounding and computational practicality. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing fine-tuning and hyperparameter search baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Cameral-ready version: added experiments using the HPSv2 reward, improved notation consistency for the diffusion model, and added related works</p></details> |

Unlike popular model serving systems that rely on monolithic and heuristic task schedulers, Block operates as a fully distributed, stateless, and predictive scheduling system to achieve low overhead, reliability, and scalability. It leverages the deterministic and predictable characteristics of LLM inferences, such as host configurations, response lengths, and hardware performance, to make scheduling decisions based on accurately predicted metrics. Evaluation on a 12 GPUs cluster shows that Block significantly outperforms heuristic schedulers, boosting serving capacity by up to 16.7\% and reducing P99 tail latency by up to 49.5\%. These performance gains remain consistent across diverse models, workloads and configurations.

However, static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines, DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE DSAA 2025 (10 pages, 5 figures)</p></details> |
| **[Pseudo-Autoregressive Neural Codec Language Models for Efficient Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10352v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.

| **[Set-Based Training for Neural Network Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14961v4)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e., small input perturbations can significantly affect the outputs of a neural network. Therefore, to ensure safety of neural networks in safety-critical environments, the robustness of a neural network must be formally verified against input perturbations, e.g., from noisy sensors. To improve the robustness of neural networks and thus simplify the formal verification, we present a novel set-based training procedure in which we compute the set of possible outputs given the set of possible inputs and compute for the first time a gradient set, i.e., each possible output has a different gradient. Therefore, we can directly reduce the size of the output enclosure by choosing gradients toward its center. Small output enclosures increase the robustness of a neural network and, at the same time, simplify its formal verification. The latter benefit is due to the fact that a larger size of propagated sets increases the conservatism of most verification methods. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that set-based training produces robust neural networks with competitive performance, which can be verified using fast (polynomial-time) verification algorithms due to the reduced output set.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Individual Content and Motion Dynamics Preserved Pruning for Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18375v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} (\textit{e.g.,} coherence of the entire video), while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} (\textit{e.g.,} individual frames). Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Moreover, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM to VDMini. In particular, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to preserve the consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$, 1.4 $\times$, and 1.25 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V, the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, and the T2V method HunyuanVideo, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on several benchmarks including UCF101, VBench-T2V, and VBench-I2V.</p></details> | ACM MM 2025 |

Time for a Quadruple Shot: Knowledge Graph Construction using Enhanced Triple Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03438v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG) generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures, Published in the Annual Conference of South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists, Preprint (author original)</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03437v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 poster |
| **[NeuroSync: Intent-Aware Code-Based Problem Solving via Direct LLM Understanding Modification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02823v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conversational LLMs have been widely adopted by domain users with limited programming experience to solve domain problems. However, these users often face misalignment between their intent and generated code, resulting in frustration and rounds of clarification. This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UIST 2025</p></details> |

However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly with diffusion models, offer significant promise for effectively minimizing the visibility of bone structures in CXR images, thereby improving clarity and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, existing diffusion-based methods for bone suppression in CXR imaging struggle to balance the complete suppression of bones with preserving local texture details. Additionally, their high computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical use in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model combines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion, enabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle potential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we further propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without additional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset SZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers superior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency, significantly outperforming several competitive methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/diaoquesang/GL-LCM.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[VLMQ: Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models via Hessian Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03351v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

We present LieQ, a metric-driven post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop, Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16 baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.</p></details> | low-bit quantization |

Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuro...</summary><p>Neuromorphic Radar, Hand Gesture Recognition, Event-Driven, Sigma-Delta Encoding, Sparse Representation.

| **[BDFirewall: Towards Effective and Expeditiously Black-Box Backdoor Defense in MLaaS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03307v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we endeavor to address the challenges of backdoor attacks countermeasures in black-box scenarios, thereby fortifying the security of inference under MLaaS. We first categorize backdoor triggers from a new perspective, i.e., their impact on the patched area, and divide them into: high-visibility triggers (HVT), semi-visibility triggers (SVT), and low-visibility triggers (LVT). Based on this classification, we propose a progressive defense framework, BDFirewall, that removes these triggers from the most conspicuous to the most subtle, without requiring model access. First, for HVTs, which create the most significant local semantic distortions, we identify and eliminate them by detecting these salient differences. We then restore the patched area to mitigate the adverse impact of such removal process. The localized purification designed for HVTs is, however, ineffective against SVTs, which globally perturb benign features. We therefore model an SVT-poisoned input as a mixture of a trigger and benign features, where we unconventionally treat the benign features as "noise". This formulation allows us to reconstruct SVTs by applying a denoising process that removes these benign "noise" features. The SVT-free input is then obtained by subtracting the reconstructed trigger. Finally, to neutralize the nearly imperceptible but fragile LVTs, we introduce lightweight noise to disrupt the trigger pattern and then apply DDPM to restore any collateral impact on clean features. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art defenses. Compared with baselines, BDFirewall reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by an average of 33.25%, improving poisoned sample accuracy (PA) by 29.64%, and achieving up to a 111x speedup in inference time. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Unlike prior models that perform local edits, SMART-Editor preserves global coherence through two strategies: Reward-Refine, an inference-time rewardguided refinement method, and RewardDPO, a training-time preference optimization approach using reward-aligned layout pairs. To evaluate model performance, we introduce SMARTEdit-Bench, a benchmark covering multi-domain, cascading edit scenarios. SMART-Editor outperforms strong baselines like InstructPix2Pix and HIVE, with RewardDPO achieving up to 15% gains in structured settings and Reward-Refine showing advantages on natural images. Automatic and human evaluations confirm the value of reward-guided planning in producing semantically consistent and visually aligned edits.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This requires some internal approval before the public release</p></details> |
| **[LADSG: Label-Anonymized Distillation and Similar Gradient Substitution for Label Privacy in Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06742v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training across distributed feature spaces, which enables privacy-preserving learning without sharing raw data. However, recent studies have confirmed the feasibility of label inference attacks by internal adversaries. By strategically exploiting gradient vectors and semantic embeddings, attackers-through passive, active, or direct attacks-can accurately reconstruct private labels, leading to catastrophic data leakage. Existing defenses, which typically address isolated leakage vectors or are designed for specific types of attacks, remain vulnerable to emerging hybrid attacks that exploit multiple pathways simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose Label-Anonymized Defense with Substitution Gradient (LADSG), a unified and lightweight defense framework for VFL. LADSG first anonymizes true labels via soft distillation to reduce semantic exposure, then generates semantically-aligned substitute gradients to disrupt gradient-based leakage, and finally filters anomalous updates through gradient norm detection. It is scalable and compatible with standard VFL pipelines. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that LADSG reduces the success rates of all three types of label inference attacks by 30-60% with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[MVTOP: Multi-View Transformer-based Object Pose-Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03243v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features, our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MemOS: A Memory OS for AI System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03724v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory management systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual personalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on static parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to track user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain text, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or integration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the training and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective, showing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and external retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing specific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader challenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context, requiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning different temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose MemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system resource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of plaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling cost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates both memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes can be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions between memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning. MemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings controllability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation for continual learning and personalized modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[ChartCap: Mitigating Hallucination of Dense Chart Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03164v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |

A necessary enabler to this capability is to find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods, such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates, whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Pr...</summary><p>in Proc. 75th Int.

| **[The Curse of Conditions: Analyzing and Improving Optimal Transport for Conditional Flow-Based Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10636v3)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets.

| **[Quantization Meets dLLMs: A Systematic Study of Post-training Quantization for Diffusion LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14896v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and experimental setups will be released to support the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Work in Progress</p></details> |
| **[Virtual Community: An Open World for Humans, Robots, and Society](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14893v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website https://virtual-community-ai.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Snap-Snap: Taking Two Images to Reconstruct 3D Human Gaussians in Milliseconds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14892v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic, which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information, and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data collection. Demos and code are available at https://hustvl.github.io/Snap-Snap/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hustvl.github.io/Snap-Snap/</p></details> |
| **[GaussianArt: Unified Modeling of Geometry and Motion for Articulated Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14891v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization. To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sainingzhang.github.io/project/gaussianart/</p></details> |
| **[Novel Knockoff Generation and Importance Measures with Heterogeneous Data via Conditional Residuals and Local Gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14882v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knockoff variable selection is a powerful framework that creates synthetic knockoff variables to mirror the correlation structure of the observed features, enabling principled control of the false discovery rate in variable selection. However, existing methods often assume homogeneous data types or known distributions, limiting their applicability in real-world settings with heterogeneous, distribution-free data. Moreover, common variable importance measures rely on linear outcome models, hindering their effectiveness for complex relationships. We propose a flexible knockoff generation framework based on conditional residuals that accommodates mixed data types without assuming known distributions. To assess variable importance, we introduce the Mean Absolute Local Derivative (MALD), an interpretable metric compatible with nonlinear outcome functions, including random forests and neural networks. Simulations show that our approach achieves better false discovery rate control and higher power than existing methods. We demonstrate its practical utility on a DNA methylation dataset from mouse tissues, identifying CpG sites linked to aging. Software is available in R (rangerKnockoff) and Python (MALDimportance).</p></details> | Submitted to JMLR |
| **[RotBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models on Identifying Image Rotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13968v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information -- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images, while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and human perception in identifying rotation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages.

| **[MedReseacher-R1: Expert-Level Medical Deep Researcher via A Knowledge-Informed Trajectory Synthesis Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14880v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[What Makes for Good Image Captions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00485v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper establishes a formal information-theoretic framework for image captioning, conceptualizing captions as compressed linguistic representations that selectively encode semantic units in images. Our framework posits that good image captions should balance three key aspects: informationally sufficient, minimally redundant, and readily comprehensible by humans. By formulating these aspects as quantitative measures with adjustable weights, our framework provides a flexible foundation for analyzing and optimizing image captioning systems across diverse task requirements. To demonstrate its applicability, we introduce the Pyramid of Captions (PoCa) method, which generates enriched captions by integrating local and global visual information. We present both theoretical proof that PoCa improves caption quality under certain assumptions, and empirical validation of its effectiveness across various image captioning models and datasets.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Squeezed Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14871v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis - consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[GenVC: Self-Supervised Zero-Shot Voice Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04519v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most current zero-shot voice conversion methods rely on externally supervised components, particularly speaker encoders, for training. To explore alternatives that eliminate this dependency, this paper introduces GenVC, a novel framework that disentangles speaker identity and linguistic content from speech signals in a self-supervised manner. GenVC leverages speech tokenizers and an autoregressive, Transformer-based language model as its backbone for speech generation. This design supports large-scale training while enhancing both source speaker privacy protection and target speaker cloning fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that GenVC achieves notably higher speaker similarity, with naturalness on par with leading zero-shot approaches. Moreover, due to its autoregressive formulation, GenVC introduces flexibility in temporal alignment, reducing the preservation of source prosody and speaker-specific traits, and making it highly effective for voice anonymization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by 2025 IEEE ASRU</p></details> |
| **[LoSiA: Efficient High-Rank Fine-Tuning via Subnet Localization and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04487v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank decomposition matrices. However, existing methods perform extensive matrix multiplications in domain specialization tasks, resulting in computational inefficiency and sub-optimal fine-tuning performance. Hence, we propose LoSiA(Low-Resources Subnet Integration Adaptation), an innovative method that dynamically localizes and optimizes critical parameters during the training process. Specifically, it identifies a sub-network using gradient sparsity analysis and optimizes it as the trainable target. This design enables effective high-rank adaptation by updating only the sub-network parameters, reducing the additional matrix multiplication. We also present LoSiA-Pro, a faster implementation of LoSiA, which reduces the training latency by about $27\%$ compared to LoRA. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves minimal performance drop compared to full fine-tuning, while requiring the least training time across domain specialization and common-sense reasoning tasks. Further analysis shows that LoSiA also reduces forgetting during continued training. The source code is available at https://github.com/KlozeWang/LoSiA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference); 18 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |
| **[Graph Structure Learning with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck for Inductive Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14859v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges: effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization. GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets; they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting, with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI), 2025</p></details> |
| **[It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794v5)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the content verification process is essential to maintaining the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a rational verifier may not have the incentive to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could incentivize lazy reporting and undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems, particularly for verification-expensive decentralized AI applications. In this paper, we initiate the research with the development of a Byzantine-robust peer prediction framework towards the design of one-phase Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification games among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations, malicious players and inaccurate priors in the verification process, proposing the compactness criteria that ensures such robustness guarantees. With robust incentive guarantees and budget efficiency, our study provides a framework of incentive design for decentralized verification protocols that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain, decentralized AI, and potentially other decentralized systems.</p></details> | 63 pages |

We present a novel multimodal Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that enhances Enzyme Commission (EC) classification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities: protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind enzyme function. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal QVT model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other QML models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) 2025</p></details> |
| **["When I lost it, they dragged me out": How Care Encounters Empower Marginalized Young Adults' Aspiration and Mental Health Care-Seeking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11277v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental health care-seeking among marginalized young adults has received limited attention in CSCW research. Through in-depth interviews and visual elicitation methods with 18 diverse U.S. participants, our study reveals how marginalized identities shape mental health care-seeking journeys, often characterized by low aspirations and passive care-seeking influenced by lived experiences of marginalization. However, we found the transformative function of "care encounters" - serendipitous interactions with mental health resources that occur when individuals are not actively seeking support. These encounters serve as critical turning points, catalyzing shifts in aspiration and enabling more proactive care-seeking behaviors. Our analysis identifies both the infrastructural conditions that enable transformative care encounters and the aspiration breakdowns that impede care-seeking processes. This work makes conceptual contributions by supplementing traditional motivation-based care-seeking models with a reconceptualization of "care encounters" that accounts for the infrastructural and serendipitous nature of mental health access. We advance understanding of how marginalized identity uniquely influences care-seeking behaviors while providing actionable design implications for embedding technology-mediated "care encounters" into socio-technical interventions that can better support mental health care access for vulnerable populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CSCW 25. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.08994</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Risk-Aware MPPI for Mobile Robots in Crowds via Efficient Monte Carlo Approximations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21205v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI), a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function. Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet planner, and vanilla MPPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IROS 2025.

| **[Action Engine: Automatic Workflow Generation in FaaS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19485v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge, platform dependence, and difficulty in scalability in building functional workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by injecting the user-provided arguments. On another front, this work addresses a gap in tool-augmented LLM research via adopting an Automatic FaaS Workflow Generation perspective to systematically evaluate methodologies across four fundamental sub-processes. Through benchmarking various parameters, this research provides critical insights into streamlining workflow automation for real-world applications, specifically in the FaaS continuum. Our evaluations demonstrate that the Action Engine achieves comparable performance to the few-shot learning approach while maintaining platform- and language-agnosticism, thereby, mitigating provider-specific dependencies in workflow generation. We notice that Action Engine can unlock FaaS workflow generation for non-cloud-savvy developers and expedite the development cycles of cloud-native applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) journal; Source code is available at: https://github.com/hpcclab/action_engine</p></details> |
| **[TIME$[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ via Tree Height Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14831v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing machines, showing ${\rm TIME}[[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$. The key step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$ at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners. Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming, ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with $b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$ gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$ bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for SPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and $O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14828v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third, data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SCALR @ COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[The C-index Multiverse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14821v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring. Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse, providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing software.

In the rectilinear Marco Polo problem, there is at least one point of interest (POI) within distance $n$, in either the $L_1$ or $L_\infty$ metric, from the origin. Motivated from a search-and-rescue application, our goal is to move a search point, $\Delta$, from the origin to a location within distance $1$ of a POI. We periodically issue probes from $\Delta$ out a given distance (in either the $L_1$ or $L_\infty$ metric) and if a POI is within the specified distance of $\Delta$, then we learn this (but no other location information). Optimization goals are to minimize the number of probes and the distance traveled by $\Delta$. We describe a number of efficient search strategies for rectilinear Marco Polo problems and we analyze each one in terms of the size, $n$, of the search domain, as defined by the maximum distance to a POI.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 page, 14 pages, appeared in CCCG 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Billing Protocol with Dynamic Tariff Policy Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14815v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) with traditional power grids has led to the emergence of smart grids. Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) plays a crucial role in smart grids by facilitating two-way communication between smart meters and the utility provider. This bidirectional communication allows intelligent meters to report fine-grained consumption data at predefined intervals, enabling accurate billing, efficient grid monitoring and management, and rapid outage detection. However, the collection of detailed consumption data can inadvertently disclose consumers' daily activities, raising privacy concerns and potentially leading to privacy violations. To address these issues and preserve individuals' privacy, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving smart metering protocol specifically designed to support real-time tariff billing service with dynamic policy adjustment. Our scheme employs an efficient data perturbation technique to obscure precise energy usage data from internal adversaries, including the intermediary gateways and the utility provider. Subsequently, we validate the efficiency and security of our protocol through comprehensive performance and privacy evaluations. We examined the computational, memory, and communication overhead of the proposed scheme. The execution time of our secure and privacy-aware billing system is approximately 3.94540 seconds for a complete year.

This makes them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets, injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal. The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination harmonization and editing.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

In this work, we investigate whether LLM judges truly benefit from enhanced reasoning capabilities. Through a detailed analysis of reasoning requirements across evaluation tasks, we reveal a negative correlation between SFT performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples - highlighting the limitations of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. JudgeLRM models consistently outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models. Notably, JudgeLRM-3B surpasses GPT-4, and JudgeLRM-7B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score, particularly excelling in judge tasks requiring deep reasoning.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach, named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA), that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the other state-of-the-art link prediction models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

The SW metric has gained significant interest in the optimal transport and machine learning literature, due to its ability to capture intricate geometric properties of probability distributions while remaining computationally tractable, making it a valuable tool for various applications, including generative modeling and domain adaptation. Our study aims to provide a rigorous analysis of the critical points arising from the optimization of the SW objective. By computing explicit perturbations, we establish that stable critical points of SW cannot concentrate on segments. This stability analysis is crucial for understanding the behaviour of optimization algorithms for models trained using the SW objective. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the SW objective, shedding light on the existence and convergence behavior of critical points. We illustrate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.</p></details> | 32p |

To tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured, multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs. Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and recommendations by leveraging an initial schema.

To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence. However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models" through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored to individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such as SOTA VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive human annotations to ensure evaluation alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of intrinsic faithfulness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors.

However, current work has been largely focused on text-based mathematical problems, with limited investigation in problems involving geometric information. Addressing this gap, we aim to enable LLMs to solve geometric problems by understanding image input. We first analyze the limitations of current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this area: they struggle to accurately comprehending basic geometric elements and their relationships. To overcome these challenges, we take advantage of the unique characteristics of geometric problems (such as unique geometric logical form, and geometric scalability) and the capacity of the textual LLMs to build an enriched multimodal geometry dataset based on existing data. The augmented dataset, Geo170K, contains more than 170K geometric image-caption and question-answer pairs. Utilizing our constructed Geo170K dataset, we develop G-LLaVA, which demonstrates exceptional performance in solving geometric problems, significantly outperforming GPT-4-V on the MathVista benchmark with only 7B parameters.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In applications, however, it's often the case that sample sizes are data-dependent rather than predetermined. The aforementioned methods aren't reliable in this latter case, hence the recent interest in e-processes and methods that are anytime valid, i.e., reliable for any dynamic data-collection plan. But if the investigator has relevant-yet-incomplete prior information about the quantity of interest, then there's an opportunity for efficiency gain. This paper proposes a regularized e-process framework featuring a knowledge-based, imprecise-probabilistic regularization with improved efficiency. A generalized version of Ville's inequality is established, ensuring that inference based on the regularized e-process are anytime valid in a novel, knowledge-dependent sense. Regularized e-processes also facilitate possibility-theoretic uncertainty quantification with strong frequentist-like calibration properties and other Bayesian-like properties: satisfies the likelihood principle, avoids sure-loss, and offers formal decision-making with reliability guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments welcome (via email or) at https://researchers.one/articles/24.09.00003</p></details> |

These tracking data can be used to calibrate mathematical models describing the motility of individual entities. The challenges in calibrating models for single-agent motion derive from the intrinsic characteristics of experimental data, collected at discrete time steps and with measurement noise. We consider motion of individual agents that can be described by velocity-jump models in one spatial dimension. These agents transition between a network of \textit{n} states, in which each state is associated with a fixed velocity and fixed rates of switching to every other state. Exploiting approximate solutions to the resultant stochastic process, we develop a Bayesian inference framework to calibrate these models to discrete-time noisy data. We first demonstrate that the framework can be used to effectively recover the model parameters of data simulated from two-state and three-state models. Finally, we explore the question of model selection first using simulated data and then using experimental data tracking mRNA transport inside \textit{Drosophila} neurons. Overall, our results demonstrate that the framework is effective and efficient in calibrating and selecting between velocity-jump models and it can be applied to a range of motion processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures SI: 21 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[Coupling without Communication and Drafter-Invariant Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07978v4)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suppose Alice has a distribution $P$ and Bob has a distribution $Q$. Alice wants to draw a sample $a\sim P$ and Bob a sample $b \sim Q$ such that $a = b$ with as high of probability as possible. It is well-known that, by sampling from an optimal coupling between the distributions, Alice and Bob can achieve $\Pr[a = b] = 1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)$, where $D_{TV}(P,Q)$ is the total variation distance between $P$ and $Q$. What if Alice and Bob must solve this same problem \emph{without communicating at all?} Perhaps surprisingly, with access to public randomness, they can still achieve $\Pr[a = b] \geq \frac{1 - D_{TV}(P,Q)}{1 + D_{TV}(P,Q)} \geq 1-2D_{TV}(P,Q)$ using a simple protocol based on the Weighted MinHash algorithm. This bound was shown to be optimal in the worst-case by [Bavarian et al., 2020]. In this work, we revisit the communication-free coupling problem. We provide a simpler proof of the optimality result from [Bavarian et al., 2020]. We show that, while the worst-case success probability of Weighted MinHash cannot be improved, an equally simple protocol based on Gumbel sampling offers a Pareto improvement: for every pair of distributions $P, Q$, Gumbel sampling achieves an equal or higher value of $\Pr[a = b]$ than Weighted MinHash. Importantly, this improvement translates to practice. We demonstrate an application of communication-free coupling to \emph{speculative decoding}, a recent method for accelerating autoregressive large language models [Leviathan, Kalman, Matias, ICML 2023]. We show that communication-free protocols can be used to contruct \emph{\CSD{}} schemes, which have the desirable property that their output is fixed given a fixed random seed, regardless of what drafter is used for speculation. In experiments on a language generation task, Gumbel sampling outperforms Weighted MinHash. Code is available at https://github.com/majid-daliri/DISD.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and experimental setups will be released to support the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Work in Progress</p></details> |

To explore this future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots, and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these, Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website https://virtual-community-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information, and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality. Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data collection.

Our framework posits that good image captions should balance three key aspects: informationally sufficient, minimally redundant, and readily comprehensible by humans. By formulating these aspects as quantitative measures with adjustable weights, our framework provides a flexible foundation for analyzing and optimizing image captioning systems across diverse task requirements. To demonstrate its applicability, we introduce the Pyramid of Captions (PoCa) method, which generates enriched captions by integrating local and global visual information. We present both theoretical proof that PoCa improves caption quality under certain assumptions, and empirical validation of its effectiveness across various image captioning models and datasets.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Experimental results demonstrate that GenVC achieves notably higher speaker similarity, with naturalness on par with leading zero-shot approaches. Moreover, due to its autoregressive formulation, GenVC introduces flexibility in temporal alignment, reducing the preservation of source prosody and speaker-specific traits, and making it highly effective for voice anonymization.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by 2025 IEEE ASRU</p></details> |

Through in-depth interviews and visual elicitation methods with 18 diverse U.S. participants, our study reveals how marginalized identities shape mental health care-seeking journeys, often characterized by low aspirations and passive care-seeking influenced by lived experiences of marginalization. However, we found the transformative function of "care encounters" - serendipitous interactions with mental health resources that occur when individuals are not actively seeking support. These encounters serve as critical turning points, catalyzing shifts in aspiration and enabling more proactive care-seeking behaviors. Our analysis identifies both the infrastructural conditions that enable transformative care encounters and the aspiration breakdowns that impede care-seeking processes. This work makes conceptual contributions by supplementing traditional motivation-based care-seeking models with a reconceptualization of "care encounters" that accounts for the infrastructural and serendipitous nature of mental health access. We advance understanding of how marginalized identity uniquely influences care-seeking behaviors while providing actionable design implications for embedding technology-mediated "care encounters" into socio-technical interventions that can better support mental health care access for vulnerable populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CSCW 25. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.08994</p></details> |

The key step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$ at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners. Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming, ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with $b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$ gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$ bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for SPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and $O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.</p></details> | 32 pages |

The proposed technique addresses the limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods (homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation. Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for ship detection from the same scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author version of the submission to the IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Identity Preserving 3D Head Stylization with Multiview Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13536v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D head stylization transforms realistic facial features into artistic representations, enhancing user engagement across gaming and virtual reality applications. While 3D-aware generators have made significant advancements, many 3D stylization methods primarily provide near-frontal views and struggle to preserve the unique identities of original subjects, often resulting in outputs that lack diversity and individuality. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging the PanoHead model, synthesizing images from a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. We propose a novel framework that employs negative log-likelihood distillation (LD) to enhance identity preservation and improve stylization quality. By integrating multi-view grid score and mirror gradients within the 3D GAN architecture and introducing a score rank weighing technique, our approach achieves substantial qualitative and quantitative improvements. Our findings not only advance the state of 3D head stylization but also provide valuable insights into effective distillation processes between diffusion models and GANs, focusing on the critical issue of identity preservation.

As these models become increasingly used in high-stakes domains, such as healthcare and finance, the need for effective hallucination detection is crucial. To this end, we outline a versatile framework for zero-resource hallucination detection that practitioners can apply to real-world use cases. To achieve this, we adapt a variety of existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques, including black-box UQ, white-box UQ, and LLM-as-a-Judge, transforming them as necessary into standardized response-level confidence scores ranging from 0 to 1. To enhance flexibility, we propose a tunable ensemble approach that incorporates any combination of the individual confidence scores. This approach enables practitioners to optimize the ensemble for a specific use case for improved performance. To streamline implementation, the full suite of scorers is offered in this paper's companion Python toolkit, UQLM. To evaluate the performance of the various scorers, we conduct an extensive set of experiments using several LLM question-answering benchmarks. We find that our tunable ensemble typically surpasses its individual components and outperforms existing hallucination detection methods. Our results demonstrate the benefits of customized hallucination detection strategies for improving the accuracy and reliability of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>UQLM ...</summary><p>UQLM repository: https://github.com/cvs-health/uqlm</p></details> |

We develop multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency (BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy, and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

The soft inequality constraints are integrated by introducing an additional extended Kalman Filter (EKF) update step using pseudo-measurements. The sequential formulation of the algorithm and several developed heuristics ensure both the performance and a low computational effort of the algorithm. A special focus lies on an efficient consideration of monotonicity assumptions for GPs in the form of inequality constraints. The algorithm is statistically validated in simulations, where the possible advantages in comparison with the standard RGP algorithm become obvious. The paper is concluded with a successful experimental validation of the developed algorithm for the monotonicity-preserving learning of heat transfer values for the control of a vapor compression cycle evaporator, leveraging a previously published partial input output linearization (IOL).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICINCO 2025 (22nd International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics)</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6 core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks. Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks. Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://mcp-universe.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Reachability is Decidable for ATM-Typable Finitary PCF with Effect Handlers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12572v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that the reachability problem for simply-typed lambda calculus with recursive definitions and finite base-type values (finitary PCF) is decidable. A recent paper by Dal Lago and Ghyselen has shown that the same problem becomes undecidable when the language is extended with algebraic effect and handlers (effect handlers). We show that, perhaps surprisingly, the problem becomes decidable even with effect handlers when the type system is extended with answer type modification (ATM). A natural intuition may find the result contradictory, because one would expect allowing ATM makes more programs typable. Indeed, this intuition is correct in that there are programs that are typable with ATM but not without it, as we shall show in the paper. However, a corollary of our decidability result is that the converse is true as well: there are programs that are typable without ATM but becomes untypable with ATM, and we will show concrete examples of such programs in the paper. Our decidability result is proven by a novel continuation passing style (CPS) transformation that transforms an ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect handlers to a finitary PCF program without effect handlers. Additionally, as another application of our CPS transformation, we show that every recursive-function-free ATM-typable finitary PCF program with effect handlers terminates, while there are (necessarily ATM-untypable) recursive-function-free finitary PCF programs with effect handlers that may diverge. Finally, we disprove a claim made in a recent work that proved a similar but strictly weaker decidability result. We foresee our decidability result to lay a foundation for developing verification methods for programs with effect handlers, just as the decidability result for reachability of finitary PCF has done such for programs without effect handlers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper to appear in APLAS 2025</p></details> |

Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data. ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new, contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 4 figures.

Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection, trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages after compiling, 3025 words, 6 figures, 5 tables and an algorithm</p></details> |
| **[DualNILM: Energy Injection Identification Enabled Disaggregation with Deep Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14600v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture, DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional methods.</p></details> | Preprint |

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

To this end, we introduce an innovative metric, the Task-oriented Age of Information (TAoI), to measure whether the content of information is relevant to the system task, thereby assisting the system in efficiently completing designated tasks. We apply TAoI to a wireless monitoring system tasked with identifying targets and transmitting their images for subsequent analysis. To minimize TAoI and determine the optimal transmission policy, we formulate the dynamic transmission problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) and transform it into an equivalent Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal policy is threshold-based with respect to TAoI. Building on this, we propose a low-complexity relative value iteration algorithm tailored to this threshold structure to derive the optimal transmission policy. Additionally, we introduce a simpler single-threshold policy, which, despite a slight performance degradation, offers faster convergence. Comprehensive experiments and simulations validate the superior performance of our optimal transmission policy compared to two established baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the lEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action'' examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.</p></details> | Accepted at ICSR25 |

We propose an efficient method to render photorealistic images of such scans without any expensive preprocessing or training of a scene-specific model. A naive projection of the point cloud to the output view using 1x1 pixels is fast and retains the available detail, but also results in unintelligible renderings as background points leak in between the foreground pixels. The key insight is that these projections can be transformed into a realistic result using a deep convolutional model in the form of a U-Net, and a depth-based heuristic that prefilters the data. The U-Net also handles LiDAR-specific problems such as missing parts due to occlusion, color inconsistencies and varying point densities. We also describe a method to generate synthetic training data to deal with imperfectly-aligned ground truth images. Our method achieves real-time rendering rates using an off-the-shelf GPU and outperforms the state-of-the-art in both speed and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Eurographics 2025</p></details> |

Recently, control barrier functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective method to integrate safety constraints into control synthesis through optimization techniques. However, challenges persist when dealing with convex primitives and tasks requiring torque control, as well as the occurrence of unintended equilibria. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a high-order CBF (HOCBF) framework for collision avoidance among convex primitives. We transform nonconvex safety constraints into linear constraints by differentiable optimization and prove the high-order continuous differentiability. Then, we employ HOCBFs to accommodate torque control, enabling tasks involving forces or high dynamics. Additionally, we analyze the issue of spurious equilibria in high-order cases and propose a circulation mechanism to prevent the undesired equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. Finally, we validate our framework with three experiments on the Franka Research 3 robotic manipulator, demonstrating successful collision avoidance and the efficacy of the circulation mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology</p></details> |

Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MAPR 2025</p></details> |

As video length increases, issues such as visual degradation, loss of identity consistency, temporal incoherence, and error accumulation become increasingly prominent, severely impacting the realism and reliability of generated results. To address these issues, we present LetsTalk, a diffusion transformer framework that incorporates multimodal guidance and a novel memory bank mechanism, explicitly maintaining contextual continuity and enabling robust, high-quality, and efficient long-duration talking video generation. Specifically, LetsTalk introduces a memory bank combined with a noise-regularized training strategy to mitigate error accumulation and sampling artifacts during long video generation. To further enhance efficiency and spatiotemporal consistency, LetsTalk employs a deep compression autoencoder and a spatiotemporal-aware transformer with linear attention for effective multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we systematically analyze three multimodal fusion schemes, adopting deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait features to ensure visual consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to synchronize animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LetsTalk achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic talking videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency with 8 fewer parameters than previous approaches.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Performance is evaluated across operational metrics such as resource utilization, ingestion throughput, calibration accuracy, and data availability, offering practical insights into building sustainable environmental data platforms.

Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii) channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing (STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB) and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at [this http URL link](https://cmlab-korea.github.io/MoCHAformer-Demo/)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel metric called Age of Incorrect Semantics (AoIS) for the transmission of video frames over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in a monitoring system. Different from the conventional age-based approaches, we jointly consider the information freshness and the semantic importance, and then formulate a time-averaged AoIS minimization problem by jointly optimizing the semantic actuation indicator, transceiver beamformer, and the semantic symbol design. We first transform the original problem into a low-complexity problem via the Lyapunov optimization. Then, we decompose the transformed problem into multiple subproblems and adopt the alternative optimization (AO) method to solve each subproblem. Specifically, we propose two efficient algorithms, i.e., the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and the low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm for optimizing transceiver beamformer. We adopt exhaustive search methods to solve the semantic actuation policy indicator optimization problem and the transmitted semantic symbol design problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can preserve more than 50\% of the original information under the same AoIS compared to the constrained baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

After engineers identify a bug-triggering test case in simulation-based hardware verification, they usually spend considerable time analyzing the execution trace to localize the bug. Although numerous automated hardware debugging techniques exist, they are not applicable to large designs and deep bugs. A primary reason for their limitations is that these techniques only utilize the information of a single bug-triggering test case for bug localization, which prevents them from effectively analyzing intricate hardware systems and figure out the root cause of bugs. To solve this problem, in this paper, we transform the hardware bug localization problem into a test generation problem, aiming to find a set of effective witness test cases beyond the initial bug-triggering test case to enhance hardware bug localization. Witness test cases refer to the cases that do not trigger the bug in the faulty design. By analyzing the execution differences between passing and failing test cases with spectrum-based method, we can eliminate innocent design statements and localize the buggy ones. To further refine the suspicious area, we define the criteria for effective witness test cases and use a mutation-based strategy to generate such test cases. Based on this approach, we propose an automated hardware bug localization framework named Wit-HW. We evaluate Wit-HW on 41 bugs from various hardware designs. The experimental results show that Wit-HW effectively localize 49%, 73%, 88% bugs within Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 ranks, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art bug localization techniques. Additionally, we evaluate Wit-HW on 13 real-world bugs collected from open-source hardware projects, showcasing the robust performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCAD'2025</p></details> |

However, none of the existing algorithms is backward stable, preventing them from being deployed as drop-in replacements for existing QR-based solvers. This paper introduces sketch-and-precondition with iterative refinement (SPIR) and FOSSILS, two provably backward stable randomized least-squares solvers. SPIR and FOSSILS combine iterative refinement with a preconditioned iterative method applied to the normal equations and converge at the same rate as existing randomized least-squares solvers. This work offers the promise of incorporating randomized least-squares solvers into existing software libraries while maintaining the same level of accuracy and stability as classical solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 6 figures; v3 revisions to improve presentation and clarity</p></details> |

We construct translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third, data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SCALR @ COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Repeating Words for Video-Language Retrieval with Coarse-to-Fine Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14812v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs, including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

In applications, however, it's often the case that sample sizes are data-dependent rather than predetermined. The aforementioned methods aren't reliable in this latter case, hence the recent interest in e-processes and methods that are anytime valid, i.e., reliable for any dynamic data-collection plan. But if the investigator has relevant-yet-incomplete prior information about the quantity of interest, then there's an opportunity for efficiency gain. This paper proposes a regularized e-process framework featuring a knowledge-based, imprecise-probabilistic regularization with improved efficiency. A generalized version of Ville's inequality is established, ensuring that inference based on the regularized e-process are anytime valid in a novel, knowledge-dependent sense. Regularized e-processes also facilitate possibility-theoretic uncertainty quantification with strong frequentist-like calibration properties and other Bayesian-like properties: satisfies the likelihood principle, avoids sure-loss, and offers formal decision-making with reliability guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments welcome (via email or) at https://researchers.one/articles/24.09.00003</p></details> |
| **[A likelihood-based Bayesian inference framework for the calibration of and selection between stochastic velocity-jump models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19292v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities. These tracking data can be used to calibrate mathematical models describing the motility of individual entities. The challenges in calibrating models for single-agent motion derive from the intrinsic characteristics of experimental data, collected at discrete time steps and with measurement noise. We consider motion of individual agents that can be described by velocity-jump models in one spatial dimension. These agents transition between a network of \textit{n} states, in which each state is associated with a fixed velocity and fixed rates of switching to every other state. Exploiting approximate solutions to the resultant stochastic process, we develop a Bayesian inference framework to calibrate these models to discrete-time noisy data. We first demonstrate that the framework can be used to effectively recover the model parameters of data simulated from two-state and three-state models. Finally, we explore the question of model selection first using simulated data and then using experimental data tracking mRNA transport inside \textit{Drosophila} neurons. Overall, our results demonstrate that the framework is effective and efficient in calibrating and selecting between velocity-jump models and it can be applied to a range of motion processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures SI: 21 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[From App Features to Explanation Needs: Analyzing Correlations and Predictive Potential](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03881v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In today's digitized world, software systems must support users in understanding both how to interact with a system and why certain behaviors occur. This study investigates whether explanation needs, classified from user reviews, can be predicted based on app properties, enabling early consideration during development and large-scale requirements mining. We analyzed a gold standard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app version, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses identified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation needs, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app version, number of reviews, and star ratings. Linear regression models showed limited predictive power, with no reliable forecasts across configurations. Validation on a manually labeled dataset of 495 reviews confirmed these findings. Categories such as Security & Privacy and System Behavior showed slightly higher predictive potential, while Interaction and User Interface remained most difficult to predict. Overall, our results highlight that explanation needs are highly context-dependent and cannot be precisely inferred from app metadata alone. Developers and requirements engineers should therefore supplement metadata analysis with direct user feedback to effectively design explainable and user-centered software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Workshop (REW 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Anomaly Detection for Capsule Endoscopy Using Ensemble Learning Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06039v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capsule endoscopy is a method to capture images of the gastrointestinal tract and screen for diseases which might remain hidden if investigated with standard endoscopes. Due to the limited size of a video capsule, embedding AI models directly into the capsule demands careful consideration of the model size and thus complicates anomaly detection in this field. Furthermore, the scarcity of available data in this domain poses an ongoing challenge to achieving effective anomaly detection. Thus, this work introduces an ensemble strategy to address this challenge in anomaly detection tasks in video capsule endoscopies, requiring only a small number of individual neural networks during both the training and inference phases. Ensemble learning combines the predictions of multiple independently trained neural networks. This has shown to be highly effective in enhancing both the accuracy and robustness of machine learning models. However, this comes at the cost of higher memory usage and increased computational effort, which quickly becomes prohibitive in many real-world applications. Instead of applying the same training algorithm to each individual network, we propose using various loss functions, drawn from the anomaly detection field, to train each network. The methods are validated on the two largest publicly available datasets for video capsule endoscopy images, the Galar and the Kvasir-Capsule dataset. We achieve an AUC score of 76.86% on the Kvasir-Capsule and an AUC score of 76.98% on the Galar dataset. Our approach outperforms current baselines with significantly fewer parameters across all models, which is a crucial step towards incorporating artificial intelligence into capsule endoscopies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS EMBC)</p></details> |
| **[HERAKLES: Hierarchical Skill Compilation for Open-ended LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14751v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over time.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Evaluating Multilingual and Code-Switched Alignment in LLMs via Synthetic Natural Language Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14735v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever for improving multilingual robustness.

| **[MAVIS: Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13415v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives -- such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The NordDRG AI Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13790v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being piloted for clinical coding and decision support, yet no open benchmark targets the hospital-funding layer where Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) determine reimbursement. In most OECD systems, DRGs route a substantial share of multi-trillion-dollar health spending through governed grouper software, making transparency and auditability first-order concerns. We release NordDRG-AI-Benchmark, the first public, rule-complete test bed for DRG reasoning. The package includes (i) machine-readable approximately 20-sheet NordDRG definition tables and (ii) expert manuals and change-log templates that capture governance workflows. It exposes two suites: a 13-task Logic benchmark (code lookup, cross-table inference, grouping features, multilingual terminology, and CC/MCC validity checks) and a 13-task Grouper benchmark that requires full DRG grouper emulation with strict exact-match scoring on both the DRG and the triggering drg_logic.id. Lightweight reference agents (LogicAgent, GrouperAgent) enable artefact-only evaluation. Under an artefact-only (no web) setting, on the 13 Logic tasks GPT-5 Thinking and Opus 4.1 score 13/13, o3 scores 12/13; mid-tier models (GPT-5 Thinking Mini, o4-mini, GPT-5 Fast) achieve 6-8/13, and remaining models score 5/13 or below. On full grouper emulation across 13 tasks, GPT-5 Thinking solves 7/13, o3 6/13, o4-mini 3/13; GPT-5 Thinking Mini solves 1/13, and all other tested endpoints score 0/13. To our knowledge, this is the first public report of an LLM partially emulating the complete NordDRG grouper logic with governance-grade traceability. Coupling a rule-complete release with exact-match tasks and open scoring provides a reproducible yardstick for head-to-head and longitudinal evaluation in hospital funding.

| **[Long-Context Speech Synthesis with Context-Aware Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14713v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-text speech synthesis, current approaches typically convert text to speech at the sentence-level and concatenate the results to form pseudo-paragraph-level speech. These methods overlook the contextual coherence of paragraphs, leading to reduced naturalness and inconsistencies in style and timbre across the long-form speech. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Memory (CAM)-based long-context Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. The CAM block integrates and retrieves both long-term memory and local context details, enabling dynamic memory updates and transfers within long paragraphs to guide sentence-level speech synthesis. Furthermore, the prefix mask enhances the in-context learning ability by enabling bidirectional attention on prefix tokens while maintaining unidirectional generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art long-context methods in terms of prosody expressiveness, coherence and context inference cost across paragraph-level speech.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech25</p></details> |

We assume that the follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives, is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025); Paper ID: M2635</p></details> |
| **[A Lightweight Incentive-Based Privacy-Preserving Smart Metering Protocol for Value-Added Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14703v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of smart grids and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) has revolutionized energy management. Unlike traditional power grids, smart grids benefit from two-way communication through AMI, which surpasses earlier automated meter reading (AMR). AMI enables diverse demand- and supply-side utilities such as accurate billing, outage detection, real-time grid control, load forecasting, and value-added services. Smart meters play a key role by delivering consumption values at predefined intervals to the utility provider (UP). However, such reports may raise privacy concerns, as adversaries can infer lifestyle patterns, political orientations, and the types of electrical devices in a household, or even sell the data to third parties (TP) such as insurers. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, privacy-preserving smart metering protocol for incentive-based value-added services. The scheme employs local differential privacy, hash chains, blind digital signatures, pseudonyms, temporal aggregation, and anonymous overlay networks to report coarse-grained values with adjustable granularity to the UP. This protects consumers' privacy while preserving data utility. The scheme prevents identity disclosure while enabling automatic token redemption. From a performance perspective, our results show that with a 1024-bit RSA key, a 7-day duration, and four reports per day, our protocol runs in approximately 0.51s and consumes about 4.5 MB of memory. From a privacy perspective, the protocol resists semi-trusted and untrusted adversaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 7 Figures, 6 Tables,</p></details> |

We observe that the pairwise matching paradigms applied to image set matching often result in ambiguous estimation when the selected independent pairs exhibit significant occlusions or extreme viewpoint changes. This challenge primarily stems from the inherent uncertainty in interpreting intricate 3D structures based on limited two-view observations, as the 3D-to-2D projection leads to significant information loss. To address this, we introduce CoMatcher, a deep multi-view matcher to (i) leverage complementary context cues from different views to form a holistic 3D scene understanding and (ii) utilize cross-view projection consistency to infer a reliable global solution. Building on CoMatcher, we develop a groupwise framework that fully exploits cross-view relationships for large-scale matching tasks. Extensive experiments on various complex scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method over the mainstream two-view matching paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, to be published in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Assessment of Power System Stability Considering Multiple Time-Scale Dynamics: Insights into Hopf Bifurcations in Presence of GFL and GFM IBRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14677v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models. When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Controllable Latent Space Augmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14588v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

Structured Thought-Action Sequences for Epistemic Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14564v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action'' examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.</p></details> | Accepted at ICSR25 |

By leveraging the principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2025 28th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)</p></details> |

A naive projection of the point cloud to the output view using 1x1 pixels is fast and retains the available detail, but also results in unintelligible renderings as background points leak in between the foreground pixels. The key insight is that these projections can be transformed into a realistic result using a deep convolutional model in the form of a U-Net, and a depth-based heuristic that prefilters the data. The U-Net also handles LiDAR-specific problems such as missing parts due to occlusion, color inconsistencies and varying point densities. We also describe a method to generate synthetic training data to deal with imperfectly-aligned ground truth images. Our method achieves real-time rendering rates using an off-the-shelf GPU and outperforms the state-of-the-art in both speed and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Eurographics 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05662v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success, recent reconstruction-based anomaly detection (AD) methods via diffusion modeling still involve fine-grained noise-strength tuning and computationally expensive multi-step denoising, leading to a fundamental tension between fidelity and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel inversion-based AD approach - detection via noising in latent space - which circumvents explicit reconstruction. Importantly, we contend that the limitations in prior reconstruction-based methods originate from the prevailing detection via denoising in RGB space paradigm. To address this, we model AD under a reconstruction-free formulation, which directly infers the final latent variable corresponding to the input image via DDIM inversion, and then measures the deviation based on the known prior distribution for anomaly scoring. Specifically, in approximating the original probability flow ODE using the Euler method, we only enforce very few inversion steps to noise the clean image to pursue inference efficiency. As the added noise is adaptively derived with the learned diffusion model, the original features for the clean testing image can still be leveraged to yield high detection accuracy. We perform extensive experiments and detailed analysis across three widely used image AD datasets under the unsupervised unified setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, regarding state-of-the-art AD performance, and about 2 times inference time speedup without diffusion distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/SkyShunsuke/InversionAD</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error (RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated verification of large-scale programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Position paper to appear in the 1st International Workshop on Language Models and Programming Languages (LMPL '25)</p></details> |
| **[Global-Distribution Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14493v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of e-commerce, the recommendations provided by commercial platforms must adapt to diverse scenarios to accommodate users' varying shopping preferences. Current methods typically use a unified framework to offer personalized recommendations for different scenarios. However, they often employ shared bottom representations, which partially hinders the model's capacity to capture scenario uniqueness. Ideally, users and items should exhibit specific characteristics in different scenarios, prompting the need to learn scenario-specific representations to differentiate scenarios. Yet, variations in user and item interactions across scenarios lead to data sparsity issues, impeding the acquisition of scenario-specific representations. To learn robust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR) that can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically, considering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs a probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user and item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI). Additionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions as prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item distributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin interests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of users or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios. Extensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting existing multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025, 6 pages, 1 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Approaches such as bridge sampling, while effective, may suffer from issues of high variability of the estimates. We present how to estimate Monte Carlo standard error (MCSE) for bridge sampling, and how to diagnose the reliability of MCSE estimates using Pareto-$\hat{k}$ and block reshuffling diagnostics without the need to repeatedly re-run full posterior inference. We demonstrate the behavior with increasingly more difficult simulated posteriors and many real posteriors from the posteriordb database.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Effective weed monitoring and analysis strategies are crucial for implementing sustainable agricultural practices and site-specific management approaches. We introduce WeedSense, a novel multi-task learning architecture for comprehensive weed analysis that jointly performs semantic segmentation, height estimation, and growth stage classification. We present a unique dataset capturing 16 weed species over an 11-week growth cycle with pixel-level annotations, height measurements, and temporal labels. WeedSense leverages a dual-path encoder incorporating Universal Inverted Bottleneck blocks and a Multi-Task Bifurcated Decoder with transformer-based feature fusion to generate multi-scale features and enable simultaneous prediction across multiple tasks. WeedSense outperforms other state-of-the-art models on our comprehensive evaluation. On our multi-task dataset, WeedSense achieves mIoU of 89.78% for segmentation, 1.67cm MAE for height estimation, and 99.99% accuracy for growth stage classification while maintaining real-time inference at 160 FPS. Our multitask approach achieves 3$\times$ faster inference than sequential single-task execution and uses 32.4% fewer parameters.

| **[The Man Behind the Sound: Demystifying Audio Private Attribute Profiling via Multimodal Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10016v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our research uncovers a novel privacy risk associated with multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the ability to infer sensitive personal attributes from audio data -- a technique we term audio private attribute profiling. This capability poses a significant threat, as audio can be covertly captured without direct interaction or visibility. Moreover, compared to images and text, audio carries unique characteristics, such as tone and pitch, which can be exploited for more detailed profiling. However, two key challenges exist in understanding MLLM-employed private attribute profiling from audio: (1) the lack of audio benchmark datasets with sensitive attribute annotations and (2) the limited ability of current MLLMs to infer such attributes directly from audio. To address these challenges, we introduce AP^2, an audio benchmark dataset that consists of two subsets collected and composed from real-world data, and both are annotated with sensitive attribute labels. Additionally, we propose Gifts, a hybrid multi-agent framework that leverages the complementary strengths of audio-language models (ALMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enhance inference capabilities. Gifts employs an LLM to guide the ALM in inferring sensitive attributes, then forensically analyzes and consolidates the ALM's inferences, overcoming severe hallucinations of existing ALMs in generating long-context responses. Our evaluations demonstrate that Gifts significantly outperforms baseline approaches in inferring sensitive attributes. Finally, we investigate model-level and data-level defense strategies to mitigate the risks of audio private attribute profiling. Our work validates the feasibility of audio-based privacy attacks using MLLMs, highlighting the need for robust defenses, and provides a dataset and framework to facilitate future research.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Consistent and Optimal Solution to Camera Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01174v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given 2D point correspondences between an image pair, inferring the camera motion is a fundamental issue in the computer vision community. The existing works generally set out from the epipolar constraint and estimate the essential matrix, which is not optimal in the maximum likelihood (ML) sense. In this paper, we dive into the original measurement model with respect to the rotation matrix and normalized translation vector and formulate the ML problem. We then propose a two-step algorithm to solve it: In the first step, we estimate the variance of measurement noises and devise a consistent estimator based on bias elimination; In the second step, we execute a one-step Gauss-Newton iteration on manifold to refine the consistent estimate. We prove that the proposed estimate owns the same asymptotic statistical properties as the ML estimate: The first is consistency, i.e., the estimate converges to the ground truth as the point number increases; The second is asymptotic efficiency, i.e., the mean squared error of the estimate converges to the theoretical lower bound -- Cramer-Rao bound. In addition, we show that our algorithm has linear time complexity. These appealing characteristics endow our estimator with a great advantage in the case of dense point correspondences. Experiments on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate that when the point number reaches the order of hundreds, our estimator outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of estimation accuracy and CPU time.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods. We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

DuPO addresses two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g., translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information (e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically, DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks, and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures, |
| **[Inequality Restricted Minimum Density Power Divergence Estimation in Panel Count Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21534v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysis of panel count data has garnered a considerable amount of attention in the literature, leading to the development of multiple statistical techniques. In inferential analysis, most of the works focus on leveraging estimating equations-based techniques or conventional maximum likelihood estimation. However, the robustness of these methods is largely questionable. In this paper, we present the robust density power divergence estimation for panel count data arising from nonhomogeneous Poisson processes, correlated through a latent frailty variable. In order to cope with real-world incidents, it is often desired to impose certain inequality constraints on the parameter space, giving rise to the restricted minimum density power divergence estimator. The significant contribution of this study lies in deriving its asymptotic properties. The proposed method ensures high efficiency in the model estimation while providing reliable inference despite data contamination. Moreover, the density power divergence measure is governed by a tuning parameter $\gamma$, which controls the trade-off between robustness and efficiency. To effectively determine the optimal value of $\gamma$, this study employs a generalized score-matching technique, marking considerable progress in the data analysis. Simulation studies and real data examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the estimator and to substantiate the theory developed.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 Pa...</summary><p>58 Pages, 12 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |

In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[Online Incident Response Planning under Model Misspecification through Bayesian Learning and Belief Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14385v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL: Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available, which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and robustness to model misspecification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CCS AISec2025</p></details> |

Through a combination of flow matching and targeted system-level and architectural optimizations, 3DFA achieves over 30x faster training and inference than previous 3D diffusion-based policies, without sacrificing performance. On the bimanual PerAct2 benchmark, it establishes a new state of the art, outperforming the next-best method by an absolute margin of 41.4%. In extensive real-world evaluations, it surpasses strong baselines with up to 1000x more parameters and significantly more pretraining. In unimanual settings, it sets a new state of the art on 74 RLBench tasks by directly predicting dense end-effector trajectories, eliminating the need for motion planning. Comprehensive ablation studies underscore the importance of our design choices for both policy effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://3d-flowmatch-actor.github.io/</p></details> |

We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate, university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i) selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3 orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to catalyze future research.

The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to BMC Medical Research Methodology</p></details> |
| **[The Kikuchi Hierarchy and Tensor PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03858v3)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the tensor PCA (principal component analysis) problem, we propose a new hierarchy of increasingly powerful algorithms with increasing runtime. Our hierarchy is analogous to the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy but is instead inspired by statistical physics and related algorithms such as belief propagation and AMP (approximate message passing). Our level-$\ell$ algorithm can be thought of as a linearized message-passing algorithm that keeps track of $\ell$-wise dependencies among the hidden variables. Specifically, our algorithms are spectral methods based on the Kikuchi Hessian, which generalizes the well-studied Bethe Hessian to the higher-order Kikuchi free energies. It is known that AMP, the flagship algorithm of statistical physics, has substantially worse performance than SOS for tensor PCA. In this work we 'redeem' the statistical physics approach by showing that our hierarchy gives a polynomial-time algorithm matching the performance of SOS. Our hierarchy also yields a continuum of subexponential-time algorithms, and we prove that these achieve the same (conjecturally optimal) tradeoff between runtime and statistical power as SOS. Our proofs are much simpler than prior work, and also apply to the related problem of refuting random $k$-XOR formulas. The results we present here apply to tensor PCA for tensors of all orders, and to $k$-XOR when $k$ is even. Our methods suggest a new avenue for systematically obtaining optimal algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, and our results constitute a step toward unifying the statistical physics and sum-of-squares approaches to algorithm design.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages. v3 is the journal version, appearing in Journal of the ACM</p></details> |

A common goal in human microbiome research is identifying subgroups of individuals with similar microbial composition that may be linked to specific health states or environmental exposures. However, existing clustering methods are often not equipped to accommodate the complex structure of microbiome data and typically make limiting assumptions regarding the number of clusters in the data which can bias inference. Designed for zero-inflated multivariate compositional count data collected in microbiome research, we propose a novel Bayesian semiparametric mixture modeling framework that simultaneously learns the number of clusters in the data while performing cluster allocation. In simulation, we demonstrate the clustering performance of our method compared to distance- and model-based alternatives and the importance of accommodating zero-inflation when present in the data. We then apply the model to identify clusters in microbiome data collected in a study designed to investigate the relation between gut microbial composition and enteric diarrheal disease.</p></details> | 25 pages, 3 figures |

While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type, model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and resource efficiency in NLP applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Key r...</summary><p>Key results in Figure 1, submitted to Nature Communications, 25 pages</p></details> |

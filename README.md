We introduce AdaHuman, a novel framework that generates high-fidelity animatable 3D avatars from a single in-the-wild image. AdaHuman incorporates two key innovations: (1) A pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes consistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step; (2) A compositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body parts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a novel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar. These components allow AdaHuman to generate highly realistic standardized A-pose avatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any input motion. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images demonstrates that AdaHuman significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both avatar reconstruction and reposing. Code and models will be publicly available for research purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://nvlabs.github.io/AdaHuman</p></details> |
| **[The Road to Generalizable Neuro-Symbolic Learning Should be Paved with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24874v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuro-symbolic learning was proposed to address challenges with training neural networks for complex reasoning tasks with the added benefits of interpretability, reliability, and efficiency. Neuro-symbolic learning methods traditionally train neural models in conjunction with symbolic programs, but they face significant challenges that limit them to simplistic problems. On the other hand, purely-neural foundation models now reach state-of-the-art performance through prompting rather than training, but they are often unreliable and lack interpretability. Supplementing foundation models with symbolic programs, which we call neuro-symbolic prompting, provides a way to use these models for complex reasoning tasks. Doing so raises the question: What role does specialized model training as part of neuro-symbolic learning have in the age of foundation models? To explore this question, we highlight three pitfalls of traditional neuro-symbolic learning with respect to the compute, data, and programs leading to generalization problems. This position paper argues that foundation models enable generalizable neuro-symbolic solutions, offering a path towards achieving the original goals of neuro-symbolic learning without the downsides of training from scratch.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such, training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets, highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture. Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24% compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://modomodo-rl.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Consistent line clustering using geometric hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24868v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional data analysis often represents data as a weighted graph with pairwise similarities, but many problems do not naturally fit this framework. In line clustering, points in a Euclidean space must be grouped so that each cluster is well approximated by a line segment. Since any two points define a line, pairwise similarities fail to capture the structure of the problem, necessitating the use of higher-order interactions modeled by geometric hypergraphs. We encode geometry into a 3-uniform hypergraph by treating sets of three points as hyperedges whenever they are approximately collinear. The resulting hypergraph contains information about the underlying line segments, which can then be extracted using community recovery algorithms. In contrast to classical hypergraph block models, latent geometric constraints in this construction introduce significant dependencies between hyperedges, which restricts the applicability of many standard theoretical tools. We aim to determine the fundamental limits of line clustering and evaluate hypergraph-based line clustering methods. To this end, we derive information-theoretic thresholds for exact and almost exact recovery for data generated from intersecting lines on a plane with additive Gaussian noise. We develop a polynomial-time spectral algorithm and show that it succeeds under noise conditions that match the information-theoretic bounds up to a polylogarithmic factor.</p></details> | 40 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Time Blindness: Why Video-Language Models Can't See What Humans Can?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24867v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made impressive strides in understanding spatio-temporal relationships in videos. However, when spatial information is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal patterns. We introduce $\textbf{SpookyBench}$, a benchmark where information is encoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural phenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly, while humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with over 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance gap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial features and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore, when trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), temporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception, especially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this limitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple spatial dependencies from temporal processing. Our systematic analysis shows that this issue persists across model scales and architectures. We release SpookyBench to catalyze research in temporal pattern recognition and bridge the gap between human and machine video understanding. Dataset and code has been made available on our project website: https://timeblindness.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://timeblindness.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ProRL: Prolonged Reinforcement Learning Expands Reasoning Boundaries in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24864v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL) training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning. We release model weights to support further research: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B</p></details> | 26 pages, 17 figures |

To further enhance the performance of story visualization frameworks in real-world scenarios, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, ViStoryBench. We collect a diverse dataset encompassing various story types and artistic styles, ensuring models are evaluated across multiple dimensions such as different plots (e.g., comedy, horror) and visual aesthetics (e.g., anime, 3D renderings). ViStoryBench is carefully curated to balance narrative structures and visual elements, featuring stories with single and multiple protagonists to test models' ability to maintain character consistency. Additionally, it includes complex plots and intricate world-building to challenge models in generating accurate visuals. To ensure comprehensive comparisons, our benchmark incorporates a wide range of evaluation metrics assessing critical aspects. This structured and multifaceted framework enables researchers to thoroughly identify both the strengths and weaknesses of different models, fostering targeted improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 Pa...</summary><p>33 Pages, Project Page: https://vistorybench.github.io/, Code: https://github.com/vistorybench/vistorybench</p></details> |
| **[V2SFlow: Video-to-Speech Generation with Speech Decomposition and Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19486v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce V2SFlow, a novel Video-to-Speech (V2S) framework designed to generate natural and intelligible speech directly from silent talking face videos. While recent V2S systems have shown promising results on constrained datasets with limited speakers and vocabularies, their performance often degrades on real-world, unconstrained datasets due to the inherent variability and complexity of speech signals. To address these challenges, we decompose the speech signal into manageable subspaces (content, pitch, and speaker information), each representing distinct speech attributes, and predict them directly from the visual input. To generate coherent and realistic speech from these predicted attributes, we employ a rectified flow matching decoder built on a Transformer architecture, which models efficient probabilistic pathways from random noise to the target speech distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2SFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even surpassing the naturalness of ground truth utterances.

| **[PB&J: Peanut Butter and Joints for Damped Articulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24860v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many bioinspired robots mimic the rigid articulated joint structure of the human hand for grasping tasks, but experience high-frequency mechanical perturbations that can destabilize the system and negatively affect precision without a high-frequency controller. Despite having bandwidth-limited controllers that experience time delays between sensing and actuation, biological systems can respond successfully to and mitigate these high-frequency perturbations. Human joints include damping and stiffness that many rigid articulated bioinspired hand robots lack. To enable researchers to explore the effects of joint viscoelasticity in joint control, we developed a human-hand-inspired grasping robot with viscoelastic structures that utilizes accessible and bioderived materials to reduce the economic and environmental impact of prototyping novel robotic systems. We demonstrate that an elastic element at the finger joints is necessary to achieve concurrent flexion, which enables secure grasping of spherical objects. To significantly damp the manufactured finger joints, we modeled, manufactured, and characterized rotary dampers using peanut butter as an organic analog joint working fluid. Finally, we demonstrated that a real-time position-based controller could be used to successfully catch a lightweight falling ball. We developed this open-source, low-cost grasping platform that abstracts the morphological and mechanical properties of the human hand to enable researchers to explore questions about biomechanics in roboto that would otherwise be difficult to test in simulation or modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in Living Machines 2025 Proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Multiple Choice: Evaluating Steering Vectors for Adaptive Free-Form Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24859v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far, steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings, while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied. Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 21 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Binarized Neural Networks Converge Toward Algorithmic Simplicity: Empirical Support for the Learning-as-Compression Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20646v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages total, 1 figure.

| **[LlamaDuo: LLMOps Pipeline for Seamless Migration from Service LLMs to Small-Scale Local LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13467v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is automatically improved through additional fine-tuning using extra similar data generated by the service LLM. This multi-turn process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments. Extensive experiments with leading-edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various downstream tasks. Our pipeline implementation is available at https://github.com/deep-diver/llamaduo.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work; Accepted by ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Chameleon: A MatMul-Free Temporal Convolutional Network Accelerator for End-to-End Few-Shot and Continual Learning from Sequential Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24852v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device learning at the edge enables low-latency, private personalization with improved long-term robustness and reduced maintenance costs. Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way 5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots), while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Harnessing Negative Signals: Reinforcement Distillation from Teacher Data for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24850v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However, standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1). Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models post-trained offline with openly available data.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Statistical mechanics of extensive-width Bayesian neural networks near interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24849v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g., perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms, possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages + appendices, 12 figures.

| **[MSVCOD:A Large-Scale Multi-Scene Dataset for Video Camouflage Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13859v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Camouflaged Object Detection (VCOD) is a challenging task which aims to identify objects that seamlessly concealed within the background in videos. The dynamic properties of video enable detection of camouflaged objects through motion cues or varied perspectives. Previous VCOD datasets primarily contain animal objects, limiting the scope of research to wildlife scenarios. However, the applications of VCOD extend beyond wildlife and have significant implications in security, art, and medical fields. Addressing this problem, we construct a new large-scale multi-domain VCOD dataset MSVCOD. To achieve high-quality annotations, we design a semi-automatic iterative annotation pipeline that reduces costs while maintaining annotation accuracy. Our MSVCOD is the largest VCOD dataset to date, introducing multiple object categories including human, animal, medical, and vehicle objects for the first time, while also expanding background diversity across various environments. This expanded scope increases the practical applicability of the VCOD task in camouflaged object detection. Alongside this dataset, we introduce a one-steam video camouflage object detection model that performs both feature extraction and information fusion without additional motion feature fusion modules. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the existing VCOD animal dataset and the proposed MSVCOD. The dataset and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Covering three practical domains -- airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations -- RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. We also observe a significant performance boost when LLMs are provided with external tools for oracle math and logic operations. These results highlight significant challenges and promising research directions in advancing LLMs' rule-guided reasoning capabilities in real-life applications.

| **[Chameleon: A Flexible Data-mixing Framework for Language Model Pretraining and Finetuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24844v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training data mixtures greatly impact the generalization performance of large language models. Existing domain reweighting methods often rely on costly weight computations and require retraining when new data is introduced. To this end, we introduce a flexible and efficient data mixing framework, Chameleon, that employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned embedding space. We first construct a domain affinity matrix over domain embeddings. The induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights domains sharing common representations in embedding space. This formulation allows direct transfer to new data by computing the new domain embeddings. In experiments, we demonstrate improvements over three key scenarios: (i) our computed weights improve performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of the compute of existing methods; (ii) Chameleon can adapt to data changes without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when transferred to new data; (iii) our method enables efficient domain reweighting in finetuning, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains over uniform mixture. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Chameleon.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Vision LLMs Are Bad at Hierarchical Visual Understanding, and LLMs Are the Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24840v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy knowledge.</p></details> | 28 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Zero-Shot Chinese Character Recognition with Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Image-Text Aligning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24837v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chinese Character Recognition (CCR) is a fundamental technology for intelligent document processing. Unlike Latin characters, Chinese characters exhibit unique spatial structures and compositional rules, allowing for the use of fine-grained semantic information in representation. However, existing approaches are usually based on auto-regressive as well as edit distance post-process and typically rely on a single-level character representation. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Image-Text Aligning (Hi-GITA) framework based on a contrastive paradigm. To leverage the abundant fine-grained semantic information of Chinese characters, we propose multi-granularity encoders on both image and text sides. Specifically, the Image Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts hierarchical image representations from character images, capturing semantic cues from localized strokes to holistic structures. The Text Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts stroke and radical sequence representations at different levels of granularity. To better capture the relationships between strokes and radicals, we introduce Multi-Granularity Fusion Modules on the image and text sides, respectively. Furthermore, to effectively bridge the two modalities, we further introduce a Fine-Grained Decoupled Image-Text Contrastive loss, which aligns image and text representations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed Hi-GITA significantly outperforms existing zero-shot CCR methods. For instance, it brings about 20% accuracy improvement in handwritten character and radical zero-shot settings. Code and models will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally</p></details> |

Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02355v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is a powerful tool for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, but the accuracy-performance trade-offs across different formats remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct the most comprehensive empirical study to date, evaluating FP8, INT8, and INT4 quantization across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Through over 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1) FP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned INT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\%) accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit quantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for different deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular vLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16 is the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in asynchronous continuous batching. For mixed workloads, the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Our findings offer practical, data-driven guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs at scale -- ensuring the best balance between speed, efficiency, and accuracy.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[Timing is important: Risk-aware Fund Allocation based on Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24835v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate (RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models. Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments.

In this work, we challenge this assumption in the context of two underexplored, sense-aware tasks: polysemy disambiguation and lexical semantic change. Through a large-scale analysis across 28 languages, we show that multilingual training is neither necessary nor inherently beneficial for effective transfer. Instead, we find that confounding factors - such as fine-tuning data composition and evaluation artifacts - better account for the perceived advantages of multilinguality. Our findings call for more rigorous evaluations in multilingual NLP. We release fine-tuned models and benchmarks to support further research, with implications extending to low-resource and typologically diverse languages.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Building Superior Neural Architectures by Preserving N-D Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many high-impact machine learning tasks involve multi-dimensional data such as images, volumetric medical scans, and multivariate time-series. Yet, most neural architectures flatten these inputs, discarding critical cross-dimension information. We introduce $\textbf{NdLinear}$, a novel linear transformation that circumvents this destructive flattening by operating directly on tensors. NdLinear applies transformations separately along each data dimension, thereby preserving the native data structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity to significantly enhance representational power, achieve dramatic parameter reductions (often by orders of magnitude), and maintain a favorable computational profile. For instance, when applied to Large Language Model finetuning, our $\textbf{NdLinear-LoRA}$ delivers comparable or improved accuracy on reasoning tasks using up to $9\times$ fewer trainable parameters than standard LoRA. These broad advantages of NdLinear are consistently validated across diverse neural architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, MLPs) and data domains, including vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks. As a versatile, drop-in replacement for standard linear layers, NdLinear processes data in its original N-dimensional form, offering a foundational component for developing more efficient and powerful next-generation neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ensemble-core/NdLinear</p></details> |

Current methods, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and explainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications. This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

To address this gap, we propose three steps: First, we develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on clarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of legal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework. Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off at 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\%$ noted at 72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and context length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical significance thresholds above 0.016. Third, reasoning models consistently outperform base architectures. A significant outcome of our research is the release of a ranking list and Pareto analysis, which highlight the Qwen3 series as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs. This work not only establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs but also uncovers fundamental limitations in current training data refinement approaches.

Deep learning methods have shown promising results in segmenting historical maps, but publicly available datasets typically focus on a single map type or period, require extensive and costly annotations, and are not suited for nationwide, long-term analyses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset of historical maps tailored for analyzing large-scale, long-term land use and land cover evolution with limited annotations. Spanning metropolitan France (548,305 km^2), our dataset contains three map collections from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. We provide both comprehensive modern labels and 22,878 km^2 of manually annotated historical labels for the 18th and 19th century maps. Our dataset illustrates the complexity of the segmentation task, featuring stylistic inconsistencies, interpretive ambiguities, and significant landscape changes (e.g., marshlands disappearing in favor of forests). We assess the difficulty of these challenges by benchmarking three approaches: a fully-supervised model trained with historical labels, and two weakly-supervised models that rely only on modern annotations. The latter either use the modern labels directly or first perform image-to-image translation to address the stylistic gap between historical and contemporary maps. Finally, we discuss how these methods can support long-term environment monitoring, offering insights into centuries of landscape transformation.

Traditional ASR-based KWS methods, such as greedy and beam search, explore the entire search space without explicitly prioritizing keyword detection, often leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an effective keyword-specific KWS framework by introducing a streaming-oriented CTC-Transducer-combined frame-asynchronous system with multi-head frame-asynchronous decoding (MFA-KWS). Specifically, MFA-KWS employs keyword-specific phone-synchronous decoding for CTC and replaces conventional RNN-T with Token-and-Duration Transducer to enhance both performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we explore various score fusion strategies, including single-frame-based and consistency-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of MFA-KWS, which achieves state-of-the-art results on both fixed keyword and arbitrary keywords datasets, such as Snips, MobvoiHotwords, and LibriKWS-20, while exhibiting strong robustness in noisy environments. Among fusion strategies, the consistency-based CDC-Last method delivers the best performance. Additionally, MFA-KWS achieves a 47% to 63% speed-up over the frame-synchronous baselines across various datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm that MFA-KWS is an effective and efficient KWS framework, making it well-suited for on-device deployment.</p></details> | TASLP under review |

We address this gap with FAME, a dataset of 500 meetings in English and 300 in German produced by MIMIC, our new multi-agent meeting synthesis framework that generates meeting transcripts on a given knowledge source by defining psychologically grounded participant profiles, outlining the conversation, and orchestrating a large language model (LLM) debate. A modular post-processing step refines these outputs, mitigating potential repetitiveness and overly formal tones, ensuring coherent, credible dialogues at scale. We also propose a psychologically grounded evaluation framework assessing naturalness, social behavior authenticity, and transcript difficulties. Human assessments show that FAME approximates real-meeting spontaneity (4.5/5 in naturalness), preserves speaker-centric challenges (3/5 in spoken language), and introduces richer information-oriented difficulty (4/5 in difficulty). These findings highlight that FAME is a good and scalable proxy for real-world meeting conditions. It enables new test scenarios for meeting summarization research and other conversation-centric applications in tasks requiring conversation data or simulating social scenarios under behavioral constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/dannigt/mid-align).</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have shown remarkable performance in rehearsal-free CIL without requiring exemplars from previous tasks. However, existing adapter-based methods, which incorporate lightweight learnable modules into PTMs for CIL, create new adapters for each new task, leading to both parameter redundancy and failure to leverage shared knowledge across tasks. In this work, we propose ContinuaL Low-Rank Adaptation (CL-LoRA), which introduces a novel dual-adapter architecture combining \textbf{task-shared adapters} to learn cross-task knowledge and \textbf{task-specific adapters} to capture unique features of each new task. Specifically, the shared adapters utilize random orthogonal matrices and leverage knowledge distillation with gradient reassignment to preserve essential shared knowledge. In addition, we introduce learnable block-wise weights for task-specific adapters, which mitigate inter-task interference while maintaining the model's plasticity. We demonstrate CL-LoRA consistently achieves promising performance under multiple benchmarks with reduced training and inference computation, establishing a more efficient and scalable paradigm for continual learning with pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While most existing AI safety benchmarks focus on single modality misinformation (i.e., false content shared without intent to deceive), intentional multimodal disinformation, such as propaganda or conspiracy theories that imitate credible news, remains largely unaddressed. We introduce the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark (VLDBench), the first large-scale resource supporting both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) disinformation detection. VLDBench comprises approximately 62,000 labeled text-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 news outlets. Using a semi-automated pipeline followed by expert review, 22 domain experts invested over 500 hours to produce high-quality annotations with substantial inter-annotator agreement. Evaluations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on VLDBench show that incorporating visual cues improves detection accuracy by 5 to 35 percentage points over text-only models. VLDBench provides data and code for evaluation, fine-tuning, and robustness testing to support disinformation analysis. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks (e.g., the MIT AI Risk Repository), VLDBench offers a principled foundation for advancing trustworthy disinformation detection in multimodal media.

Existing methods often rely on explicit demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI) module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness metrics by over 28% with less than a 2% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the unsupervised IDI yields more than a 4.6% improvement in fairness metrics with a drop of less than 3.6% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating its potential when explicit demographic information is unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by InterSpeech 2025. 7 pages including 2 pages of appendix</p></details> |

A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference. Further, we measure latency to show that our method can attain over 45\% end-to-end % and over 92\% self-attention latency reduction on an H100 GPU at negligible overhead cost.

In this paper, we propose a coordinated beamforming framework for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered ISAC system, where the active precoding at the dual-functional base station (DFBS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS are jointly optimized to provide communication services for legitimate unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while sensing the unauthorized UAVs. The sum-rate of all legitimate UAVs are maximized, while satisfying the radar sensing signal-to-noise ratio requirements, the transmit power constraints, and the reflection coefficients of the RIS. To address the inherent non-convexity from coupled variables, we propose a low-complexity algorithm integrating fractional programming with alternating optimization, featuring convergence guarantees. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher data rate compared to disjoint optimization benchmarks. This underscores RIS's pivotal role in harmonizing communication and target sensing functionalities for low-altitude networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to the IEEE</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in reducing hallucinations in text generation; however, the use of structured data to support generative storytelling remains underexplored. This paper investigates how knowledge graphs (KGs) can enhance LLM-based storytelling by improving narrative quality and enabling user-driven modifications. We propose a KG-assisted storytelling pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study with 15 participants. Participants created their own story prompts, generated stories, and edited knowledge graphs to shape their narratives. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, our findings demonstrate that knowledge graphs significantly enhance story quality in action-oriented and structured narratives within our system settings. Additionally, editing the knowledge graph increases users' sense of control, making storytelling more engaging, interactive, and playful.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted for peer review in January 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder achieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of code-centric approaches in tool learning.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |

Motivated by this, we propose an accurate and fast algorithm named AFIRE to address such problem in the case of mildly full scan. We discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on the insights, the AFIRE is proposed respectively from the continuous, discrete and actual-use perspectives by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistency dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 15 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Detection of CRC at early stages is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. However, colonoscopy is dependent on obtaining adequate and high-quality endoscopic images. Prolonged invasive procedures are inherently risky for patients, while suboptimal or insufficient images hamper diagnostic accuracy. These images, typically derived from video frames, often exhibit similar patterns, posing challenges in discrimination. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Deep Learning network built on a Few-Shot Learning architecture, which includes a tailored feature extractor, task interpolation, relational embedding, and a bi-level routing attention mechanism. The Few-Shot Learning paradigm enables our model to rapidly adapt to unseen fine-grained endoscopic image patterns, and the task interpolation augments the insufficient images artificially from varied instrument viewpoints. Our relational embedding approach discerns critical intra-image features and captures inter-image transitions between consecutive endoscopic frames, overcoming the limitations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The integration of a light-weight attention mechanism ensures a concentrated analysis of pertinent image regions. By training on diverse datasets, the model's generalizability and robustness are notably improved for handling endoscopic images. Evaluated on Kvasir dataset, our model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.1\%, precision of 0.845, recall of 0.942, and an F1 score of 0.891. This surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, presenting a promising solution to the challenges of invasive colonoscopy by optimizing CRC detection through advanced image analysis.</p></details> | 6 pages, 15 figures |

While recent studies have achieved remarkable advancements, their training demands substantial time and computational costs, largely due to the implicit guidance of diffusion models in learning complex intermediate representations. To address this, we propose A-DMA, an effective strategy for Accelerating training with Dual Modality Alignment. Our method introduces a novel alignment pipeline leveraging both text and speech modalities: text-guided alignment, which incorporates contextual representations, and speech-guided alignment, which refines semantic representations. By aligning hidden states with discriminative features, our training scheme reduces the reliance on diffusion models for learning complex representations.

We present SAGI, a Systematic Approach to AGI that utilizes system design principles to overcome the energy wall and alignment challenges. This paper asserts that AGI can be realized through multiplicity of design specific pathways and customized through system design rather than a singular overarching architecture. AGI systems may exhibit diver architectural configurations and capabilities, contingent upon their intended use cases. Alignment, a challenge broadly recognized as AIs most formidable, is the one that depends most critically on system design and serves as its primary driving force as a foundational criterion for AGI. Capturing the complexities of human morality for alignment requires architectural support to represent the intricacies of moral decision-making and the pervasive ethical processing at every level, with performance reliability exceeding that of human moral judgment. Hence, requiring a more robust architecture towards safety and alignment goals, without replicating or resembling the human brain. We argue that system design (such as feedback loops, energy and performance optimization) on learning substrates (capable of learning its system architecture) is more fundamental to achieving AGI goals and guarantees, superseding classical symbolic, emergentist and hybrid approaches. Through learning of the system architecture itself, the resulting AGI is not a product of spontaneous emergence but of systematic design and deliberate engineering, with core features, including an integrated moral architecture, deeply embedded within its architecture. The approach aims to guarantee design goals such as alignment, efficiency by self-learning system architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Categ...</summary><p>Categories: Artificial Intelligence; AI; Artificial General Intelligence; AGI; System Design; System Architecture Preprint International Journal on Semantic Computing Vol. 18, No. 03, pp. 465-500</p></details> |

Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout" also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings; 5 pages, 2 figures, 4 pages of appendix</p></details> |

Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to short-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust assistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach designed specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture recognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly improving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware Gesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable Alignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust processing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging conditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and dynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive environments. We further introduce the Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL), shown to enhance learning and strengthen model robustness across varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks, achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.3% on a diverse dataset with challenging hyper-range gestures. By effectively interpreting gestures from considerable distances, DiG-Net significantly enhances the usability of assistive robots in home healthcare, industrial safety, and remote assistance scenarios, enabling seamless and intuitive interactions for users regardless of physical limitations</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18413</p></details> |

While recent V2S systems have shown promising results on constrained datasets with limited speakers and vocabularies, their performance often degrades on real-world, unconstrained datasets due to the inherent variability and complexity of speech signals. To address these challenges, we decompose the speech signal into manageable subspaces (content, pitch, and speaker information), each representing distinct speech attributes, and predict them directly from the visual input. To generate coherent and realistic speech from these predicted attributes, we employ a rectified flow matching decoder built on a Transformer architecture, which models efficient probabilistic pathways from random noise to the target speech distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2SFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, even surpassing the naturalness of ground truth utterances.

While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages total, 1 figure.

Building Superior Neural Architectures by Preserving N-D Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17353v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many high-impact machine learning tasks involve multi-dimensional data such as images, volumetric medical scans, and multivariate time-series. Yet, most neural architectures flatten these inputs, discarding critical cross-dimension information. We introduce $\textbf{NdLinear}$, a novel linear transformation that circumvents this destructive flattening by operating directly on tensors. NdLinear applies transformations separately along each data dimension, thereby preserving the native data structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate NdLinear's capacity to significantly enhance representational power, achieve dramatic parameter reductions (often by orders of magnitude), and maintain a favorable computational profile. For instance, when applied to Large Language Model finetuning, our $\textbf{NdLinear-LoRA}$ delivers comparable or improved accuracy on reasoning tasks using up to $9\times$ fewer trainable parameters than standard LoRA. These broad advantages of NdLinear are consistently validated across diverse neural architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, MLPs) and data domains, including vision, language, time-series, and tabular tasks. As a versatile, drop-in replacement for standard linear layers, NdLinear processes data in its original N-dimensional form, offering a foundational component for developing more efficient and powerful next-generation neural architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/ensemble-core/NdLinear</p></details> |
| **[Segmenting France Across Four Centuries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24824v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical maps offer an invaluable perspective into territory evolution across past centuries--long before satellite or remote sensing technologies existed. Deep learning methods have shown promising results in segmenting historical maps, but publicly available datasets typically focus on a single map type or period, require extensive and costly annotations, and are not suited for nationwide, long-term analyses. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset of historical maps tailored for analyzing large-scale, long-term land use and land cover evolution with limited annotations. Spanning metropolitan France (548,305 km^2), our dataset contains three map collections from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. We provide both comprehensive modern labels and 22,878 km^2 of manually annotated historical labels for the 18th and 19th century maps. Our dataset illustrates the complexity of the segmentation task, featuring stylistic inconsistencies, interpretive ambiguities, and significant landscape changes (e.g., marshlands disappearing in favor of forests). We assess the difficulty of these challenges by benchmarking three approaches: a fully-supervised model trained with historical labels, and two weakly-supervised models that rely only on modern annotations. The latter either use the modern labels directly or first perform image-to-image translation to address the stylistic gap between historical and contemporary maps. Finally, we discuss how these methods can support long-term environment monitoring, offering insights into centuries of landscape transformation.

A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference. Further, we measure latency to show that our method can attain over 45\% end-to-end % and over 92\% self-attention latency reduction on an H100 GPU at negligible overhead cost.

Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder achieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of code-centric approaches in tool learning.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |

This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands Tensor Core (TCU) applicability for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms tightly coupled with rendering pipeline designs, like Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thus reaching up to a total 5.6x acceleration.

Motivated by this, we propose an accurate and fast algorithm named AFIRE to address such problem in the case of mildly full scan. We discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on the insights, the AFIRE is proposed respectively from the continuous, discrete and actual-use perspectives by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistency dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 15 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Despite recent advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods while achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300x in real-time processing on large-scale datasets.

We combine recent architectural improvements of diffusion transformers with adjustments specific for large-scale simulations to yield a more scalable and versatile general-purpose transformer architecture, which can be used as the backbone for building large-scale foundation models in physical sciences. We demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art transformer architectures for computer vision on a large dataset of 16 different types of PDEs. We propose to embed different physical channels individually as spatio-temporal tokens, which interact via channel-wise self-attention. This helps to maintain a consistent information density of tokens when learning multiple types of PDEs simultaneously.

Foundation models mitigate this burden by leveraging self-supervised pretraining; however, the scarcity of open-weight ECG foundation models hinders adoption and cross-study comparability. We present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a study using a dataset of 1.5 million ECGs. ECG-FM is a transformer-based model pretrained using a hybrid contrastive and generative self-supervised learning approach. Our downstream tasks include predicting reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ECG interpretation labels, where we release a benchmark task on the MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset. We affirm that ECG-FM is robust, label-efficient, and functionally discriminative by showcasing data scaling experiments, performing a latent space analysis, and generating saliency maps. ECG-FM markedly outperforms task-specific models in the small-to-medium-scale data regime and demonstrates cross-dataset generalizability, achieving high AUROC on many clinically salient labels such as atrial fibrillation (0.996) and LVEF<=40% (0.929).

This trend has led to longer prompts, which improve LLMs' performance but increase data transmission costs and require more processing time, thereby reducing overall system efficiency and negatively impacting user experience. To address these challenges, we propose Joint Prompt and Power Optimization (JPPO), a framework that jointly optimizes prompt compression and wireless transmission power for mobile LLM services. JPPO leverages a Small Language Model (SLM) deployed at edge devices to perform lightweight prompt compression, reducing communication load before transmission to the cloud-based LLM. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent dynamically adjusts both the compression ratio and transmission power based on network conditions and service constraints, aiming to minimize service time while preserving response fidelity. We further extend the framework to JPPO++, which introduces a denoising-inspired compression scheme. This design performs iterative prompt refinement by progressively removing less informative tokens, allowing for more aggressive yet controlled compression. Experimental results show that JPPO++ reduces service time by 17% compared to the no-compression baseline while maintaining output quality. Under compression-prioritized settings, a reduction of up to 16x in prompt length can be achieved with an acceptable loss in accuracy. Specifically, JPPO with a 16x ratio reduces total service time by approximately 42.3%, and JPPO++ further improves this reduction to 46.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |

Pretokenization, often reliant on complex regular expressions, can also introduce fragility and unexpected edge cases. We propose SCRIPT (Script Category Representation in PreTokenization), a novel encoding scheme that bypasses UTF-8 byte conversion by using initial tokens based on Unicode script and category properties. This approach enables a simple, rule-based pretokenization strategy that respects script boundaries, offering a robust alternative to pretokenization strategies based on regular expressions. We also introduce and validate a constrained BPE merging strategy that enforces character integrity, applicable to both SCRIPT-BPE and byte-based BPE. Our experiments demonstrate that SCRIPT-BPE achieves competitive compression while eliminating encoding-based penalties for non-Latin-script languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures.

We investigate the design space of DCTdiff and reveal the key design factors. Experiments on different frameworks (UViT, DiT), generation tasks, and various diffusion samplers demonstrate that DCTdiff outperforms pixel-based diffusion models regarding generative quality and training efficiency. Remarkably, DCTdiff can seamlessly scale up to 512$\times$512 resolution without using the latent diffusion paradigm and beats latent diffusion (using SD-VAE) with only 1/4 training cost. Finally, we illustrate several intriguing properties of DCT image modeling. For example, we provide a theoretical proof of why 'image diffusion can be seen as spectral autoregression', bridging the gap between diffusion and autoregressive models. The effectiveness of DCTdiff and the introduced properties suggest a promising direction for image modeling in the frequency space.

Simple Architectures Meet Excellence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09263v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often criticized for their limited expressiveness, issues like over-smoothing and over-squashing, and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies. Conversely, Graph Transformers (GTs) are regarded as superior due to their employment of global attention mechanisms, which potentially mitigate these challenges. Literature frequently suggests that GTs outperform GNNs in graph-level tasks, especially for graph classification and regression on small molecular graphs. In this study, we explore the untapped potential of GNNs through an enhanced framework, GNN+, which integrates six widely used techniques: edge feature integration, normalization, dropout, residual connections, feed-forward networks, and positional encoding, to effectively tackle graph-level tasks. We conduct a systematic re-evaluation of three classic GNNs (GCN, GIN, and GatedGCN) enhanced by the GNN+ framework across 14 well-known graph-level datasets. Our results reveal that, contrary to prevailing beliefs, these classic GNNs consistently match or surpass the performance of GTs, securing top-three rankings across all datasets and achieving first place in eight. Furthermore, they demonstrate greater efficiency, running several times faster than GTs on many datasets. This highlights the potential of simple GNN architectures, challenging the notion that complex mechanisms in GTs are essential for superior graph-level performance.

However, cryptanalysis a critical area for data security and encryption has not yet been thoroughly explored in LLM evaluations. To address this gap, we evaluate cryptanalytic potential of state of the art LLMs on encrypted texts generated using a range of cryptographic algorithms. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset comprising diverse plain texts spanning various domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics paired with their encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few shot settings, we assess multiple LLMs for decryption accuracy and semantic comprehension across different encryption schemes. Our findings reveal key insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in side-channel communication while raising concerns about their susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks. This research highlights the dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing discussion on AI safety and security.</p></details> | Preprint |

This study evaluates models for phenotyping HF patients based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, using structured and unstructured data, assessing performance and interpretability. Materials and Methods: The study analyzes all HF hospitalizations at both Amsterdam UMC hospitals (AMC and VUmc) from 2015 to 2023 (33,105 hospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training, and from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included tabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF classes were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results, and textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for testing. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box) models were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured data. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge letters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF classification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from black-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models. Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone, achieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for Aug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear explanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc explanations on black-box models. Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for phenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while providing clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in transparent clinical decision-making.</p></details> | 43 pages, 8 figures |

AI capability evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior, societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually materializes when people use AI technology in context. Specifically, we describe the need for data and methods that can facilitate contextual awareness and enable downstream interpretation and decision making about AI's secondary effects, and recommend requirements for a new ecosystem.</p></details> | 9 pages |

One particularly intriguing application is transforming characters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows players to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite characters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are defined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and fixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through open-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments. Recently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs large language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into language instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical visual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only generates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an engaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state, including dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates to character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel action-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can be decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By taking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting subsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual consistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms existing methods in various aspects of the gaming experience.

Our experiments with 340M and 1.8B parameter models demonstrate that softpick achieves 0\% sink rate consistently. The softpick transformers produce hidden states with significantly lower kurtosis and creates sparse attention maps. Quantized models using softpick outperform softmax on standard benchmarks, with a particularly pronounced advantage at lower bit precisions. Our analysis and discussion shows how softpick has the potential to open new possibilities for quantization, low-precision training, sparsity optimization, pruning, and interpretability.

| **[Jacobian-free Multigrid Preconditioner for Discontinuous Galerkin Methods applied to Numerical Weather Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24504v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are promising high order discretizations for unsteady compressible flows. Here, we focus on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). These flows are characterized by a fine resolution in $z$-direction and low Mach numbers, making the system stiff. Thus, implicit time integration is required and for this a fast, highly parallel, low-memory iterative solver for the resulting algebraic systems. As a basic framework, we use inexact Jacobian-Free Newton-GMRES with a preconditioner. For low order finite volume discretizations, multigrid methods have been successfully applied to steady and unsteady fluid flows. However, for high order DG methods, such solvers are currently lacking. %The lack of efficient solvers suitable for contemporary computer architectures inhibits wider adoption of DG methods. This motivates our research to construct a Jacobian-free precondtioner for high order DG discretizations. The preconditioner is based on a multigrid method constructed for a low order finite volume discretization defined on a subgrid of the DG mesh. We design a computationally efficient and mass conservative mapping between the grids. As smoothers, explicit Runge-Kutta pseudo time iterations are used, which can be implemented in parallel in a Jacobian-free low-memory manner. We consider DG Methods for the Euler equations and for viscous flow equations in 2D, both with gravity, in a well balanced formulation. Numerical experiments in the software framework DUNE-FEM on atmospheric flow problems show the benefit of this approach.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

There exists a wide range of deepfake generation techniques, which makes it challenging to develop an accurate universal detection mechanism. The 2025 IEEE Signal Processing Cup (\textit{DFWild-Cup} competition) provided a diverse dataset of deepfake images containing significant class imbalance. The images in the dataset are generated from multiple deepfake image generators, for training machine learning model(s) to emphasize the generalization of deepfake detection. To this end, we proposed a disjoint set-based multistage training method to address the class imbalance and devised an ensemble-based architecture \emph{CAE-Net}. Our architecture consists of a convolution- and attention-based ensemble network, and employs three different neural network architectures: EfficientNet, Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and ConvNeXt with wavelet transform to capture both local and global features of deepfakes. We visualize the specific regions that these models focus on for classification using Grad-CAM, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in grouping real and fake images into cohesive clusters using t-SNE plots. Individually, the EfficientNet B0 architecture has achieved 90.79\% accuracy, whereas the ConvNeXt and the DeiT architecture have achieved 89.49\% and 89.32\% accuracy, respectively. With these networks, our weighted ensemble model achieves an excellent accuracy of 94.63\% on the validation dataset of the SP Cup 2025 competition. The equal error rate of 4.72\% and the Area Under the ROC curve of 97.37\% further confirm the stability of our proposed method. Finally, the robustness of our proposed model against adversarial perturbation attacks is tested as well, showing the inherent defensive properties of the ensemble approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in Elsevier Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation</p></details> |

Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL) models, in particular those based on Transformers, are especially relevant for visual computing tasks in general, and target detection in particular. Thus, the present work proposes an application of Deformable-DETR model, a specific architecture using deformable attention mechanisms, on remote sensing images in two different modes, especially optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To achieve this objective, two datasets are used, one optical, which is Pleiades Aircraft dataset, and the other SAR, in particular SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD). The results of a 10-fold stratified validation showed that the proposed model performed particularly well, obtaining an F1 score of 95.12% for the optical dataset and 94.54% for SSDD, while comparing these results with several models detections, especially those based on CNNs and transformers, as well as those specifically designed to detect different object classes in remote sensing images.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, paper accepted at the 29th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems (KES 2025), Osaka, Japan</p></details> |

While many recent works aim to improve this framework by designing more powerful encoders and decoders, employing advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction, Transformers or state space models (SSMs) such as Mamba for global context modeling, or hybrid combinations of both, these methods often struggle to fully utilize pretrained vision backbones (e.g., ResNet, ViT, VMamba) due to structural mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce ACM-UNet, a general-purpose segmentation framework that retains a simple UNet-like design while effectively incorporating pretrained CNNs and Mamba models through a lightweight adapter mechanism. This adapter resolves architectural incompatibilities and enables the model to harness the complementary strengths of CNNs and SSMs-namely, fine-grained local detail extraction and long-range dependency modeling. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale wavelet transform module in the decoder to enhance feature fusion and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and ACDC benchmarks demonstrate that ACM-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. Notably, it reaches 85.12% Dice Score and 13.89mm HD95 on the Synapse dataset with 17.93G FLOPs, showcasing its effectiveness and scalability.

To address this challenge, we establish two criteria that high-quality superpoints for Transformers should satisfy and introduce a corresponding two-stage superpoint generation process. The superpoints generated by our method not only have accurate boundaries, but also exhibit consistent geometric sizes and shapes, both of which greatly benefit the feature learning of superpoint Transformers. To compensate for the limitations of deep learning features when the training set size is limited, we incorporate multidimensional handcrafted features into the model. Additionally, we design a decoder that combines a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with a Transformer module to improve instance prediction and mask extraction. Finally, our network's predictions are refined using traditional algorithm-based postprocessing. For evaluation, we annotated a real-world dataset and corrected annotation errors in the existing RoofN3D dataset. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, as well as both the original and reannotated RoofN3D datasets. Moreover, our model is not sensitive to plane boundary annotations during training, significantly reducing the annotation burden. Through comprehensive experiments, we also identified key factors influencing roof plane segmentation performance: in addition to roof types, variations in point cloud density, density uniformity, and 3D point precision have a considerable impact. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating data augmentation strategies that account for point cloud quality to enhance model robustness under diverse and challenging conditions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

The cornerstone is a unified Structured LATent (SLAT) representation which allows decoding to different output formats, such as Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes. This is achieved by integrating a sparsely-populated 3D grid with dense multiview visual features extracted from a powerful vision foundation model, comprehensively capturing both structural (geometry) and textural (appearance) information while maintaining flexibility during decoding. We employ rectified flow transformers tailored for SLAT as our 3D generation models and train models with up to 2 billion parameters on a large 3D asset dataset of 500K diverse objects. Our model generates high-quality results with text or image conditions, significantly surpassing existing methods, including recent ones at similar scales.

We present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit, introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success, identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker. This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing them.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will appear in ICML 2025</p></details> |

To compute attention for increasingly long sequences, specialized accelerators have been proposed to execute key attention steps directly in hardware. Among the various recently proposed architectures, those based on variants of the FlashAttention algorithm, originally designed for GPUs, stand out due to their optimized computation, tiling capabilities, and reduced memory traffic. In this work, we focus on optimizing the kernel of floating-point-based FlashAttention using new hardware operators that fuse the computation of exponentials and vector multiplications, e.g., e^x, V. The proposed ExpMul hardware operators significantly reduce the area and power costs of FlashAttention-based hardware accelerators. When implemented in a 28nm ASIC technology, they achieve improvements of 28.8% in area and 17.6% in power, on average, compared to state-of-the-art hardware architectures with separate exponentials and vector multiplications hardware operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing SVS models overly depend on phoneme and note boundary annotations, limiting their robustness in zero-shot scenarios and producing poor transitions between phonemes and notes. Moreover, they also lack effective multi-level style control via diverse prompts. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TCSinger 2, a multi-task multilingual zero-shot SVS model with style transfer and style control based on various prompts. TCSinger 2 mainly includes three key modules: 1) Blurred Boundary Content (BBC) Encoder, predicts duration, extends content embedding, and applies masking to the boundaries to enable smooth transitions. 2) Custom Audio Encoder, uses contrastive learning to extract aligned representations from singing, speech, and textual prompts. 3) Flow-based Custom Transformer, leverages Cus-MOE, with F0 supervision, enhancing both the synthesis quality and style modeling of the generated singing voice. Experimental results show that TCSinger 2 outperforms baseline models in both subjective and objective metrics across multiple related tasks.

Although current state-of-the-art audio codecs excel in audio compression, their effectiveness significantly declines when embedding space is sharply reduced, which corresponds to higher compression. To address this problem, we propose Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ), which significantly expands the available embedding space and improves the performance while hardly sacrificing the bandwidth. Furthermore, we introduce a strategy to ensure that the vast embedding space can be fully utilized. Additionally, we propose a STFT-based discriminator to guide the generator in producing indistinguishable spectrograms.

However, their capabilities in affective analysis (i.e. sentiment analysis and emotion detection) remain underexplored. This gap is largely due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, and the inherent complexity of affective analysis tasks. In this paper, we introduce MMAFFBen, the first extensive open-source benchmark for multilingual multimodal affective analysis. MMAFFBen encompasses text, image, and video modalities across 35 languages, covering four key affective analysis tasks: sentiment polarity, sentiment intensity, emotion classification, and emotion intensity. Moreover, we construct the MMAFFIn dataset for fine-tuning LMs on affective analysis tasks, and further develop MMAFFLM-3b and MMAFFLM-7b based on it. We evaluate various representative LMs, including GPT-4o-mini, providing a systematic comparison of their affective understanding capabilities.

While deep learning has transformed image analysis, 3D medical imaging still suffers from data scarcity and inconsistencies due to acquisition protocols, scanner differences, and patient motion. Traditional augmentation uses a single pipeline for all transformations, disregarding the unique traits of each augmentation and struggling with large data volumes. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-encoder Augmentation-Aware Learning (MEAL) framework that leverages four distinct augmentation variants processed through dedicated encoders. Three fusion strategies such as concatenation (CC), fusion layer (FL), and adaptive controller block (BD) are integrated to build multi-encoder models that combine augmentation-specific features before decoding. MEAL-BD uniquely preserves augmentation-aware representations, enabling robust, protocol-invariant feature learning. As demonstrated in a Computed Tomography (CT)-to-T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) translation study, MEAL-BD consistently achieved the best performance on both unseen- and predefined-test data. On both geometric transformations (like rotations and flips) and non-augmented inputs, MEAL-BD outperformed other competing methods, achieving higher mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) scores. These results establish MEAL as a reliable framework for preserving structural fidelity and generalizing across clinically relevant variability. By reframing augmentation as a source of diverse, generalizable features, MEAL supports robust, protocol-invariant learning, advancing clinically reliable medical imaging solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

If a malicious person presents a face photo of the registered user, they may bypass the authentication process illegally. Such spoofing attacks need to be detected before face recognition. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack detection method based on Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect minute differences between live and spoofed face images. The proposed method utilizes the intermediate features of ViT, which have a good balance between local and global features that are important for spoofing attack detection, for calculating loss in training and score in inference. The proposed method also introduces two data augmentation methods: face anti-spoofing data augmentation and patch-wise data augmentation, to improve the accuracy of spoofing attack detection.

This framework heavily relies on prior domain knowledge to define interaction scope and entails high computational costs from enumeration. Conventional CTR models face a trade-off between improving representation through complex high-order feature interactions and reducing computational inefficiencies associated with these processes. To address this dual challenge, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Represented Sparse Efficient Interaction Network (KarSein). Drawing inspiration from the learnable activation mechanism in the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), KarSein leverages this mechanism to adaptively transform low-order basic features into high-order feature interactions, offering a novel approach to feature interaction modeling. KarSein extends the capabilities of KAN by introducing a more efficient architecture that significantly reduces computational costs while accommodating two-dimensional embedding vectors as feature inputs. Furthermore, it overcomes the limitation of KAN's its inability to spontaneously capture multiplicative relationships among features. Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of KarSein, demonstrating its ability to surpass not only the vanilla implementation of KAN in CTR predictio but also other baseline methods. Remarkably, KarSein achieves exceptional predictive accuracy while maintaining a highly compact parameter size and minimal computational overhead. As the first attempt to apply KAN in the CTR domain, this work introduces KarSein as a novel solution for modeling complex feature interactions, underscoring its transformative potential in advancing CTR prediction task.</p></details> | draft paper |

In this paper, we first revisit the key impact of task numbers on current MTRL method, and further reveal that naively expanding the parameters proves insufficient to counteract the performance degradation as the number of tasks escalates. Building upon these insights, we propose M3DT, a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework that tackles task scalability by further unlocking the model's parameter scalability. Specifically, we enhance both the architecture and the optimization of the agent, where we strengthen the Decision Transformer (DT) backbone with MoE to reduce task load on parameter subsets, and introduce a three-stage training mechanism to facilitate efficient training with optimal performance. Experimental results show that, by increasing the number of experts, M3DT not only consistently enhances its performance as model expansion on the fixed task numbers, but also exhibits remarkable task scalability, successfully extending to 160 tasks with superior performance.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

So far, steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings, while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied. Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity, and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 21 figures, preprint</p></details> |

Yet, achieving scalable, low-power end-to-end on-chip learning, especially from real-world sequential data with a limited number of examples, is an open challenge. Indeed, accelerators supporting error backpropagation optimize for learning performance at the expense of inference efficiency, while simplified learning algorithms often fail to reach acceptable accuracy targets. In this work, we present Chameleon, leveraging three key contributions to solve these challenges. (i) A unified learning and inference architecture supports few-shot learning (FSL), continual learning (CL) and inference at only 0.5% area overhead to the inference logic. (ii) Long temporal dependencies are efficiently captured with temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), enabling the first demonstration of end-to-end on-chip FSL and CL on sequential data and inference on 16-kHz raw audio. (iii) A dual-mode, matrix-multiplication-free compute array allows either matching the power consumption of state-of-the-art inference-only keyword spotting (KWS) accelerators or enabling $4.3\times$ higher peak GOPS. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, Chameleon sets new accuracy records on Omniglot for end-to-end on-chip FSL (96.8%, 5-way 1-shot, 98.8%, 5-way 5-shot) and CL (82.2% final accuracy for learning 250 classes with 10 shots), while maintaining an inference accuracy of 93.3% on the 12-class Google Speech Commands dataset at an extreme-edge power budget of 3.1 $\mu$W.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02355v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is a powerful tool for accelerating large language model (LLM) inference, but the accuracy-performance trade-offs across different formats remain unclear. In this paper, we conduct the most comprehensive empirical study to date, evaluating FP8, INT8, and INT4 quantization across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Through over 500,000 evaluations, our investigation yields several key findings: (1) FP8 (W8A8-FP) is effectively lossless across all model scales, (2) well-tuned INT8 (W8A8-INT) achieves surprisingly low (1-3\%) accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only (W4A16-INT) is more competitive than expected, rivaling 8-bit quantization. Further, we investigate the optimal quantization format for different deployments by analyzing inference performance through the popular vLLM framework. Our analysis provides clear deployment recommendations: W4A16 is the most cost-efficient for synchronous setups, while W8A8 dominates in asynchronous continuous batching. For mixed workloads, the optimal choice depends on the specific use case. Our findings offer practical, data-driven guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs at scale -- ensuring the best balance between speed, efficiency, and accuracy.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |

Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have shown remarkable performance in rehearsal-free CIL without requiring exemplars from previous tasks. However, existing adapter-based methods, which incorporate lightweight learnable modules into PTMs for CIL, create new adapters for each new task, leading to both parameter redundancy and failure to leverage shared knowledge across tasks. In this work, we propose ContinuaL Low-Rank Adaptation (CL-LoRA), which introduces a novel dual-adapter architecture combining \textbf{task-shared adapters} to learn cross-task knowledge and \textbf{task-specific adapters} to capture unique features of each new task. Specifically, the shared adapters utilize random orthogonal matrices and leverage knowledge distillation with gradient reassignment to preserve essential shared knowledge. In addition, we introduce learnable block-wise weights for task-specific adapters, which mitigate inter-task interference while maintaining the model's plasticity. We demonstrate CL-LoRA consistently achieves promising performance under multiple benchmarks with reduced training and inference computation, establishing a more efficient and scalable paradigm for continual learning with pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference. Further, we measure latency to show that our method can attain over 45\% end-to-end % and over 92\% self-attention latency reduction on an H100 GPU at negligible overhead cost.

Motivated by this, we propose an accurate and fast algorithm named AFIRE to address such problem in the case of mildly full scan. We discover that the derivative operator (gradient) of the involved nonlinear mapping at some special points, for example, at zero, can be represented as a composition (block multiplication) of a diagonal operator (matrix) composed of X-ray transforms (projection matrices) and a very small-scale matrix. Based on the insights, the AFIRE is proposed respectively from the continuous, discrete and actual-use perspectives by leveraging the simplified Newton method. Under proper conditions, we establish the convergence theory of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, numerical experiments are also carried out to verify that the proposed algorithm can accurately and effectively reconstruct the basis images in completely geometric-inconsistency dual-energy CT with noiseless and noisy projection data. Particularly, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, the flexibility and extensibility of the proposed algorithm are also demonstrated.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 15 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout" also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Findings; 5 pages, 2 figures, 4 pages of appendix</p></details> |
| **[AXIOM: Learning to Play Games in Minutes with Expanding Object-Centric Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24784v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 4 figures, 2 tables; 25 pages supplementary material, 8 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we propose SCoPE (Scheduled interpolation of Coarse-to-fine Prompt Embeddings), a training-free method to improve text-to-image alignment by progressively refining the input prompt in a coarse-to-fine-grained manner. Given a detailed input prompt, we first decompose it into multiple sub-prompts which evolve from describing broad scene layout to highly intricate details. During inference, we interpolate between these sub-prompts and thus progressively introduce finer-grained details into the generated image. Our training-free plug-and-play approach significantly enhances prompt alignment, achieves an average improvement of more than +8 in Visual Question Answering (VQA) scores over the Stable Diffusion baselines on 83% of the prompts from the GenAI-Bench dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshops (AI4CC (oral) & GMCV (poster))</p></details> |

However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect HelpSteer3 data to train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 figures, Accepted to ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[A studentized permutation test for the treatment effect in individual participant data meta-analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24774v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-analysis is a well-established tool used to combine data from several independent studies, each of which usually compares the effect of an experimental treatment with a control group. While meta-analyses are often performed using aggregated study summaries, they may also be conducted using individual participant data (IPD). Classical meta-analysis models may be generalized to handle continuous IPD by formulating them within a linear mixed model framework. IPD meta-analyses are commonly based on a small number of studies. Technically, inference for the overall treatment effect can be performed using Student-t approximation. However, as some approaches may not adequately control the type I error, Satterthwaite's or Kenward-Roger's method have been suggested to set the degrees-of-freedom parameter. The latter also adjusts the standard error of the treatment effect estimator. Nevertheless, these methods may be conservative. Since permutation tests are known to control the type I error and offer robustness to violations of distributional assumptions, we propose a studentized permutation test for the treatment effect based on permutations of standardized residuals across studies in IPD meta-analysis. Also, we construct confidence intervals for the treatment effect based on this test. The first interval is derived from the percentiles of the permutation distribution. The second interval is obtained by searching values closest to the effect estimate that are just significantly different from the true effect. In a simulation study, we demonstrate satisfactory performance of the proposed methods, often producing shorter confidence intervals compared with competitors.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

To address this, we introduce MAGIC-VQA, a novel framework that enhances VQA by systematically integrating commonsense knowledge with LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA employs a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Knowledge Integration from external sources, (2) By-Type Post-Processing for contextual refinement, and (3) Implicit Knowledge Augmentation using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for structured reasoning. While GNNs bring greater depth to structured inference, they enable superior relational inference beyond LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA bridges a key gap by unifying commonsensse knowledge with LVLM-driven reasoning, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or complex prompt tuning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, significantly improving commonsense reasoning in VQA.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2025 |

However, they struggle with temporal reasoning, which requires processing time-related information such as event sequencing, durations, and inter-temporal relationships. These capabilities are critical for applications including question answering, scheduling, and historical analysis. In this paper, we introduce TISER, a novel framework that enhances the temporal reasoning abilities of LLMs through a multi-stage process that combines timeline construction with iterative self-reflection. Our approach leverages test-time scaling to extend the length of reasoning traces, enabling models to capture complex temporal dependencies more effectively. This strategy not only boosts reasoning accuracy but also improves the traceability of the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including out-of-distribution test sets, and reveal that TISER enables smaller open-source models to surpass larger closed-weight models on challenging temporal reasoning tasks.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Main) |
| **[Efficient Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis for expensive and non-differentiable physics-based simulations in high stochastic dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24708v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional Bayesian inverse analysis (dim >> 100) is mostly unfeasible for computationally demanding, nonlinear physics-based high-fidelity (HF) models. Usually, the use of more efficient gradient-based inference schemes is impeded if the multi-physics models are provided by complex legacy codes. Adjoint-based derivatives are either exceedingly cumbersome to derive or non-existent for practically relevant large-scale nonlinear and coupled multi-physics problems. Similarly, holistic automated differentiation w.r.t. primary variables of multi-physics codes is usually not yet an option and requires extensive code restructuring if not considered from the outset in the software design. This absence of differentiability further exacerbates the already present computational challenges. To overcome the existing limitations, we propose a novel inference approach called Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA), which leverages simpler and computationally cheaper lower-fidelity (LF) models that are designed to provide model derivatives. BMFIA learns a simple, probabilistic dependence of the LF and HF models, which is then employed in an altered likelihood formulation to statistically correct the inaccurate LF response. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this dependence represents a multi-fidelity conditional density (discriminative model). We demonstrate how this multi-fidelity conditional density can be learned robustly in the small data regime from only a few HF and LF simulations (50 to 300), which would not be sufficient for naive surrogate approaches. The formulation is fully differentiable and allows the flexible design of a wide range of LF models. We demonstrate that BMFIA solves Bayesian inverse problems for scenarios that used to be prohibitive, such as finely-resolved spatial reconstruction problems for nonlinear and transient coupled poro-elastic media physics.</p></details> | 42 pages, 20 figures |

This paper presents an approach for generating synthetic ABSA data using Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this gap. We detail the generation process aimed at producing data with consistent topic and sentiment distributions across multiple domains using GPT-4o. The quality and utility of the generated data were evaluated by assessing the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) on topic and sentiment classification tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthetic data, revealing distinct performance trade-offs among the models: DeepSeekR1 showed higher precision, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited strong recall, and Gemini 1.5 Pro offered significantly faster inference. We conclude that LLM-based synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible method for creating valuable ABSA resources, facilitating research and model evaluation without reliance on limited or inaccessible real-world labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, 6th International Conference on Natural Language Computing and AI (NLCAI 2025), ISBN : 978-1-923107-59-5, Computer Science & Information Technology (CS & IT), ISSN : 2231 - 5403, Volume 15, Number 10, May 2025</p></details> |

Real video games are crafted to be intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases, making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time. VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in these research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 33 pages including supplementary</p></details> |

Drawing inspiration from Searle's Chinese Room, we propose the \textbf{Visual Room} argument: a system may process and describe every detail of visual inputs by following algorithmic rules, without genuinely comprehending the underlying intention. This dilemma challenges the prevailing assumption that perceptual mastery implies genuine understanding. In implementation, we introduce a two-tier evaluation framework spanning perception and cognition. The perception component evaluates whether MLMs can accurately capture the surface-level details of visual contents, where the cognitive component examines their ability to infer sarcasm polarity. To support this framework, We further introduce a high-quality multi-modal sarcasm dataset comprising both 924 static images and 100 dynamic videos. All sarcasm labels are annotated by the original authors and verified by independent reviewers to ensure clarity and consistency. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art (SoTA) MLMs. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) MLMs demonstrate high accuracy in visual perception; (2) even with correct perception, MLMs exhibit an average error rate of ~17.1\% in sarcasm understanding, revealing a significant gap between seeing and understanding; (3) this gap stems from weaknesses in context integration, emotional reasoning, and pragmatic inference. This work provides empirical grounding for the proposed Visual Room argument and offers a new evaluation paradigm for MLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Ontological Component-based Description of Robot Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07569v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key aspect of a robot's knowledge base is self-awareness about what it is capable of doing. It allows to define which tasks it can be assigned to and which it cannot. We will refer to this knowledge as the Capability concept. As capabilities stems from the components the robot owns, they can be linked together. In this work, we hypothesize that this concept can be inferred from the components rather than merely linked to them. Therefore, we introduce an ontological means of inferring the agent's capabilities based on the components it owns as well as low-level capabilities. This inference allows the agent to acknowledge what it is able to do in a responsive way and it is generalizable to external entities the agent can carry for example. To initiate an action, the robot needs to link its capabilities with external entities. To do so, it needs to infer affordance relations from its capabilities as well as the external entity's dispositions. This work is part of a broader effort to integrate social affordances into a Human-Robot collaboration context and is an extension of an already existing ontology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Workshop on Working towards Ontology-based Standards for Robotics and Automation (WOSRA 2023 - 2nd Edition), Jun 2023, Londres, United Kingdom</p></details> |
| **[Density Ratio Permutation Tests with connections to distributional shifts and conditional two-sample testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24529v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce novel hypothesis tests to allow for statistical inference for density ratios. More precisely, we introduce the Density Ratio Permutation Test (DRPT) for testing $H_0: g \propto r f$ based on independent data drawn from distributions with densities $f$ and $g$, where the hypothesised density ratio $r$ is a fixed function. The proposed test employs an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to draw permutations of the combined dataset according to a distribution determined by $r$, producing exchangeable versions of the whole sample and thereby establishing finite-sample validity. Regarding the test's behaviour under the alternative hypothesis, we begin by demonstrating that if the test statistic is chosen as an Integral Probability Metric (IPM), the DRPT is consistent under mild assumptions on the function class that defines the IPM. We then narrow our focus to the setting where the function class is a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, and introduce a generalisation of the classical Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which we term Shifted-MMD. For continuous data, assuming that a normalised version of $g - rf$ lies in a Sobolev ball, we establish the minimax optimality of the DRPT based on the Shifted-MMD. We further extend our approach to scenarios with an unknown shift factor $r$, estimating it from part of the data using Density Ratio Estimation techniques, and derive Type-I error bounds based on estimation error. Additionally, we demonstrate how the DRPT can be adapted for conditional two-sample testing, establishing it as a versatile tool for assessing modelling assumptions on importance weights, covariate shifts and related scenarios, which frequently arise in contexts such as transfer learning and causal inference. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 67 pages, 11 figures |

The key distinction lies in how visual tokens are processed. Decoder-only architectures apply self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens, while cross-attention architectures skip these computations. To investigate whether redundancy exists in this computationally expensive process, we propose a training-free framework for analyzing trained MLLMs. It consists of Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN and Hollow Attention, which enable adjustable reductions in computations for visual tokens, as well as a Layer Ranking Algorithm that prioritizes layers for these reductions. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial, structured, and clustered redundancy unique to decoder-only MLLMs, offering valuable insights for future MLLM architecture design. Furthermore, by leveraging our reduction framework as a training-free inference acceleration approach, we achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods while remaining compatible with them.

Here, we focus on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). These flows are characterized by a fine resolution in $z$-direction and low Mach numbers, making the system stiff. Thus, implicit time integration is required and for this a fast, highly parallel, low-memory iterative solver for the resulting algebraic systems. As a basic framework, we use inexact Jacobian-Free Newton-GMRES with a preconditioner. For low order finite volume discretizations, multigrid methods have been successfully applied to steady and unsteady fluid flows. However, for high order DG methods, such solvers are currently lacking. %The lack of efficient solvers suitable for contemporary computer architectures inhibits wider adoption of DG methods. This motivates our research to construct a Jacobian-free precondtioner for high order DG discretizations. The preconditioner is based on a multigrid method constructed for a low order finite volume discretization defined on a subgrid of the DG mesh. We design a computationally efficient and mass conservative mapping between the grids. As smoothers, explicit Runge-Kutta pseudo time iterations are used, which can be implemented in parallel in a Jacobian-free low-memory manner. We consider DG Methods for the Euler equations and for viscous flow equations in 2D, both with gravity, in a well balanced formulation. Numerical experiments in the software framework DUNE-FEM on atmospheric flow problems show the benefit of this approach.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |

The approach applies masks to input and output tensors using key-conditioned graph dynamics, enabling authenticated inference, user attribution, and soft output watermarking without modifying model architectures. While the underlying chaotic system used to generate each mask is not analytically invertible, the masking operation itself is algebraically reversible by authorized key holders, offering functional privacy without formal cryptographic guarantees. Unlike traditional encryption or secure multi-party computation, this method operates in continuous space and imposes minimal computational overhead. We describe the construction of the masking system, including graph sampling, dynamical rule selection, and chaos diagnostics. Applications include privacy-preserving inference, secure data contribution, and per-user watermarking in shared model pipelines. This framework offers a practical and modular building block for user-controlled privacy in modern AI systems.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Inspired by ResNet's residual learning, we propose Residual Mixture-of-Agents (RMoA), integrating residual connections to optimize efficiency and reliability. To maximize information utilization from model responses while minimizing computational costs, we innovatively design an embedding-based diversity selection mechanism that greedily selects responses via vector similarity. Furthermore, to mitigate iterative information degradation, we introduce a Residual Extraction Agent to preserve cross-layer incremental information by capturing inter-layer response differences, coupled with a Residual Aggregation Agent for hierarchical information integration. Additionally, we propose an adaptive termination mechanism that dynamically halts processing based on residual convergence, further improving inference efficiency. RMoA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmarks of across alignment, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and multitasking understanding, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Our previous work undertook the first substantial spatial modelling investigation of temperature record-breaking across years for any given day within the year, employing a dataset consisting of over sixty years of daily maximum temperatures across peninsular Spain. That dataset also supplies daily minimum temperatures (which, in fact, are now available through 2023). Here, the dataset is converted into a daily pair of binary events, indicators, for that day, of whether a yearly record was broken for the daily maximum temperature and/or for the daily minimum temperature. Joint modelling addresses several inference issues: (i) defining/modelling record-breaking with bivariate time series of yearly indicators, (ii) strength of relationship between record-breaking events, (iii) prediction of joint, conditional and marginal record-breaking, (iv) persistence in record-breaking across days, (v) spatial interpolation across peninsular Spain. We substantially expand our previous work to enable investigation of these issues. We observe strong correlation between both processes but a growing trend of climate change that is well differentiated between them both spatially and temporally as well as different strengths of persistence and spatial dependence.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (+25 pages supplement), 13 figures (+14 figures supplement), 3 tables (+4 tables supplement)</p></details> |
| **[Three Kinds of Negation in Knowledge and Their Mathematical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24422v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of artificial intelligence, understanding, distinguishing, expressing, and computing the negation in knowledge is a fundamental issue in knowledge processing and research. In this paper, we examine and analyze the understanding and characteristics of negation in various fields such as philosophy, logic, and linguistics etc. Based on the distinction between the concepts of contradiction and opposition, we propose that there are three different types of negation in knowledge from a conceptual perspective: contradictory negation, opposite negation, and intermediary negation. To establish a mathematical foundation that fully reflects the intrinsic connections, properties, and laws of these different forms of negation, we introduce SCOI: sets with contradictory negation, opposite negation and intermediary negation, and LCOI: logic with contradictory negation, opposite negation and intermediary negation, and we proved the main operational properties of SCOI as well as the formal inference relations in LCOI.</p></details> | 32 pages,13 figures |
| **[Leveraging Intermediate Features of Vision Transformer for Face Anti-Spoofing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24402v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against changes in head pose, illumination, and blurring during image capture. If a malicious person presents a face photo of the registered user, they may bypass the authentication process illegally. Such spoofing attacks need to be detected before face recognition. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack detection method based on Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect minute differences between live and spoofed face images. The proposed method utilizes the intermediate features of ViT, which have a good balance between local and global features that are important for spoofing attack detection, for calculating loss in training and score in inference. The proposed method also introduces two data augmentation methods: face anti-spoofing data augmentation and patch-wise data augmentation, to improve the accuracy of spoofing attack detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using the OULU-NPU and SiW datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Inference for Spatially-Temporally Misaligned Data Using Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24397v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air pollution remains a major environmental risk factor that is often associated with adverse health outcomes. However, quantifying and evaluating its effects on human health is challenging due to the complex nature of exposure data. Recent technological advances have led to the collection of various indicators of air pollution at increasingly high spatial-temporal resolutions (e.g., daily averages of pollutant levels at spatial locations referenced by latitude-longitude). However, health outcomes are typically aggregated over several spatial-temporal coordinates (e.g., annual prevalence for a county) to comply with survey regulations. This article develops a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze such spatially-temporally misaligned exposure and health outcome data. We introduce Bayesian predictive stacking, which optimally combines multiple predictive spatial-temporal models and avoids iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo that struggle due to convergence issues inflicted by the presence of weakly identified parameters. We apply our proposed method to study the effects of ozone on asthma in the state of California.</p></details> | 34 pages, 14 figures |

| **[Interpreting Large Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Dictionary Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24360v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders are a promising new approach for decomposing language model activations for interpretation and control. They have been applied successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable interpretability to SAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Mechanistic Interpretability for Vision at CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[TROVE: A Challenge for Fine-Grained Text Provenance via Source Sentence Tracing and Relationship Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15289v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have achieved remarkable fluency and coherence in text generation, yet their widespread adoption has raised concerns about content reliability and accountability. In high-stakes domains, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT-4o provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation. We make our dataset available here: https://github.com/ZNLP/ZNLP-Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

This combination does not, in general, produce a doubly robust estimator, even after regression standardization, when there is truly a causal effect. We demonstrate via simulation this lack of double robustness for the semiparametric Cox model, the Weibull proportional hazards model, and a simple proportional hazards flexible parametric model, with both the latter models fit via maximum likelihood. We provide a novel proof that the combination of propensity score weighting and a proportional hazards survival model, fit either via full or partial likelihood, is consistent under the null of no causal effect of the exposure on the outcome under particular censoring mechanisms if either the propensity score or the outcome model is correctly specified and contains all confounders. Given our results suggesting that double robustness only exists under the null, we outline two simple alternative estimators that are doubly robust for the survival difference at a given time point (in the above sense), provided the censoring mechanism can be correctly modeled, and one doubly robust method of estimation for the full survival curve. We provide R code to use these estimators for estimation and inference in the supporting information.</p></details> | <details><summary>corre...</summary><p>correction to equation 8</p></details> |
| **[KairosAD: A SAM-Based Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection on Embedded Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24334v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of intelligent manufacturing, anomaly detection has become essential for maintaining quality control on modern production lines. However, while many existing models show promising performance, they are often too large, computationally demanding, and impractical to deploy on resource-constrained embedded devices that can be easily installed on the production lines of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). To bridge this gap, we present KairosAD, a novel supervised approach that uses the power of the Mobile Segment Anything Model (MobileSAM) for image-based anomaly detection. KairosAD has been evaluated on the two well-known industrial anomaly detection datasets, i.e., MVTec-AD and ViSA. The results show that KairosAD requires 78% fewer parameters and boasts a 4x faster inference time compared to the leading state-of-the-art model, while maintaining comparable AUROC performance. We deployed KairosAD on two embedded devices, the NVIDIA Jetson NX, and the NVIDIA Jetson AGX. Finally, KairosAD was successfully installed and tested on the real production line of the Industrial Computer Engineering Laboratory (ICE Lab) at the University of Verona. The code is available at https://github.com/intelligolabs/KairosAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 23rd International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[CogniBench: A Legal-inspired Framework and Dataset for Assessing Cognitive Faithfulness of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20767v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Faithfulness hallucinations are claims generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) not supported by contexts provided to the LLM. Lacking assessment standards, existing benchmarks focus on "factual statements" that rephrase source materials while overlooking "cognitive statements" that involve making inferences from the given context. Consequently, evaluating and detecting the hallucination of cognitive statements remains challenging. Inspired by how evidence is assessed in the legal domain, we design a rigorous framework to assess different levels of faithfulness of cognitive statements and introduce the CogniBench dataset where we reveal insightful statistics. To keep pace with rapidly evolving LLMs, we further develop an automatic annotation pipeline that scales easily across different models. This results in a large-scale CogniBench-L dataset, which facilitates training accurate detectors for both factual and cognitive hallucinations. We release our model and datasets at: https://github.com/FUTUREEEEEE/CogniBench</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[GLTW: Joint Improved Graph Transformer and LLM via Three-Word Language for Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11471v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), which aims to infer missing or incomplete facts, is a crucial task for KGs. However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025(Findings)</p></details> |
| **[InteractAnything: Zero-shot Human Object Interaction Synthesis via LLM Feedback and Object Affordance Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24315v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D human-aware generation have made significant progress. However, existing methods still struggle with generating novel Human Object Interaction (HOI) from text, particularly for open-set objects. We identify three main challenges of this task: precise human-object relation reasoning, affordance parsing for any object, and detailed human interaction pose synthesis aligning description and object geometry. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot 3D HOI generation framework without training on specific datasets, leveraging the knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models. Specifically, the human-object relations are inferred from large language models (LLMs) to initialize object properties and guide the optimization process. Then we utilize a pre-trained 2D image diffusion model to parse unseen objects and extract contact points, avoiding the limitations imposed by existing 3D asset knowledge. The initial human pose is generated by sampling multiple hypotheses through multi-view SDS based on the input text and object geometry. Finally, we introduce a detailed optimization to generate fine-grained, precise, and natural interaction, enforcing realistic 3D contact between the 3D object and the involved body parts, including hands in grasping. This is achieved by distilling human-level feedback from LLMs to capture detailed human-object relations from the text instruction. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to prior works, particularly in terms of the fine-grained nature of interactions and the ability to handle open-set 3D objects.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

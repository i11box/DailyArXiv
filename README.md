| **[Cat, Rat, Meow: On the Alignment of Language Model and Human Term-Similarity Judgments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07965v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small and mid-sized generative language models have gained increasing attention. Their size and availability make them amenable to being analyzed at a behavioral as well as a representational level, allowing investigations of how these levels interact. We evaluate 32 publicly available language models for their representational and behavioral alignment with human similarity judgments on a word triplet task. This provides a novel evaluation setting to probe semantic associations in language beyond common pairwise comparisons. We find that (1) even the representations of small language models can achieve human-level alignment, (2) instruction-tuned model variants can exhibit substantially increased agreement, (3) the pattern of alignment across layers is highly model dependent, and (4) alignment based on models' behavioral responses is highly dependent on model size, matching their representational alignment only for the largest evaluated models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop on Representational Alignment (Re-Align)</p></details> |
| **[PixelFlow: Pixel-Space Generative Models with Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07963v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present PixelFlow, a family of image generation models that operate directly in the raw pixel space, in contrast to the predominant latent-space models. This approach simplifies the image generation process by eliminating the need for a pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and enabling the whole model end-to-end trainable. Through efficient cascade flow modeling, PixelFlow achieves affordable computation cost in pixel space. It achieves an FID of 1.98 on 256$\times$256 ImageNet class-conditional image generation benchmark. The qualitative text-to-image results demonstrate that PixelFlow excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope this new paradigm will inspire and open up new opportunities for next-generation visual generation models.

| **[Geo4D: Leveraging Video Generators for Geometric 4D Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07961v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Geo4D, a method to repurpose video diffusion models for monocular 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. By leveraging the strong dynamic prior captured by such video models, Geo4D can be trained using only synthetic data while generalizing well to real data in a zero-shot manner. Geo4D predicts several complementary geometric modalities, namely point, depth, and ray maps. It uses a new multi-modal alignment algorithm to align and fuse these modalities, as well as multiple sliding windows, at inference time, thus obtaining robust and accurate 4D reconstruction of long videos. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Geo4D significantly surpasses state-of-the-art video depth estimation methods, including recent methods such as MonST3R, which are also designed to handle dynamic scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, Project page: https://geo4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[GLUS: Global-Local Reasoning Unified into A Single Large Language Model for Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07962v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel framework utilizing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for referring video object segmentation (RefVOS). Previous MLLM-based methods commonly struggle with the dilemma between "Ref" and "VOS": they either specialize in understanding a few key frames (global reasoning) or tracking objects on continuous frames (local reasoning), and rely on external VOS or frame selectors to mitigate the other end of the challenge. However, our framework GLUS shows that global and local consistency can be unified into a single video segmentation MLLM: a set of sparse "context frames" provides global information, while a stream of continuous "query frames" conducts local object tracking. This is further supported by jointly training the MLLM with a pre-trained VOS memory bank to simultaneously digest short-range and long-range temporal information. To improve the information efficiency within the limited context window of MLLMs, we introduce object contrastive learning to distinguish hard false-positive objects and a self-refined framework to identify crucial frames and perform propagation. By collectively integrating these insights, our GLUS delivers a simple yet effective baseline, achieving new state-of-the-art for MLLMs on the MeViS and Ref-Youtube-VOS benchmark.

| **[Interactive4D: Interactive 4D LiDAR Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08206v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive segmentation has an important role in facilitating the annotation process of future LiDAR datasets. Existing approaches sequentially segment individual objects at each LiDAR scan, repeating the process throughout the entire sequence, which is redundant and ineffective. In this work, we propose interactive 4D segmentation, a new paradigm that allows segmenting multiple objects on multiple LiDAR scans simultaneously, and Interactive4D, the first interactive 4D segmentation model that segments multiple objects on superimposed consecutive LiDAR scans in a single iteration by utilizing the sequential nature of LiDAR data. While performing interactive segmentation, our model leverages the entire space-time volume, leading to more efficient segmentation. Operating on the 4D volume, it directly provides consistent instance IDs over time and also simplifies tracking annotations. Moreover, we show that click simulations are crucial for successful model training on LiDAR point clouds. To this end, we design a click simulation strategy that is better suited for the characteristics of LiDAR data. To demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness, we evaluate Interactive4D on multiple LiDAR datasets, where Interactive4D achieves a new state-of-the-art by a large margin. We publicly release the code and models at https://vision.rwth-aachen.de/Interactive4D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA2025!</p></details> |
| **[VisualCloze: A Universal Image Generation Framework via Visual In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07960v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in diffusion models significantly advances various image generation tasks. However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://visualcloze.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Perception-R1: Pioneering Perception Policy with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07954v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1, we explore the potential of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) in MLLM post-training for perception policy learning. While promising, our initial experiments reveal that incorporating a thinking process through RL does not consistently lead to performance gains across all visual perception tasks. This leads us to delve into the essential role of RL in the context of visual perception. In this work, we return to the fundamentals and explore the effects of RL on different perception tasks. We observe that the perceptual complexity is a major factor in determining the effectiveness of RL. We also observe that reward design plays a crucial role in further approching the upper limit of model perception. To leverage these findings, we propose Perception-R1, a scalable RL framework using GRPO during MLLM post-training. With a standard Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Perception-R1 achieves +4.2% on RefCOCO+, +17.9% on PixMo-Count, +4.2% on PageOCR, and notably, 31.9% AP on COCO2017 val for the first time, establishing a strong baseline for perception policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github page: https://github.com/linkangheng/PR1</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Cheatsheet: Test-Time Learning with Adaptive Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07952v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive performance on complex tasks, current language models (LMs) typically operate in a vacuum: Each input query is processed separately, without retaining insights from previous attempts. Here, we present Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM with a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or re-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and reuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving insights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance substantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth labels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than doubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across questions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to 99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks prone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o and Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated code, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic challenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks. Claude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro problems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise, transferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or static retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly, without modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, our findings present DC as a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the divide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven learning characteristic of human cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/suzgunmirac/dynamic-cheatsheet</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Laws for Native Multimodal Models Scaling Laws for Native Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07951v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building general-purpose models that can effectively perceive the world through multimodal signals has been a long-standing goal. Current approaches involve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting vision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such approaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question whether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)--those trained from the ground up on all modalities--and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy. Motivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show that incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows for models that learn modality-specific weights, significantly enhancing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 26 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Taming Data and Transformers for Scalable Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19388v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of ambient sound generators is hindered by data scarcity, insufficient caption quality, and limited scalability in model architecture. This work addresses these challenges by advancing both data and model scaling. First, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset collection pipeline tailored for ambient audio generation, resulting in AutoReCap-XL, the largest ambient audio-text dataset with over 47 million clips. To provide high-quality textual annotations, we propose AutoCap, a high-quality automatic audio captioning model. By adopting a Q-Former module and leveraging audio metadata, AutoCap substantially enhances caption quality, reaching a CIDEr score of $83.2$, a $3.2\%$ improvement over previous captioning models. Finally, we propose GenAu, a scalable transformer-based audio generation architecture that we scale up to 1.25B parameters. We demonstrate its benefits from data scaling with synthetic captions as well as model size scaling. When compared to baseline audio generators trained at similar size and data scale, GenAu obtains significant improvements of $4.7\%$ in FAD score, $11.1\%$ in IS, and $13.5\%$ in CLAP score. Our code, model checkpoints, and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://snap-research.github.io/GenAU/</p></details> |
| **[Characteristic function-based tests for spatial randomness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07946v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new type of test for complete spatial randomness that applies to mapped point patterns in a rectangle or a cube of any dimension. This is the first test of its kind to be based on characteristic functions and utilizes a weighted L2-distance between the empirical and uniform characteristic functions. It is simple to calculate and does not require adjusting for edge effects. An efficient algorithm is developed to find the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic under the Cauchy weight function. In a simulation, our test shows varying sensitivity to different levels of spatial interaction depending on the scale parameter of the Cauchy weight function. Tests with different parameter values can be combined to create a Bonferroni-corrected omnibus test, which is almost always more powerful than the popular L-test and the Clark-Evans test for detecting heterogeneous and aggregated alternatives, although less powerful than the L-test for detecting regular alternatives. The simplicity of empirical characteristic function makes it straightforward to extend our test to non-rectangular or sparsely sampled point patterns.</p></details> | 24 pages, 4 figures |

| **[From Winter Storm Thermodynamics to Wind Gust Extremes: Discovering Interpretable Equations from Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07905v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliably identifying and understanding temporal precursors to extreme wind gusts is crucial for early warning and mitigation. This study proposes a simple data-driven approach to extract key predictors from a dataset of historical extreme European winter windstorms and derive simple equations linking these precursors to extreme gusts over land. A major challenge is the limited training data for extreme events, increasing the risk of model overfitting. Testing various mitigation strategies, we find that combining dimensionality reduction, careful cross-validation, feature selection, and a nonlinear transformation of maximum wind gusts informed by Generalized Extreme Value distributions successfully reduces overfitting. These measures yield interpretable equations that generalize across regions while maintaining satisfactory predictive skill. The discovered equations reveal the association between a steady drying low-troposphere before landfall and wind gust intensity in Northwestern Europe.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[The Efficacy of Semantics-Preserving Transformations in Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07904v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is a central component of joint embedding self-supervised learning (SSL). Approaches that work for natural images may not always be effective in medical imaging tasks. This study systematically investigated the impact of data augmentation and preprocessing strategies in SSL for lung ultrasound. Three data augmentation pipelines were assessed: (1) a baseline pipeline commonly used across imaging domains, (2) a novel semantic-preserving pipeline designed for ultrasound, and (3) a distilled set of the most effective transformations from both pipelines. Pretrained models were evaluated on multiple classification tasks: B-line detection, pleural effusion detection, and COVID-19 classification. Experiments revealed that semantics-preserving data augmentation resulted in the greatest performance for COVID-19 classification - a diagnostic task requiring global image context. Cropping-based methods yielded the greatest performance on the B-line and pleural effusion object classification tasks, which require strong local pattern recognition. Lastly, semantics-preserving ultrasound image preprocessing resulted in increased downstream performance for multiple tasks. Guidance regarding data augmentation and preprocessing strategies was synthesized for practitioners working with SSL in ultrasound.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 12 figures, 18 tables, Submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |
| **[Robust image representations with counterfactual contrastive learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10365v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive pretraining can substantially increase model generalisation and downstream performance. However, the quality of the learned representations is highly dependent on the data augmentation strategy applied to generate positive pairs. Positive contrastive pairs should preserve semantic meaning while discarding unwanted variations related to the data acquisition domain. Traditional contrastive pipelines attempt to simulate domain shifts through pre-defined generic image transformations. However, these do not always mimic realistic and relevant domain variations for medical imaging, such as scanner differences. To tackle this issue, we herein introduce counterfactual contrastive learning, a novel framework leveraging recent advances in causal image synthesis to create contrastive positive pairs that faithfully capture relevant domain variations. Our method, evaluated across five datasets encompassing both chest radiography and mammography data, for two established contrastive objectives (SimCLR and DINO-v2), outperforms standard contrastive learning in terms of robustness to acquisition shift. Notably, counterfactual contrastive learning achieves superior downstream performance on both in-distribution and external datasets, especially for images acquired with scanners under-represented in the training set. Further experiments show that the proposed framework extends beyond acquisition shifts, with models trained with counterfactual contrastive learning reducing subgroup disparities across biological sex.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/biomedia-mira/counterfactual-contrastive/</p></details> |
| **[V2V3D: View-to-View Denoised 3D Reconstruction for Light-Field Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07853v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Light field microscopy (LFM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to capture snapshot-based, large-scale 3D fluorescence images. However, existing LFM reconstruction algorithms are highly sensitive to sensor noise or require hard-to-get ground-truth annotated data for training. To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based framework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image denoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture. We assume that the LF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view being independent. This enables V2V3D to incorporate the principle of noise2noise for effective denoising. To enhance the recovery of high-frequency details, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique, which transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in wave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature alignment. Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their corresponding 3D intensity volumes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high computational efficiency and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. These advancements position V2V3D as a promising solution for 3D imaging under challenging conditions.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Understanding Learner-LLM Chatbot Interactions and the Impact of Prompting Guidelines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07840v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language-based communication with AI-powered chatbots. These models are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to articulate requests with minimal effort. However, despite their accessibility, studies reveal that users often struggle with effective prompting, resulting in inefficient responses. Existing research has highlighted both the limitations of LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties users face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI interactions through an educational experiment in which participants receive structured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three types of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a structured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and prompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users. Using Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction analysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring behavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by examining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the overall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured prompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication. By comparing different instructional frameworks, we offer insights into more effective approaches for improving user competency in AI interactions, with implications for AI literacy, chatbot usability, and the design of more responsive AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for AIED 2025, the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, July 22 - 26, 2025, Palermo, Italy</p></details> |
| **[Smoothed Distance Kernels for MMDs and Applications in Wasserstein Gradient Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07820v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Negative distance kernels $K(x,y) := - \|x-y\|$ were used in the definition of maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) in statistics and lead to favorable numerical results in various applications. In particular, so-called slicing techniques for handling high-dimensional kernel summations profit from the simple parameter-free structure of the distance kernel. However, due to its non-smoothness in $x=y$, most of the classical theoretical results, e.g. on Wasserstein gradient flows of the corresponding MMD functional do not longer hold true. In this paper, we propose a new kernel which keeps the favorable properties of the negative distance kernel as being conditionally positive definite of order one with a nearly linear increase towards infinity and a simple slicing structure, but is Lipschitz differentiable now. Our construction is based on a simple 1D smoothing procedure of the absolute value function followed by a Riemann-Liouville fractional integral transform. Numerical results demonstrate that the new kernel performs similarly well as the negative distance kernel in gradient descent methods, but now with theoretical guarantees.</p></details> | 48 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Adaptive Detection of Fast Moving Celestial Objects Using a Mixture of Experts and Physical-Inspired Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07777v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.</p></details> | Accepted by the AJ |

To address this gap, we introduce KEDiT, an efficient method for fine-tuning LLMs for knowledge-grounded dialogue generation. KEDiT operates in two main phases: first, it employs an information bottleneck to compress retrieved knowledge into learnable parameters, retaining essential information while minimizing computational overhead. Second, a lightweight knowledge-aware adapter integrates these compressed knowledge vectors into the LLM during fine-tuning, updating less than 2\% of the model parameters. The experimental results on the Wizard of Wikipedia and a newly constructed PubMed-Dialog dataset demonstrate that KEDiT excels in generating contextually relevant and informative responses, outperforming competitive baselines in automatic, LLM-based, and human evaluations. This approach effectively combines the strengths of pretrained LLMs with the adaptability needed for incorporating dynamic knowledge, presenting a scalable solution for fields such as medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TACL; pre-MIT Press publication version.

| **[Attitude Estimation via Matrix Fisher Distributions on SO(3) Using Non-Unit Vector Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11566v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This note presents a novel Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution on the special orthogonal group, which can smoothly accommodate both unit and non-unit vector measurements. The posterior attitude distribution is proven to be a matrix Fisher distribution with the assumption that non-unit vector measurement errors follow the isotropic Gaussian distributions and unit vector measurements follow the von-Mises Fisher distributions. Next, a global unscented transformation is proposed to approximate the full likelihood distribution with a matrix Fisher distribution for more generic cases of vector measurement errors following the non-isotropic Gaussian distributions. Following these, a Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution is constructed. Numerical examples are then presented. The proposed estimator exhibits advantageous performance compared with the previous attitude estimator with matrix Fisher distributions and the classic multiplicative extended Kalman filter in the case of non-unit vector measurements.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

While these assumptions enable tractable mathematical characterizations, they fail to capture the stringent requirements of some emerging next-generation wireless applications, such as ultra-reliable low latency communication and ultra-massive machine type communication, in which it is required to support a much wider range of features including short-packet communication, extremely low latency, and/or low energy consumption. To better support such applications, it is important to consider finite-blocklength information theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the advances in this field, followed by a discussion on the open questions. Specifically, we commence with the fundamental limits of source coding in the non-asymptotic regime, with a particular focus on lossless and lossy compression in point-to-point~(P2P) and multiterminal cases. Next, we discuss the fundamental limits of channel coding in P2P channels, multiple access channels, and emerging massive access channels. We further introduce recent advances in joint source and channel coding, highlighting its considerable performance advantage over separate source and channel coding in the non-asymptotic regime. In each part, we review various non-asymptotic achievability bounds, converse bounds, and approximations, as well as key ideas behind them, which are essential for providing engineering insights into the design of future wireless communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Fundamental Research -- Future Mobile Information Networks</p></details> |

GTMs extend multivariate transformation models by replacing the Gaussian copula with a custom-designed multivariate transformation, offering two major advantages. Firstly, GTMs can capture more complex interdependencies using penalized splines, which also provide an efficient regularization scheme. Secondly, we demonstrate how to approximately regularize GTMs using a lasso penalty towards pairwise conditional independencies, akin to Gaussian graphical models. The model's robustness and effectiveness are validated through simulations, showcasing its ability to accurately learn parametric vine copulas and identify conditional independencies. Additionally, the model is applied to a benchmark astrophysics dataset, where the GTM demonstrates favorable performance compared to non-parametric vine copulas in learning complex multivariate distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 Figures, presented at the DAGStat 2025 in Berlin</p></details> |

Their navigation systems rely heavily on fusing data from inertial sensors and a Doppler velocity log (DVL), typically via nonlinear filtering. The DVL estimates the AUV's velocity vector by transmitting acoustic beams to the seabed and analyzing the Doppler shift from the reflected signals. However, due to environmental challenges, DVL beams can deflect or fail in real-world settings, causing signal outages. In such cases, the AUV relies solely on inertial data, leading to accumulated navigation errors and mission terminations. To cope with these outages, we adopted ST-BeamsNet, a deep learning approach that uses inertial readings and prior DVL data to estimate AUV velocity during isolated outages. In this work, we extend ST-BeamsNet to address prolonged DVL outages and evaluate its impact within an extended Kalman filter framework. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework improves velocity RMSE by up to 63% and reduces final position error by up to 95% compared to pure inertial navigation. This is in scenarios involving up to 50 seconds of complete DVL outage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Eight...</summary><p>Eight pages, 7 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Distilling Knowledge from Heterogeneous Architectures for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07691v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current knowledge distillation (KD) methods for semantic segmentation focus on guiding the student to imitate the teacher's knowledge within homogeneous architectures. However, these methods overlook the diverse knowledge contained in architectures with different inductive biases, which is crucial for enabling the student to acquire a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the data during distillation. To this end, we propose for the first time a generic knowledge distillation method for semantic segmentation from a heterogeneous perspective, named HeteroAKD. Due to the substantial disparities between heterogeneous architectures, such as CNN and Transformer, directly transferring cross-architecture knowledge presents significant challenges. To eliminate the influence of architecture-specific information, the intermediate features of both the teacher and student are skillfully projected into an aligned logits space. Furthermore, to utilize diverse knowledge from heterogeneous architectures and deliver customized knowledge required by the student, a teacher-student knowledge mixing mechanism (KMM) and a teacher-student knowledge evaluation mechanism (KEM) are introduced. These mechanisms are performed by assessing the reliability and its discrepancy between heterogeneous teacher-student knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on three main-stream benchmarks using various teacher-student pairs demonstrate that our HeteroAKD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods in facilitating distillation between heterogeneous architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[GOLD: Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection via Implicit Adversarial Latent Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05780v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling graph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a great challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines.</p></details> | ICLR25 |

JPEG AI represents the latest standardized framework in this domain, leveraging deep neural networks for high-fidelity image reconstruction. In this study, we present a comprehensive subjective visual quality assessment of JPEG AI-compressed images using the JPEG AIC-3 methodology, which quantifies perceptual differences in terms of Just Noticeable Difference (JND) units. We generated a dataset of 50 compressed images with fine-grained distortion levels from five diverse sources. A large-scale crowdsourced experiment collected 96,200 triplet responses from 459 participants. We reconstructed JND-based quality scales using a unified model based on boosted and plain triplet comparisons. Additionally, we evaluated the alignment of multiple objective image quality metrics with human perception in the high-fidelity range. The CVVDP metric achieved the overall highest performance; however, most metrics including CVVDP were overly optimistic in predicting the quality of JPEG AI-compressed images. These findings emphasize the necessity for rigorous subjective evaluations in the development and benchmarking of modern image codecs, particularly in the high-fidelity range. Another technical contribution is the introduction of the well-known Meng-Rosenthal-Rubin statistical test to the field of Quality of Experience research. This test can reliably assess the significance of difference in performance of quality metrics in terms of correlation between metrics and ground truth. The complete dataset, including all subjective scores, is publicly available at https://github.com/jpeg-aic/dataset-JPEG-AI-SDR25.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, submitted to QoMEX 2025</p></details> |

However, learning a robust world model often requires complex and deep architectures, which are computationally expensive and challenging to train. Within the world model, sequence models play a critical role in accurate predictions, and various architectures have been explored, each with its own challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based world models struggle with vanishing gradients and capturing long-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, suffer from the quadratic memory and computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms, scaling as $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose a state space model (SSM)-based world model, Drama, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and enabling efficient training with longer sequences. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early training stages. Combining these techniques, Drama achieves a normalised score on the Atari100k benchmark that is competitive with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based RL algorithms, using only a 7 million-parameter world model. Drama is accessible and trainable on off-the-shelf hardware, such as a standard laptop.

We investigate its capabilities in providing high-quality programming tasks to students. Despite promising advancements in task generation, a quality gap remains between AI-generated and expert-created tasks. The AI-generated tasks may not align with target programming concepts, could be incomprehensible for students to solve, or may contain critical issues such as incorrect tests. Existing works often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in online resources.</p></details> | AIED'25 paper |
| **[Geometry-aware RL for Manipulation of Varying Shapes and Deformable Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07005v5)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.

Our approach bridges cage-based deformation and 3DGS by using a proxy point-cloud representation. This point cloud is generated from 3D Gaussians, and deformations applied to the point cloud are translated into transformations on the 3D Gaussians. To handle potential bending caused by deformation, we incorporate a splitting process to approximate it. Our method does not modify or extend the core architecture of 3D Gaussian Splatting, making it compatible with any trained vanilla 3DGS or its variants. Additionally, we automate cage construction for 3DGS and its variants using a render-and-reconstruct approach. Experiments demonstrate that GSDeformer delivers superior deformation results compared to existing methods, is robust under extreme deformations, requires no retraining for editing, runs in real-time, and can be extended to other 3DGS variants.

| **[Deep Learning Meets Teleconnections: Improving S2S Predictions for European Winter Weather](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07625v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictions on subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales--ranging from two weeks to two month--are crucial for early warning systems but remain challenging owing to chaos in the climate system. Teleconnections, such as the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), offer windows of enhanced predictability, however, their complex interactions remain underutilized in operational forecasting. Here, we developed and evaluated deep learning architectures to predict North Atlantic-European (NAE) weather regimes, systematically assessing the role of remote drivers in improving S2S forecast skill of deep learning models. We implemented (1) a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network predicting the NAE regimes of the next six weeks based on previous regimes, (2) an Index-LSTM incorporating SPV and MJO indices, and (3) a ViT-LSTM using a Vision Transformer to directly encode stratospheric wind and tropical outgoing longwave radiation fields. These models are compared with operational hindcasts as well as other AI models. Our results show that leveraging teleconnection information enhances skill at longer lead times. Notably, the ViT-LSTM outperforms ECMWF's subseasonal hindcasts beyond week 4 by improving Scandinavian Blocking (SB) and Atlantic Ridge (AR) predictions. Analysis of high-confidence predictions reveals that NAO-, SB, and AR opportunity forecasts can be associated with SPV variability and MJO phase patterns aligning with established pathways, also indicating new patterns. Overall, our work demonstrates that encoding physically meaningful climate fields can enhance S2S prediction skill, advancing AI-driven subseasonal forecast. Moreover, the experiments highlight the potential of deep learning methods as investigative tools, providing new insights into atmospheric dynamics and predictability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 18 million deaths happen each year due to precisely heart diseases. In particular, heart failures (HF) press the healthcare industry to develop systems for their early, rapid and effective prediction. In this work, an automatic system which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences is proposed for the challenging and more specific task of prediction of heart failure times. This system is based on a novel deep learning framework, and works in two stages. The first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography video sequences into a machine learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training phase of any kind of machine learning-based framework, including a deep learning one. This initial stage includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm for both data augmentation and feature extraction. The second stage is focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT). Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which have been so far barely explored in the literature about heart failure prediction, are applied to effectively train the ViT from scratch, even with scarce databases of echocardiograms. The designed neural network analyses images from echocardiography sequences to estimate the time in which a heart failure will happen. The results obtained show the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm and the superiority of the proposed system with respect to several established ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 7 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2404.19579</p></details> |

Recent advancements in self-supervised pretraining have led to the development of robust gait recognition models that are invariant to walking covariates. While neural scaling laws have transformed model development in other domains by linking performance to data, model size, and compute, their applicability to gait remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study scaling on skeleton-based self-supervised gait recognition to quantify the effect of data quantity, model size and compute on downstream gait recognition performance. We pretrain multiple variants of GaitPT - a transformer-based architecture - on a dataset of 2.7 million walking sequences collected in the wild. We evaluate zero-shot performance across four benchmark datasets to derive scaling laws for data, model size, and compute. Our findings demonstrate predictable power-law improvements in performance with increased scale and confirm that data and compute scaling significantly influence downstream accuracy. We further isolate architectural contributions by comparing GaitPT with GaitFormer under controlled compute budgets. These results provide practical insights into resource allocation and performance estimation for real-world gait recognition systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 Figures, 3 Tables</p></details> |

Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In addition, we extend Latte to text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where Latte achieves comparable results compared to recent T2V models. We strongly believe that Latte provides valuable insights for future research on incorporating Transformers into diffusion models for video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research 2025; Project page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/latte_project</p></details> |

Our study spans embeddings from pre-trained convolutional and transformer models trained via supervised, self-supervised, and text-image contrastive learning. We assess full fine-tuning and transfer learning (top-tuning) on six diverse e-Commerce datasets: fashion, consumer goods, cars, food, and retail. Results show full fine-tuning consistently performs well, while text-image and self-supervised embeddings can match its performance with less training. While supervised embeddings remain stable across architectures, SSL and contrastive embeddings vary significantly, often benefiting from top-tuning. Top-tuning emerges as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, reducing computational costs. We also explore cross-tuning, noting its impact depends on dataset characteristics. Our findings offer practical guidelines for embedding selection and fine-tuning strategies, balancing efficiency and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Future Technologies Conference (FTC 2025)</p></details> |

However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 19 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

The in-paint MPA (IP-MPA) is designed for the Internet of Paint (IoP) paradigm, which envisions seamless device communication through a paint layer on walls. This study introduces a comprehensive channel model for transceivers in paint at arbitrary depths and IP-MPA orientations. The best antenna orientations are analyzed for IoP channel performance. Extensive simulations indicate that the lateral waves, which propagate along the air-paint interface, exhibit the lowest loss, making this path the most reliable for communication between transceivers in paint. Further, the maximum received power for each propagation path, with the exception of the direct path, depends on depth. The findings suggest that the proposed network of IP-MPA-enabled transceivers for IoP has the potential to transform conventional walls into an integrated high-speed wireless communication and sensing infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 Figures, 3 Tables, Conference</p></details> |
| **[Rendering Large Volume Datasets in Unreal Engine 5: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07485v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this technical report, we discuss several approaches to in-core rendering of large volumetric datasets in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). We explore the following methods: the TBRayMarcher Plugin, the Niagara Fluids Plugin , and various approaches using Sparse Volume Textures (SVT), with a particular focus on Heterogeneous Volumes (HV). We found the HV approach to be the most promising. The biggest challenge we encountered with other approaches was the need to chunk datasets so that each fits into volume textures smaller than one gigavoxel. While this enables display of the entire dataset at reasonable frame rates, it introduces noticeable artifacts at chunk borders due to incorrect lighting, as each chunk lacks information about its neighbors. After addressing some (signed) int32 overflows in the Engine's SVT-related source code by converting them to to (unsigned) uint32 or int64, the SVT-based HV system allows us to render sparse datasets up to 32k x 32k x 16k voxels, provided the compressed tile data (including MIP data and padding for correct interpolation) does not exceed 4 gigavoxels. In the future, we intend to extend the existing SVT streaming functionality to support out-of-core rendering, in order to eventually overcome VRAM limitations, graphics API constraints, and the performance issues associated with 64-bit arithmetic in GPU shaders.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Toward a Theory of Tokenization in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08335v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been a large body of research attempting to circumvent tokenization for language modeling (Clark et al., 2022; Xue et al., 2022), the current consensus is that it is a necessary initial step for designing state-of-the-art performant language models. In this paper, we investigate tokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of transformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn from certain simple $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k > 1$, transformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization, they empirically fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters according to a unigram model (Makkuva et al., 2024). With the addition of tokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through this barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from the source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this observation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss achieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate tokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens) learnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn from $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally. Our analysis provides a justification for the use of tokenization in practice through studying the behavior of transformers on Markovian data.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 11 figures.

Automatic Pneumonia detection from CXR images by deep learning model has emerged as a prominent and dynamic area of research, since the inception of the new Covid-19 variant in 2020. However, the standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models encounter challenges associated with class imbalance, a prevalent issue found in many medical datasets. The innovations introduced in the proposed model architecture include: (I) A very lightweight CNN model, `VGG-Lite', is proposed as a base model, inspired by VGG-16 and MobileNet-V2 architecture. (II) On top of this base model, we leverage an ``Edge Enhanced Module (EEM)" through a parallel branch, consisting of a ``negative image layer", and a novel custom pooling layer ``2Max-Min Pooling". This 2Max-Min Pooling layer is entirely novel in this investigation, providing more attention to edge components within pneumonia CXR images. Thus, it works as an efficient spatial attention module (SAM). We have implemented the proposed framework on two separate CXR datasets. The first dataset is obtained from a readily available source on the internet, and the second dataset is a more challenging CXR dataset, assembled by our research team from three different sources. Experimental results reveal that our proposed framework has outperformed pre-trained CNN models, and three recent trend existing models ``Vision Transformer", ``Pooling-based Vision Transformer (PiT)'' and ``PneuNet", by substantial margins on both datasets. The proposed framework VGG-Lite with EEM, has achieved a macro average of 95% accuracy, 97.1% precision, 96.1% recall, and 96.6% F1 score on the ``Pneumonia Imbalance CXR dataset", without employing any pre-processing technique.</p></details> | 12 pages |

They are appealing for developing fast reference libraries without double rounding issues. The key insight is to build polynomials that produce the correctly rounded result for a representation with two additional bits when compared to the largest target representation and with the "non-standard" round-to-odd rounding mode, which makes double rounding the RLibm math library result to any smaller target representation innocuous. The resulting approximations generated by the RLibm approach are implemented with machine supported floating-point operations with the round-to-nearest rounding mode. When an application uses a rounding mode other than the round-to-nearest mode, the RLibm math library saves the application's rounding mode, changes the system's rounding mode to round-to-nearest, computes the correctly rounded result, and restores the application's rounding mode. This frequent change of rounding modes has a performance cost. This paper proposes two new methods, which we call rounding-invariant outputs and rounding-invariant input bounds, to avoid the frequent changes to the rounding mode and the dependence on the round-to-nearest mode. First, our new rounding-invariant outputs method proposes using the round-to-zero rounding mode to implement RLibm's polynomial approximations. We propose fast, error-free transformations to emulate a round-to-zero result from any standard rounding mode without changing the rounding mode. Second, our rounding-invariant input bounds method factors any rounding error due to different rounding modes using interval bounds in the RLibm pipeline. Both methods make a different set of trade-offs and improve the performance of resulting libraries by more than 2X.</p></details> | 31 pages |

| **[Dynamic Cheatsheet: Test-Time Learning with Adaptive Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07952v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive performance on complex tasks, current language models (LMs) typically operate in a vacuum: Each input query is processed separately, without retaining insights from previous attempts. Here, we present Dynamic Cheatsheet (DC), a lightweight framework that endows a black-box LM with a persistent, evolving memory. Rather than repeatedly re-discovering or re-committing the same solutions and mistakes, DC enables models to store and reuse accumulated strategies, code snippets, and general problem-solving insights at inference time. This test-time learning enhances performance substantially across a range of tasks without needing explicit ground-truth labels or human feedback. Leveraging DC, Claude 3.5 Sonnet's accuracy more than doubled on AIME math exams once it began retaining algebraic insights across questions. Similarly, GPT-4o's success rate on Game of 24 increased from 10% to 99% after the model discovered and reused a Python-based solution. In tasks prone to arithmetic mistakes, such as balancing equations, DC enabled GPT-4o and Claude to reach near-perfect accuracy by recalling previously validated code, whereas their baselines stagnated around 50%. Beyond arithmetic challenges, DC yields notable accuracy gains on knowledge-demanding tasks. Claude achieved a 9% improvement in GPQA-Diamond and an 8% boost on MMLU-Pro problems. Crucially, DC's memory is self-curated, focusing on concise, transferable snippets rather than entire transcript. Unlike finetuning or static retrieval methods, DC adapts LMs' problem-solving skills on the fly, without modifying their underlying parameters. Overall, our findings present DC as a promising approach for augmenting LMs with persistent memory, bridging the divide between isolated inference events and the cumulative, experience-driven learning characteristic of human cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/suzgunmirac/dynamic-cheatsheet</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Optimization Over Uncertainty via Compilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18728v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic inference is fundamentally hard, yet many tasks require optimization on top of inference, which is even harder. We present a new optimization-via-compilation strategy to scalably solve a certain class of such problems. In particular, we introduce a new intermediate representation (IR), binary decision diagrams weighted by a novel notion of branch-and-bound semiring, that enables a scalable branch-and-bound based optimization procedure. This IR automatically factorizes problems through program structure and prunes suboptimal values via a straightforward branch-and-bound style algorithm to find optima. Additionally, the IR is naturally amenable to staged compilation, allowing the programmer to query for optima mid-compilation to inform further executions of the program. We showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of the IR by implementing two performant languages that both compile to it: dappl and pineappl. dappl is a functional language that solves maximum expected utility problems with first-class support for rewards, decision making, and conditioning. pineappl is an imperative language that performs exact probabilistic inference with support for nested marginal maximum a posteriori (MMAP) optimization via staging.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 23 Figures, Accepted to OOPSLA R1</p></details> |

Existing 3D part segmentation methods only identify visible surface patches, limiting their utility. Inspired by 2D amodal segmentation, we introduce this novel task to the 3D domain and propose a practical, two-stage approach, addressing the key challenges of inferring occluded 3D geometry, maintaining global shape consistency, and handling diverse shapes with limited training data. First, we leverage existing 3D part segmentation to obtain initial, incomplete part segments. Second, we introduce HoloPart, a novel diffusion-based model, to complete these segments into full 3D parts. HoloPart utilizes a specialized architecture with local attention to capture fine-grained part geometry and global shape context attention to ensure overall shape consistency. We introduce new benchmarks based on the ABO and PartObjaverse-Tiny datasets and demonstrate that HoloPart significantly outperforms state-of-the-art shape completion methods. By incorporating HoloPart with existing segmentation techniques, we achieve promising results on 3D part amodal segmentation, opening new avenues for applications in geometry editing, animation, and material assignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vast-ai-research.github.io/HoloPart</p></details> |
| **[Semantically Encoding Activity Labels for Context-Aware Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07916v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior work has primarily formulated CA-HAR as a multi-label classification problem, where model inputs are time-series sensor data and target labels are binary encodings representing whether a given activity or context occurs. These CA-HAR methods either predicted each label independently or manually imposed relationships using graphs. However, both strategies often neglect an essential aspect: activity labels have rich semantic relationships. For instance, walking, jogging, and running activities share similar movement patterns but differ in pace and intensity, indicating that they are semantically related. Consequently, prior CA-HAR methods often struggled to accurately capture these inherent and nuanced relationships, particularly on datasets with noisy labels typically used for CA-HAR or situations where the ideal sensor type is unavailable (e.g., recognizing speech without audio sensors). To address this limitation, we propose SEAL, which leverage LMs to encode CA-HAR activity labels to capture semantic relationships. LMs generate vector embeddings that preserve rich semantic information from natural language. Our SEAL approach encodes input-time series sensor data from smart devices and their associated activity and context labels (text) as vector embeddings. During training, SEAL aligns the sensor data representations with their corresponding activity/context label embeddings in a shared embedding space. At inference time, SEAL performs a similarity search, returning the CA-HAR label with the embedding representation closest to the input data. Although LMs have been widely explored in other domains, surprisingly, their potential in CA-HAR has been underexplored, making our approach a novel contribution to the field. Our research opens up new possibilities for integrating more advanced LMs into CA-HAR tasks.</p></details> | Percom 2025 |
| **[Fast Adaptation with Behavioral Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07896v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning. This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Token Level Routing Inference System for Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07878v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational complexity of large language model (LLM) inference significantly constrains their deployment efficiency on edge devices. In contrast, small language models offer faster decoding and lower resource consumption but often suffer from degraded response quality and heightened susceptibility to hallucinations. To address this trade-off, collaborative decoding, in which a large model assists in generating critical tokens, has emerged as a promising solution. This paradigm leverages the strengths of both model types by enabling high-quality inference through selective intervention of the large model, while maintaining the speed and efficiency of the smaller model. In this work, we present a novel collaborative decoding inference system that allows small models to perform on-device inference while selectively consulting a cloud-based large model for critical token generation. Remarkably, the system achieves a 60% performance gain on CommonsenseQA using only a 0.5B model on an M1 MacBook, with under 7% of tokens generation uploaded to the large model in the cloud.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, under review of ACL system demo</p></details> |

This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Event-Triggered Source Seeking Control for Nonholonomic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07797v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an event-triggered source seeking control (ET-SSC) for autonomous vehicles modeled as the nonholonomic unicycle. The classical source seeking control is enhanced with static-triggering conditions to enable aperiodic and less frequent updates of the system's input signals, offering a resource-aware control design. Our convergence analysis is based on time-scaling combined with Lyapunov and averaging theories for systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. ET-SSC ensures exponentially stable behavior for the resulting average system, leading to practical asymptotic convergence to a small neighborhood of the source point. We guarantee the avoidance of Zeno behavior by establishing a minimum dwell time to prevent infinitely fast switching. The performance optimization is aligned with classical continuous-time source seeking algorithms while balancing system performance with actuation resource consumption. Our ET-SSC algorithm, the first of its kind, allows for arbitrarily large inter-sampling times, overcoming the limitations of classical sampled-data implementations for source seeking control.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fairness Mediator: Neutralize Stereotype Associations to Mitigate Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07787v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse applications, yet they inadvertently absorb spurious correlations from training data, leading to stereotype associations between biased concepts and specific social groups. These associations perpetuate and even amplify harmful social biases, raising significant fairness concerns. To mitigate such biases, prior studies have attempted to project model embeddings into unbiased spaces during inference. However, these approaches have shown limited effectiveness due to their weak alignment with downstream social biases. Inspired by the observation that concept cognition in LLMs is primarily represented through a linear associative memory mechanism, where key-value mapping occurs in the MLP layers, we posited that biased concepts and social groups are similarly encoded as entity (key) and information (value) pairs, which can be manipulated to promote fairer associations. To this end, we propose Fairness Mediator (FairMed), a bias mitigation framework that neutralizes stereotype associations. Our framework comprises two main components: a stereotype association prober and an adversarial debiasing neutralizer. The prober captures stereotype associations encoded within MLP layer activations by employing prompts centered around biased concepts to detect the emission probabilities for social groups. Subsequently, the adversarial debiasing neutralizer intervenes in MLP activations during inference to equalize the association probabilities among different social groups. Extensive experiments across nine protected attributes show that FairMed significantly outperforms SOTA methods in effectiveness. Compared to the most effective baseline, FairMed presents competitive efficiency by cutting mitigation overhead by hundreds of minutes. FairMed also maintains the LLM's language understanding capabilities without compromising overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA 2025.20 pages</p></details> |

In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes, contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different observational modes.</p></details> | Accepted by the AJ |

This study presents an efficient alternative, a deep learning-based surrogate model built using a modified U-Net architecture to predict the dynamics of runoff-generated debris flows across diverse terrain based on data from physics based simulations. The study area is divided into smaller patches for localized predictions using a patch-predict-stitch methodology (complemented by limited global data to accelerate training). The patches are then combined to reconstruct spatially continuous flow maps, ensuring scalability for large domains. To enable fast training using limited expensive simulations, the deep learning model was trained on data from an ensemble of physics based simulations using parameters generated via Latin Hypercube Sampling and validated on unseen parameter sets and terrain, achieving maximum pointwise errors below 10% and robust generalization. Uncertainty quantification using Monte Carlo methods are enabled using the validated surrogate, which can facilitate probabilistic hazard assessments. This study highlights the potential of deep learning surrogates as powerful tools for geophysical flow analysis, enabling computationally efficient and reliable probabilistic hazard map predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Computers & Geosciences, 22 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

A key challenge is the lack of model-based design tools, forcing advancement to occur through empirical iteration and observation. Existing models are focused on control and rely on parameter fits, which means they cannot provide general conclusions about the mapping between design and performance or the influence of factors outside the fitting data.As a first step toward model-based design tools, we introduce a novel method of analyzing whether a proposed arm design can complete desired tasks. Our method is informative, interpretable, and fast; it provides novel metrics for quantifying a proposed arm design's ability to perform a task, it yields a graphical interpretation of performance through segment forces, and computing it is over 80x faster than optimization based methods.Our formulation focuses on antagonistic, pneumatically-driven soft arms. We demonstrate our approach through example analysis, and also through consideration of antagonistic vs non-antagonistic designs. Our method enables fast, direct and task-specific comparison of these two architectures, and provides a new visualization of the comparative mechanics. While only a first step, the proposed approach will support advancement of model-based design tools, leading to highly capable soft arms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

However, the main challenge in implementing ECA lies in accessing real-world or historical clinical trials data. Indeed, regulations protecting patients' rights by strictly controlling data processing make pooling data from multiple sources in a central server often difficult. To address these limitations, we develop a new method, 'FedECA' that leverages federated learning (FL) to enable inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) for time-to-event outcomes on separate cohorts without needing to pool data. To showcase the potential of FedECA, we apply it in different settings of increasing complexity culminating with a real-world use-case in which FedECA is used to compare the treatment effect of two approved chemotherapy regimens using data from three separate cohorts of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. By sharing our code, we hope FedECA will foster the creation of federated research networks and thus accelerate drug development.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code available at: https://github.com/owkin/fedeca, bug in SMD present in v1 and v2 fixed, experiments on real data added + fix in YODA experiments (v3->v4) + affiliations fix + more precise wording for acknowledgments, real-world experiment results fixed by excluding data with bias + text polished (v5->v6) + updating abs(v6->v7)+ typo (v7->v8)</p></details> |

Aligning Language Models through Edit-Based Writing Rewards and Test-time Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07532v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.</p></details> | Under Submission |
| **[Fast Globally Optimal and Geometrically Consistent 3D Shape Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06385v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric consistency, i.e. the preservation of neighbourhoods, is a natural and strong prior in 3D shape matching. Geometrically consistent matchings are crucial for many downstream applications, such as texture transfer or statistical shape modelling. Yet, in practice, geometric consistency is often overlooked, or only achieved under severely limiting assumptions (e.g. a good initialisation). In this work, we propose a novel formalism for computing globally optimal and geometrically consistent matchings between 3D shapes which is scalable in practice. Our key idea is to represent the surface of the source shape as a collection of cyclic paths, which are then consistently matched to the target shape. Mathematically, we construct a hyper product graph (between source and target shape), and then cast 3D shape matching as a minimum-cost circulation flow problem in this hyper graph, which yields global geometrically consistent matchings between both shapes. We empirically show that our formalism is efficiently solvable and that it leads to high-quality results.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main paper, 10 pages supplementary</p></details> |

RK accesses and processes just one row at a time, leading to exponentially fast convergence for consistent linear systems. However, RK fails to converge to the least-squares solution for inconsistent systems. This work presents a simple fix: average the RK iterates produced in the tail part of the algorithm. The proposed tail-averaged randomized Kaczmarz (TARK) converges for both consistent and inconsistent least-squares problems at a polynomial rate, which is known to be optimal for any row-access method. An extension of TARK also leads to efficient solutions for ridge-regularized least-squares problems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 2 figures |

The Collaboration-of-Experts (CoE) approach integrates multiple expert models, improving the accuracy of generated results and offering great potential for precision-critical applications, such as automatic circuit board quality inspection. However, deploying CoE serving systems presents challenges to memory capacity due to the large number of experts required, which can lead to significant performance overhead from frequent expert switching across different memory and storage tiers. We propose CoServe, an efficient CoE model serving system on heterogeneous CPU and GPU with limited memory. CoServe reduces unnecessary expert switching by leveraging expert dependency, a key property of CoE inference. CoServe introduces a dependency-aware request scheduler and dependency-aware expert management for efficient inference. It also introduces an offline profiler to automatically find optimal resource allocation on various processors and devices. In real-world intelligent manufacturing workloads, CoServe achieves 4.5$\times$ to 12$\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS '25)</p></details> |

While Small Language Models (SLMs) offer faster inference speeds with fewer parameters, they often compromise accuracy on complex tasks. This study proposes a novel remote inference system comprising a user, a sensor, and an edge server that integrates both model types alongside a decision maker. The system dynamically determines the resolution of images transmitted by the sensor and routes inference tasks to either an SLM or LLM to optimize performance. The key objective is to minimize the Task-oriented Age of Information (TAoI) by jointly considering the accuracy and timeliness of the inference task. Due to the non-uniform transmission time and inference time, we formulate this problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP). By converting the SMDP to an equivalent Markov decision process, we prove that the optimal control policy follows a threshold-based structure. We further develop a relative policy iteration algorithm leveraging this threshold property. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed optimal policy significantly outperforms baseline approaches in managing the accuracy-timeliness trade-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICCCS 2025</p></details> |

They are appealing for developing fast reference libraries without double rounding issues. The key insight is to build polynomials that produce the correctly rounded result for a representation with two additional bits when compared to the largest target representation and with the "non-standard" round-to-odd rounding mode, which makes double rounding the RLibm math library result to any smaller target representation innocuous. The resulting approximations generated by the RLibm approach are implemented with machine supported floating-point operations with the round-to-nearest rounding mode. When an application uses a rounding mode other than the round-to-nearest mode, the RLibm math library saves the application's rounding mode, changes the system's rounding mode to round-to-nearest, computes the correctly rounded result, and restores the application's rounding mode. This frequent change of rounding modes has a performance cost. This paper proposes two new methods, which we call rounding-invariant outputs and rounding-invariant input bounds, to avoid the frequent changes to the rounding mode and the dependence on the round-to-nearest mode. First, our new rounding-invariant outputs method proposes using the round-to-zero rounding mode to implement RLibm's polynomial approximations. We propose fast, error-free transformations to emulate a round-to-zero result from any standard rounding mode without changing the rounding mode. Second, our rounding-invariant input bounds method factors any rounding error due to different rounding modes using interval bounds in the RLibm pipeline. Both methods make a different set of trade-offs and improve the performance of resulting libraries by more than 2X.</p></details> | 31 pages |

They describe conditionally independent divergent evolution of taxa from common ancestors. Phylogenetic trees commonly do not have enough flexibility to adequately model all evolutionary processes. For example, introgressive hybridization, where genes can flow from one taxon to another. Phylogenetic networks model evolution not fully described by a phylogenetic tree. However, many phylogenetic network models assume ancestral taxa merge instantaneously to form ``hybrid'' descendant taxa. In contrast, our convergence-divergence models retain a single underlying ``principal'' tree, but permit gene flow over arbitrary time frames. Alternatively, convergence-divergence models can describe other biological processes leading to taxa becoming more similar over a time frame, such as replicated evolution. Here we present novel maximum likelihood-based algorithms to infer most aspects of $N$-taxon convergence-divergence models, many consistently, using a quartet-based approach. The algorithms can be applied to multiple sequence alignments restricted to genes or genomic windows or to gene presence/absence datasets.</p></details> | 73 pages, 9 figures |

Language for Weakly Supervising View Selection in Multi-view Instructional Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08753v4)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a multi-view video, which viewpoint is most informative for a human observer? Existing methods rely on heuristics or expensive "best-view" supervision to answer this question, limiting their applicability. We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages language accompanying an instructional multi-view video as a means to recover its most informative viewpoint(s). Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view can predict a view-agnostic text summary, the more informative it is. To put this into action, we propose LangView, a framework that uses the relative accuracy of view-dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view pseudo-labels. Then, those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector, together with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances view-sensitivity. During inference, our model takes as input only a multi-view video--no language or camera poses--and returns the best viewpoint to watch at each timestep. On two challenging datasets comprised of diverse multi-camera setups and how-to activities, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both with quantitative metrics and human evaluation.

In this work, we introduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8, OpenWebText, and token-based image generation on ImageNet $256 \times 256$. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are significantly longer than the ones seen during training, while enjoying faster inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Offic...</summary><p>Official Implementation: https://github.com/assafbk/DeciMamba</p></details> |

Methods like ControlNet and T2I-Adapter excel at following sketches by seasoned artists but tend to be overly rigid, replicating unintentional flaws in sketches from novice users. Meanwhile, coarse-grained methods, such as sketch-based abstraction frameworks, offer more accessible input handling but lack the precise control needed for detailed, professional use. To address these limitations, we propose KnobGen, a dual-pathway framework that democratizes sketch-based image generation by seamlessly adapting to varying levels of sketch complexity and user skill. KnobGen uses a Coarse-Grained Controller (CGC) module for high-level semantics and a Fine-Grained Controller (FGC) module for detailed refinement. The relative strength of these two modules can be adjusted through our knob inference mechanism to align with the user's specific needs. These mechanisms ensure that KnobGen can flexibly generate images from both novice sketches and those drawn by seasoned artists. This maintains control over the final output while preserving the natural appearance of the image, as evidenced on the MultiGen-20M dataset and a newly collected sketch dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025 Workshop on CVEU</p></details> |

The particles interact through Coulomb forces mediated by the surrounding plasma, and as a result, the effective forces between particles can be non-conservative and non-reciprocal. Machine learning (ML) models are a promising route to learn these complex forces, yet their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. Here we demonstrate and experimentally validate an ML approach that incorporates physical intuition to infer force laws in a laboratory dusty plasma. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries, non-identical particles, and learns the effective non-reciprocal forces between particles with exquisite accuracy (R^2>0.99). We validate the model by inferring particle masses in two independent yet consistent ways. The model's accuracy enables precise measurements of particle charge and screening length, discovering large deviations from common theoretical assumptions. Our ability to identify new physics from experimental data demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems. Furthermore, we anticipate our ML approach to be a starting point for inferring laws from dynamics in a wide range of many-body systems, from colloids to living organisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 Figures, 2 Supplemental Figures, 8 Supplemental Videos</p></details> |
| **[Tensor Product Attention Is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06425v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically necessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention (TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent queries, keys, and values compactly, significantly shrinking KV cache size at inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual low-rank components (contextual factorization) and seamlessly integrating with RoPE, TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based on TPA, we introduce the Tensor ProducT ATTenTion Transformer (T6), a new model architecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation of language modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 exceeds the performance of standard Transformer baselines including MHA, MQA, GQA, and MLA across various metrics, including perplexity and a range of renowned evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory efficiency enables the processing of significantly longer sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical scalability challenge in modern language models.

The proposed discretization scheme is based on a space-time variational formulation of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. In particular, the space-time method is conforming and is of Galerkin-type, i.e., trial and test spaces are equal. We consider a tensor-product approach with respect to time and space, using piecewise polynomial, continuous trial and test functions. In this case, we state the global linear system and efficient direct space-time solvers based on exploiting the Kronecker structure of the global system matrix. This leads to the Bartels-Stewart method and the fast diagonalization method. Both methods result in solving a sequence of spatial subproblems. In particular, the fast diagonalization method allows for solving the spatial subproblems in parallel, i.e., a time parallelization is possible. Numerical examples for a two-dimensional spatial domain illustrate convergence in space-time norms and show the potential of the proposed solvers.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Almost all of these algorithms are designed to process sequences of complex-valued data when each element of the sequence represents a single whole. However, in some cases, it is more advantageous to represent each element of the input and output sequences by a pair of real numbers. Such a need arises, for example, when further post-processing of spectral coefficients is carried out through two independent channels. Taking into account the noted need, the article proposes an algorithm for fast complex-valued discrete Fourier transform with separate real and imaginary inputs/outputs. A vector-matrix computational procedure is given that allows one to adequately describe and formalize the sequence of calculations when implementing the proposed algorithm.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

To overcome the problem of ill-posedness due to lack of regularity, we consider a semi-discrete scheme by adding a viscosity term via finite differences in space. We prove that PI for the semi-discrete scheme converges exponentially fast, and provide a bound on the error induced by the semi-discrete scheme. We also consider the discrete space-time scheme, where both space and time are discretized. Convergence rate of PI and the discretization error are studied.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages.

| **[Better Decisions through the Right Causal World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07257v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have shown remarkable performances in various environments, where they can discover effective policies directly from sensory inputs. However, these agents often exploit spurious correlations in the training data, resulting in brittle behaviours that fail to generalize to new or slightly modified environments. To address this, we introduce the Causal Object-centric Model Extraction Tool (COMET), a novel algorithm designed to learn the exact interpretable causal world models (CWMs). COMET first extracts object-centric state descriptions from observations and identifies the environment's internal states related to the depicted objects' properties. Using symbolic regression, it models object-centric transitions and derives causal relationships governing object dynamics. COMET further incorporates large language models (LLMs) for semantic inference, annotating causal variables to enhance interpretability. By leveraging these capabilities, COMET constructs CWMs that align with the true causal structure of the environment, enabling agents to focus on task-relevant features. The extracted CWMs mitigate the danger of shortcuts, permitting the development of RL systems capable of better planning and decision-making across dynamic scenarios. Our results, validated in Atari environments such as Pong and Freeway, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of COMET, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between object-centric reasoning and causal inference in reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages including references, 2 figures</p></details> |

We illustrate why the true mutual information between a variable and the predictions made by a prediction algorithm is not a suitable measure of prediction quality, but the apparent Shannon mutual information (ASI) is; indeed it is the unique prediction quality measure with either of two very different lists of desirable properties, as previously shown by de Finetti and other authors. However, estimating the uncertainty of the ASI is a difficult problem, because of long and non-symmetric heavy tails to the distribution of the individual values of $j(x,y)=\log\frac{Q_y(x)}{P(x)}$ We propose a Bayesian modelling method for the distribution of $j(x,y)$, from the posterior distribution of which the uncertainty in the ASI can be inferred. This method is based on Dirichlet-based mixtures of skew-Student distributions. We illustrate its use on data from a Bayesian model for prediction of the recurrence time of prostate cancer. We believe that this approach is generally appropriate for most problems, where it is infeasible to derive the explicit distribution of the samples of $j(x,y)$, though the precise modelling parameters may need adjustment to suit particular cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures; v5 fixes reference numbering and missing details for reference 13, and author list in metadata</p></details> |

However, directly inverting propensity score estimates can lead to instability, bias, and excessive variability due to large inverse weights, especially when treatment overlap is limited. In this work, we propose a post-hoc calibration algorithm for inverse propensity weights that generates well-calibrated, stabilized weights from user-supplied, cross-fitted propensity score estimates. Our approach employs a variant of isotonic regression with a loss function specifically tailored to the inverse propensity weights. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we demonstrate that isotonic calibration improves the performance of doubly robust estimators of the average treatment effect.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CLeaR conference (2025).

| **[Let SSMs be ConvNets: State-space Modeling with Optimal Tensor Contractions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13230v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Centaurus, a class of networks composed of generalized state-space model (SSM) blocks, where the SSM operations can be treated as tensor contractions during training. The optimal order of tensor contractions can then be systematically determined for every SSM block to maximize training efficiency. This allows more flexibility in designing SSM blocks beyond the depthwise-separable configuration commonly implemented. The new design choices will take inspiration from classical convolutional blocks including group convolutions, full convolutions, and bottleneck blocks. We architect the Centaurus network with a mixture of these blocks, to balance between network size and performance, as well as memory and computational efficiency during both training and inference. We show that this heterogeneous network design outperforms its homogeneous counterparts in raw audio processing tasks including keyword spotting, speech denoising, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). For ASR, Centaurus is the first network with competitive performance that can be made fully state-space based, without using any nonlinear recurrence (LSTMs), explicit convolutions (CNNs), or (surrogate) attention mechanism.

Despite various proposed defenses, these involve costly hardware solutions with inherent physical limitations. This paper presents EveGuard, a software-driven defense framework that creates adversarial audio, protecting voice privacy from side channels without compromising human perception. We leverage the distinct sensing capabilities of side channels and traditional microphones, where side channels capture vibrations and microphones record changes in air pressure, resulting in different frequency responses. EveGuard first proposes a perturbation generator model (PGM) that effectively suppresses sensor-based eavesdropping while maintaining high audio quality. Second, to enable end-to-end training of PGM, we introduce a new domain translation task called Eve-GAN for inferring an eavesdropped signal from a given audio. We further apply few-shot learning to mitigate the data collection overhead for Eve-GAN training. Our extensive experiments show that EveGuard achieves a protection rate of more than 97 percent from audio classifiers and significantly hinders eavesdropped audio reconstruction. We further validate the performance of EveGuard across three adaptive attack mechanisms. We have conducted a user study to verify the perceptual quality of our perturbed audio.</p></details> | <details><summary>In th...</summary><p>In the 46th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (IEEE S&P), May 2025</p></details> |
| **[Implied Integrality in Mixed-Integer Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07209v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implied-integer detection is a well-known presolving technique that is used by many Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solvers. Informally, a variable is said to be implied integer if its integrality is enforced implicitly by integrality of other variables and the constraints of a problem. In this paper we formalize the definition of implied integrality by taking a polyhedral perspective. Our main result characterizes implied integrality as occurring when a subset of integer variables is fixed to integer values and the polyhedron on the remaining variables is integral. While integral polyhedra are well-understood theoretically, existing detection methods infer implied integrality only for one variable at a time. We introduce new detection methods based on the detection of integral polyhedra, extending existing techniques to multiple variables. Additionally, we discuss the computational complexity of recognizing implied integers. We conduct experiments using a new detection method that uses totally unimodular submatrices to identify implied integrality. For the MIPLIB 2017 collection dataset our results indicate that, on average, 18.8% of the variables are classified as implied integer after presolving, compared to just 3.3% identified by state-of-the-art techniques. We are able to reduce the average percentage of variables whose integrality needs to be enforced after presolving from 70.2% to 59.0%.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, IPCO 2025 journal version with proofs</p></details> |

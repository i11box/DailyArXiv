| **[WarpRF: Multi-View Consistency for Training-Free Uncertainty Quantification and Applications in Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22433v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free. WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g., active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method tailored to specific frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kuis-ai.github.io/WarpRF/</p></details> |
| **[CLoVE: Personalized Federated Learning through Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22427v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings, and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and unsupervised PFL tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Vision Transformers Don't Need Trained Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08010v4)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and code: https://avdravid.github.io/test-time-registers</p></details> |

| **[L2MAC: Large Language Model Automatic Computer for Extensive Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02003v6)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are constrained by the fixed context window of the underlying transformer architecture, hindering their ability to produce long and coherent outputs. Memory-augmented LLMs are a promising solution, but current approaches cannot handle long output generation tasks since they (1) only focus on reading memory and reduce its evolution to the concatenation of new memories or (2) use very specialized memories that cannot adapt to other domains. This paper presents L2MAC, the first practical LLM-based general-purpose stored-program automatic computer (von Neumann architecture) framework, an LLM-based multi-agent system, for long and consistent output generation. Its memory has two components: the instruction registry, which is populated with a prompt program to solve the user-given task, and a file store, which will contain the final and intermediate outputs. Each instruction in turn is executed by a separate LLM agent, whose context is managed by a control unit capable of precise memory reading and writing to ensure effective interaction with the file store. These components enable L2MAC to generate extensive outputs, bypassing the constraints of the finite context window while producing outputs that fulfill a complex user-specified task. We empirically demonstrate that L2MAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating large codebases for system design tasks, significantly outperforming other coding methods in implementing the detailed user-specified task; we show that L2MAC works for general-purpose extensive text-based tasks, such as writing an entire book; and we provide valuable insights into L2MAC's performance improvement over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2024.

| **[Sequential Diagnosis with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22405v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians, proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value, cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80% diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in clinical care.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[HyperCLOVA X THINK Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22403v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.</p></details> | 49 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Refining Czech GEC: Insights from a Multi-Experiment Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22402v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a grammar error correction (GEC) system that achieves state of the art for the Czech language. Our system is based on a neural network translation approach with the Transformer architecture, and its key feature is its real-time synthetic generation pipeline, which dynamically augments sentences with artificial errors by introducing both language-agnostic and Czech-specific errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size, and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model links are available on https://github.com/ufal/tsd2025-gec.</p></details> | Accepted to TSD 2025 |
| **[Bridging the Gap Between Saliency Prediction and Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04997v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, deep neural models have made considerable advances in image quality assessment (IQA). However, the underlying reasons for their success remain unclear, owing to the complex nature of deep neural networks. IQA aims to describe how the human visual system (HVS) works and to create its efficient approximations. On the other hand, Saliency Prediction task aims to emulate HVS via determining areas of visual interest. Thus, we believe that saliency plays a crucial role in human perception. In this work, we conduct an empirical study that reveals the relation between IQA and Saliency Prediction tasks, demonstrating that the former incorporates knowledge of the latter. Moreover, we introduce a novel SACID dataset of saliency-aware compressed images and conduct a large-scale comparison of classic and neural-based IQA methods. All supplementary code and data will be available at the time of publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Distributed Neural Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22389v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts, Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.</p></details> | 36 pages, 25 figures |
| **[From Ground to Air: Noise Robustness in Vision Transformers and CNNs for Event-Based Vehicle Classification with Potential UAV Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22360v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes, unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 17 figures, 9 tables.

The retrieval system was a ColBERT bi-encoder architecture, which represents a passage with many dense tokens. Retrieval used a local, compressed index of the FineWeb10-BT collection created with PLAID-X, using a model fine-tuned for multilingual retrieval. Query generation from context was done with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, while filtering was accomplished with m2-bert-80M-8k-retrieval. Up to nine passages were used as context to generate an answer using Falcon3-10B. This system placed 5th in the LiveRAG automatic evaluation for correctness with a score of 1.07.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Closing the Performance Gap in Biometric Cryptosystems: A Deeper Analysis on Unlinkable Fuzzy Vaults](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22347v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations. To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Toward Data Systems That Are Business Semantic Centric and AI Agents Assisted](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05520v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary businesses operate in dynamic environments requiring rapid adaptation to achieve goals and maintain competitiveness. Existing data platforms often fall short by emphasizing tools over alignment with business needs, resulting in inefficiencies and delays. To address this gap, I propose the Business Semantics Centric, AI Agents Assisted Data System (BSDS), a holistic system that integrates architecture, workflows, and team organization to ensure data systems are tailored to business priorities rather than dictated by technical constraints. BSDS redefines data systems as dynamic enablers of business success, transforming them from passive tools into active drivers of organizational growth. BSDS has a modular architecture that comprises curated data linked to business entities, a knowledge base for context-aware AI agents, and efficient data pipelines. AI agents play a pivotal role in assisting with data access and system management, reducing human effort, and improving scalability. Complementing this architecture, BSDS incorporates workflows optimized for both exploratory data analysis and production requirements, balancing speed of delivery with quality assurance. A key innovation of BSDS is its incorporation of the human factor. By aligning data team expertise with business semantics, BSDS bridges the gap between technical capabilities and business needs. Validated through real-world implementation, BSDS accelerates time-to-market for data-driven initiatives, enhances cross-functional collaboration, and provides a scalable blueprint for businesses of all sizes. Future research can build on BSDS to explore optimization strategies using complex systems and adaptive network theories, as well as developing autonomous data systems leveraging AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[NSegment : Label-specific Deformations for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19634v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeling errors in remote sensing (RS) image segmentation datasets often remain implicit and subtle due to ambiguous class boundaries, mixed pixels, shadows, complex terrain features, and subjective annotator bias. Furthermore, the scarcity of annotated RS data due to high image acquisition and labeling costs complicates training noise-robust models. While sophisticated mechanisms such as label selection or noise correction might address this issue, they tend to increase training time and add implementation complexity. In this letter, we propose NSegment-a simple yet effective data augmentation solution to mitigate this issue. Unlike traditional methods, it applies elastic transformations only to segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per sample in each training epoch to address annotation inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of RS image segmentation on various state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Design Space for Visualization Transitions of 3D Spatial Data in Hybrid AR-Desktop Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22250v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a design space for animated transitions of the appearance of 3D spatial datasets in a hybrid Augmented Reality (AR)-desktop context. Such hybrid interfaces combine both traditional and immersive displays to facilitate the exploration of 2D and 3D data representations in the environment in which they are best displayed. One key aspect is to introduce transitional animations that change between the different dimensionalities to illustrate the connection between the different representations and to reduce the potential cognitive load on the user. The specific transitions to be used depend on the type of data, the needs of the application domain, and other factors. We summarize these as a transition design space to simplify the decision-making process and provide inspiration for future designs. First, we discuss 3D visualizations from a spatial perspective: a spatial encoding pipeline, where 3D data sampled from the physical world goes through various transformations, being mapped to visual representations, and then being integrated into a hybrid AR-desktop environment. The transition design then focuses on interpolating between two spatial encoding pipelines to provide a smooth experience. To illustrate the use of our design space, we apply it to three case studies that focus on applications in astronomy, radiology, and chemistry; we then discuss lessons learned from these applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Quantum-Enhanced Attention Mechanism in NLP: A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15630v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in quantum computing have opened new pathways for enhancing deep learning architectures, particularly in domains characterized by high-dimensional and context-rich data such as natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we present a hybrid classical-quantum Transformer model that integrates a quantum-enhanced attention mechanism into the standard classical architecture. By embedding token representations into a quantum Hilbert space via parameterized variational circuits and exploiting entanglement-aware kernel similarities, the model captures complex semantic relationships beyond the reach of conventional dot-product attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across diverse NLP benchmarks, showing improvements in both efficiency and representational capacity. The results section reveal that the quantum attention layer yields globally coherent attention maps and more separable latent features, while requiring comparatively fewer parameters than classical counterparts. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-classical hybrid models to serve as a powerful and resource-efficient alternative to existing attention mechanisms in NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[AB-UPT: Scaling Neural CFD Surrogates for High-Fidelity Automotive Aerodynamics Simulations via Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09692v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural surrogate modeling offer the potential for transformative innovations in applications such as automotive aerodynamics. Yet, industrial-scale problems often involve volumetric meshes with cell counts reaching 100 million, presenting major scalability challenges. Complex geometries further complicate modeling through intricate surface-volume interactions, while quantities such as vorticity are highly nonlinear and must satisfy strict divergence-free constraints. To address these requirements, we introduce Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) as a novel modeling scheme for building neural surrogates for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. AB-UPT is designed to: (i) decouple geometry encoding and prediction tasks via multi-branch operators; (ii) enable scalability to high-resolution outputs via neural simulation in a low-dimensional latent space, coupled with anchored neural field decoders to predict high-fidelity outputs; (iii) enforce physics consistency by a novel divergence-free formulation. We show that AB-UPT yields state-of-the-art predictive accuracy of surface and volume fields on automotive CFD simulations ranging from 33 thousand up to 150 million mesh cells. Furthermore, our anchored neural field architecture enables the enforcement of hard physical constraints on the physics predictions without degradation in performance, exemplified by modeling divergence-free vorticity fields. Notably, the proposed models can be trained on a single GPU in less than a day and predict industry-standard surface and volume fields within seconds. Additionally, we show that the flexible design of our method enables neural simulation from a computer-aided design geometry alone, omitting the need for costly CFD meshing procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[dreaMLearning: Data Compression Assisted Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22190v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage, which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types, tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning, and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities for efficient and scalable learning.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |
| **[RM-Dijkstra: A surface optimal path planning algorithm based on Riemannian metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22170v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Dijkstra algorithm is a classic path planning method, which operates in a discrete graph space to determine the shortest path from a specified source point to a target node or all other nodes based on non-negative edge weights. Numerous studies have focused on the Dijkstra algorithm due to its potential application. However, its application in surface path planning for mobile robots remains largely unexplored. In this letter, a surface optimal path planning algorithm called RM-Dijkstra is proposed, which is based on Riemannian metric model. By constructing a new Riemannian metric on the 2D projection plane, the surface optimal path planning problem is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the 2D plane with new Riemannian metric. Induced by the standard Euclidean metric on surface, the constructed new metric reflects environmental information of the robot and ensures that the projection map is an isometric immersion. By conducting a series of simulation tests, the experimental results demonstrate that the RM-Dijkstra algorithm not only effectively solves the optimal path planning problem on surfaces, but also outperforms traditional path planning algorithms in terms of path accuracy and smoothness, particularly in complex scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Closing the Loop: How Semantic Closure Enables Open-Ended Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374v6)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript explores the evolutionary emergence of semantic closure -- the self-referential mechanism through which symbols actively construct and interpret their own functional contexts -- by integrating concepts from relational biology, physical biosemiotics, and ecological psychology into a unified computational enactivism framework. By extending Hofmeyr's (F, A)-systems -- a continuation of Rosen's (M, R)-systems -- with temporal parametrization and multiscale causality, we develop a model capable of capturing critical life properties, including autopoiesis, anticipation, and adaptation. We then establish a formal equivalence between our extended (F, A)-systems and swarms of communicating automata, resolving self-referential challenges concerning the realizability of relational models. Our stepwise model traces the evolution of semantic closure from simple reaction networks that recognize regular languages to self-replicating chemical systems with memory and anticipatory capabilities, identifying self-reference as necessary for robust self-replication and open-ended evolution. Such a computational enactivist perspective underscores the essential necessity of implementing symbol-matter transformations into computing architectures, providing a cohesive theoretical basis for a recently proposed trialectic between autopoiesis, anticipation, and adaptation to solve the problem of relevance realization. Thus, our work opens pathways to new models of computation for life, agency and cognition, offering fundamental principles underlying biological information processing.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 tables |

Traditional solutions often seek to erase these asymmetries, but recent research suggests embracing them as productive design constraints. In this context, we introduce NoticeLight: a tangible, peripheral robotic embodiment designed to augment hybrid meetings. NoticeLight transforms remote participants' digital presence into ambient, physical signals -- such as mood dynamics, verbal contribution mosaics, and attention cues -- within the co-located space. By abstracting group states into subtle light patterns, NoticeLight fosters peripheral awareness and balanced participation without disrupting meeting flow or demanding cognitive overload. This approach aligns with emerging perspectives in human-robot synergy, positioning robots as mediators that reshape, rather than replicate, human presence. Our work thereby advances the discourse on how robotic embodiments can empower equitable, dynamic collaboration in the workplace.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on The Future of Human-Robot Synergy in Interactive Environments: The Role of Robots at the Workplace at CHIWORK 2025, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p></details> |

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed AM, enabling advanced in-context learning, prompt-based generation, and robust cross-domain adaptability. This survey systematically synthesizes recent advancements in LLM-driven AM. We provide a concise review of foundational theories and annotation frameworks, alongside a meticulously curated catalog of datasets. A key contribution is our comprehensive taxonomy of AM subtasks, elucidating how contemporary LLM techniques -- such as prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and retrieval augmentation -- have reconfigured their execution. We further detail current LLM architectures and methodologies, critically assess evaluation practices, and delineate pivotal challenges including long-context reasoning, interpretability, and annotation bottlenecks. Conclusively, we highlight emerging trends and propose a forward-looking research agenda for LLM-based computational argumentation, aiming to strategically guide researchers in this rapidly evolving domain.</p></details> | Work draft |

We show how Transformers can be viewed as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing networks that learn relationships among input elements without being constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs, Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing.

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Query as Test: An Intelligent Driving Test and Data Storage Method for Integrated Cockpit-Vehicle-Road Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22068v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Vehicular Technology</p></details> |

While recent diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

NLDR often exaggerates random patterns. But NLDR views have an important role in data analysis because, if done well, they provide a concise visual (and conceptual) summary of \pD{} distributions. The NLDR methods and hyper-parameter choices can create wildly different representations, making it difficult to decide which is best, or whether any or all are accurate or misleading. To help assess the NLDR and decide on which, if any, is the most reasonable representation of the structure(s) present in the \pD{} data, we have developed an algorithm to show the \gD{} NLDR model in the \pD{} space, viewed with a tour, a movie of linear projections. From this, one can see if the model fits everywhere, or better in some subspaces, or completely mismatches the data. Also, we can see how different methods may have similar summaries or quirks.</p></details> | 40 pages |

Recently, various LLM-based agents have been developed to assist scientific discovery progress across multiple aspects and domains. Among these, computer-using agents, capable of interacting with operating systems as humans do, are paving the way to automated scientific problem-solving and addressing routines in researchers' workflows. Recognizing the transformative potential of these agents, we introduce ScienceBoard, which encompasses two complementary contributions: (i) a realistic, multi-domain environment featuring dynamic and visually rich scientific workflows with integrated professional software, where agents can autonomously interact via different interfaces to accelerate complex research tasks and experiments; and (ii) a challenging benchmark of 169 high-quality, rigorously validated real-world tasks curated by humans, spanning scientific-discovery workflows in domains such as biochemistry, astronomy, and geoinformatics. Extensive evaluations of agents with state-of-the-art backbones (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3.7, UI-TARS) show that, despite some promising results, they still fall short of reliably assisting scientists in complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate. In-depth analysis further provides valuable insights for addressing current agent limitations and more effective design principles, paving the way to build more capable agents for scientific discovery.

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.</p></details> | 41 pages |

Continuous maritime ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations, we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS, which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs, ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our dataset and baseline method are publicly available on https://github.com/Alioth2000/Hoss-ReID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zero-...</summary><p>Zero-shot video editing</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate the secrecy performance of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted secure integrated communication, sensing, and computing system, where the UAV sends radar signals to locate and disrupt potential eavesdroppers while providing offload services to ground users (GUs). Considering the constraints of UAV maximum speed, transmit power, and propulsion energy, as well as secure offloading, data transmission, and computation time, the total energy consumption of GUs is minimized by jointly optimizing user offloading ratio, user scheduling strategy, transmit beamforming, and UAV trajectory. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem caused by tightly coupled dependent variables. In particular, the original optimization problem is decomposed into four sub-optimization problems, and the non-convex sub-problems are transformed into approximately convex forms via successive convex approximation. Then, all sub-problems are solved successively by using the block coordinate descent technique. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal for review</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose a novel neural network, termed WTFormer, for MIMO speech enhancement that leverages the multi-resolution characteristics of wavelet transform and multi-dimensional collaborative attention to effectively capture globally distributed spatial features, while using Conformer for time-frequency modeling. A multi task loss strategy accompanying MUSIC algorithm is further proposed for optimization training to protect spatial information to the greatest extent. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset show that WTFormer can achieve comparable denoising performance to advanced systems while preserving more spatial information with only 0.98M parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech2025</p></details> |

The pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85 minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance, utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the proposed normalization scheme).</p></details> | <details><summary>Compu...</summary><p>Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025 Workshops</p></details> |

Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model. We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length.

To address these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and improves the semantic understanding accuracy.

Modern applications often demand flexibility beyond classical parametric models, motivating non-parametric descriptions of the ACF. Bochner's Theorem guarantees that any positive spectral measure yields a valid ACF via the inverse Fourier transform; however, existing non-parametric approaches in the spectral domain rarely return closed-form expressions for the ACF itself. We develop a flexible, closed-form class of non-parametric ACFs by deriving the inverse Fourier transform of B-spline spectral bases with arbitrary degree and knot placement. This yields a general class of ACF with three key features: (i) it is provably dense, under an $L^1$ metric, in the space of weakly stationary, mean-square continuous ACFs with mild regularity conditions; (ii) it accommodates univariate, multivariate, and multidimensional processes; and (iii) it naturally supports non-separable structure without requiring explicit imposition. Jackson-type approximation bounds establish convergence rates, and empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate accurate process recovery. The method provides a practical and theoretically grounded approach for constructing a non-parametric class of ACF.</p></details> | Submitted to JRSSB |

However, their real-time feasibility is hindered by slow training and inference speeds. This study addresses this challenge by proposing a wavelet-based conditional Diffusion GAN scheme for Single-Image Super-Resolution (SISR). Our approach utilizes the diffusion GAN paradigm to reduce the timesteps required by the reverse diffusion process and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to achieve dimensionality reduction, decreasing training and inference times significantly. The results of an experimental validation on the CelebA-HQ dataset confirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

Recent research has focused on enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation, searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension, retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs, tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy. Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos.

While prior approaches have primarily addressed these issues independently, their simultaneous occurrence is common in medical imaging. A method that generalizes to unseen domains using only minimal annotations offers significant practical value due to reduced data annotation and development costs. In pursuit of this goal, we propose FSDA-DG, a novel solution to improve cross-domain generalizability of medical image segmentation with few single-source domain annotations. Specifically, our approach introduces semantics-guided semi-supervised data augmentation. This method divides images into global broad regions and semantics-guided local regions, and applies distinct augmentation strategies to enrich data distribution. Within this framework, both labeled and unlabeled data are transformed into extensive domain knowledge while preserving domain-invariant semantic information. Additionally, FSDA-DG employs a multi-decoder U-Net pipeline semi-supervised learning (SSL) network to improve domain-invariant representation learning through consistent prior assumption across multiple perturbations. By integrating data-level and model-level designs, FSDA-DG achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in two challenging single domain generalization (SDG) tasks with limited annotations.

Most existing models are primarily based on either convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages. Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention, which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.

Previous methods mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy. Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC) approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set, ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention ratios.

In CFL, clients are naturally grouped into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings, and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and unsupervised PFL tasks.</p></details> | 31 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Metadata Conditioning Accelerates Language Model Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01956v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vast diversity of styles, domains, and quality levels present in language model pre-training corpora is essential in developing general model capabilities, but efficiently learning and deploying the correct behaviors exemplified in each of these heterogeneous data sources is challenging. To address this, we propose a new method, termed Metadata Conditioning then Cooldown (MeCo), to incorporate additional learning cues during pre-training. MeCo first provides metadata (e.g., URLs like www$.$wikipedia$.$org) alongside the text during training and later uses a cooldown phase with only the standard text, thereby enabling the model to function normally even without metadata. MeCo significantly accelerates pre-training across different model scales (600M to 8B parameters) and training sources (C4, RefinedWeb, and DCLM). For instance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task performance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data. Additionally, MeCo enables us to steer language models by conditioning the inference prompt on either real or fabricated metadata that encodes the desired properties of the output: for example, prepending wikipedia$.$org to reduce harmful generations or factquizmaster$.$com (fabricated) to improve common knowledge task performance. We also demonstrate that MeCo is compatible with different types of metadata, such as model-generated topics.

While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits, and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular, token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four synergistic mechanisms: (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length. Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach, designated as Hypergraph Structure Learning with Smoothness (HSLS), addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication; Section I includes more applications, comparisons, and enumerated list of novel contributions; removed numerical analysis of TV terms in Section II, added more general discussion; updated Algorithm 1 and corresponding text; third experiment of Section V-C replaced with new experiment</p></details> |

Such ODE models characterize drug plasma concentration over time and allow pharmacokinetic parameters to be inferred, such as drug absorption and elimination rates. For time-course studies involving treatment groups with multiple subjects, mixed-effects ODE models are commonly used. However, existing methods tend to lack uncertainty quantification on a subject-level, for key measures such as peak or trough concentration and for making predictions of drug concentration. To address such limitations, we propose an extension of manifold-constrained Gaussian processes for inference of general mixed-effects ODE models within a Bayesian statistical framework. We evaluate our method on simulated examples, demonstrating its ability to provide fast and accurate inference for parameters and trajectories using nested optimization. To illustrate the practical efficacy of the proposed method, we provide a real data analysis of a pharmacokinetic model used for an HIV combination therapy study.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Towards Operational Data Analytics Chatbots -- Virtual Knowledge Graph is All You Need](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22267v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With generative artificial intelligence challenging computational scientific computing, data centers are experiencing unprecedented growth in both scale and volume. As a result, computing efficiency has become more critical than ever. Operational Data Analytics (ODA) relies on the collection of data center telemetry to improve efficiency, but so far has been focusing on real-time telemetry data visualization and post-mortem analysis. However, with NoSQL databases now serving as the default storage backend to support scalability, querying this data is challenging due to its schema-less nature, which requires domain knowledge to traverse relationships between data sources. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can capture these relationships, but traditional KGs are costly to scale and have not been widely applied to multivariate timeseries. Virtual Knowledge Graphs (VKGs) offer a lightweight alternative by generating query-specific graphs at runtime. In this work, we present a full end-to-end ODA chatbot system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate SPARQL queries, utilizing VKG for data retrieval. This approach achieves 92.5% accuracy compared to 25% with direct NoSQL queries. The proposed methodology optimizes VKG construction and LLM inference, cutting previous work average query latency by 85% (from 20.36s to 3.03s) and keeping VKG sizes under 179 MiB. This performance makes the tool suitable for deployment and real-time interaction with ODA end-users.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Listwise rerankers, which improve relevance by jointly considering multiple candidates, are often limited in practice: either by model input size constraints, or by degraded quality when processing large sets. We propose a model-agnostic method for fast reranking large sets that exceed a model input limits. The method first partitions candidate items into overlapping blocks, each of which is ranked independently in parallel. Implicit pairwise comparisons are then derived from these local rankings. Finally, these comparisons are aggregated to construct a global ranking using algorithms such as Winrate or PageRank. Experiments on TREC DL-2019 show that our method achieves an nDCG@10 of 70.88 compared to the 57.68 for full-context listwise approach using gpt-4.1-mini as long-context model, while reducing latency from 21 to 8 seconds.

To address these issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively. In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICME2025</p></details> |

Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04412v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |

Constructing parametric distributions on this space is challenging due to its non-Euclidean geometry and the intractability of normalizing constants. We address this by fitting Brownian motion transition kernels to tree-valued data via a non-Euclidean bridge construction. Each kernel is determined by a source tree $x_0$ (the Brownian motion's starting point) and a dispersion parameter $t_0$ (its duration). Observed trees are modelled as independent draws from the transition kernel defined by $(x_0, t_0)$, analogous to a Gaussian model in Euclidean space. Brownian motion is approximated by an $m$-step random walk, with the parameter space augmented to include full sample paths. We develop a bridge algorithm to sample paths conditional on their endpoints, and introduce methods for sampling a Bayesian posterior for $(x_0, t_0)$ and for marginal likelihood evaluation. This enables hypothesis testing for alternative source trees. The approach is validated on simulated data and applied to an experimental data set of yeast gene trees. These methods provide a foundation for future development of a wider class of probabilistic models of tree-valued data.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages plus appendix of 22 pages. 22 figures</p></details> |

The number of bits dedicated to each weight from the original model is reduced based on how important they are thought to be during model inference. This importance is arrived at through the application of an 'importance matrix'-a relatively small text document meant to be representative of the LLM's standard use-cases. In the vast majority of quants available online, this document is primarily written in English. It was therefore an open question whether performance on English language tasks was preserved through the sacrifice of multilingual performance and whether it can be preserved with alternate importance matrices. This article investigates these hypotheses by quantizing Llama3.3 70B on importance matrices written in three languages (English, Norwegian, and Malayalam) and evaluating them on the MixEval dataset in both English and Norwegian. All experiments related to yielded non-significant results indicating that current quantization practices do not disproportionately harm multilingual performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, v2</p></details> |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

| **[Lost at the Beginning of Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22058v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments, the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While multimodal MRI offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions, existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of joint modeling for integrated predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd S...</summary><p>2nd Sorbonne-Heidelberg Workshop on AI in medicine: Machine Learning for multi-modal data</p></details> |

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.</p></details> | 41 pages |

However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, directly applying existing video editing methods to Video DiTs often incurs substantial computational overhead, due to resource-intensive attention modification or finetuning. To alleviate this problem, we present DFVEdit, an efficient zero-shot video editing method tailored for Video DiTs. DFVEdit eliminates the need for both attention modification and fine-tuning by directly operating on clean latents via flow transformation. To be more specific, we observe that editing and sampling can be unified under the continuous flow perspective. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Conditional Delta Flow Vector (CDFV) -- a theoretically unbiased estimation of DFV -- and integrate Implicit Cross Attention (ICA) guidance as well as Embedding Reinforcement (ER) to further enhance editing quality. DFVEdit excels in practical efficiency, offering at least 20x inference speed-up and 85% memory reduction on Video DiTs compared to attention-engineering-based editing methods. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DFVEdit can be seamlessly applied to popular Video DiTs (e.g., CogVideoX and Wan2.1), attaining state-of-the-art performance on structural fidelity, spatial-temporal consistency, and editing quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Zero-...</summary><p>Zero-shot video editing</p></details> |

Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with two variants that fine-tunes a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's knowledge boundary based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at https://github.com/Chord-Chen-30/VLLM-KnowledgeBoundary</p></details> | ACL25 May ARR |

Diffusion-based image editing approaches capitalized on the deep understanding of diffusion models of image semantics to perform a variety of edits. However, existing diffusion models lack sufficient understanding of many object parts, hindering fine-grained edits requested by users. To address this, we propose to expand the knowledge of pre-trained diffusion models to allow them to understand various object parts, enabling them to perform fine-grained edits. We achieve this by learning special textual tokens that correspond to different object parts through an efficient token optimization process. These tokens are optimized to produce reliable localization masks at each inference step to localize the editing region. Leveraging these masks, we design feature-blending and adaptive thresholding strategies to execute the edits seamlessly. To evaluate our approach, we establish a benchmark and an evaluation protocol for part editing. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing editing methods on all metrics and is preferred by users 66-90% of the time in conducted user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025 (Conference Track).

Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model.

Current research largely emphasizes post-hoc correction or model-specific fine-tuning strategies, with limited exploration of preprocessing techniques to address hallucination issues at the input stage. This study presents a novel ensemble-based preprocessing framework that adaptively selects the most appropriate filtering approach -- noise reduced (NR), edge enhanced (EE), or unaltered input (org) based on the type of question posed, resulting into reduced hallucination without requiring any modifications to the underlying model architecture or training pipeline. Evaluated on the `HaloQuest' dataset -- a benchmark designed to test multimodal reasoning on visually complex inputs, our method achieves a 44.3% reduction in hallucination rates, as measured by Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores using SelfCheckGPT. This demonstrates that intelligent input conditioning alone can significantly enhance factual grounding in LLM responses. The findings highlight the importance of adaptive preprocessing techniques in mitigating hallucinations, paving the way for more reliable multimodal systems capable of addressing real-world challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in NCAA Springer, 21 pages, 4 figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

While many of these techniques are discussed across the literature, they have not been analyzed under the framework of a complete inference system, nor have the systems themselves been analyzed and compared. In this survey, we review these techniques, starting from operators and algorithms for request processing, then moving on to techniques for model optimization and execution, including kernel design, batching, and scheduling, before ending with techniques for memory management, including paged memory, eviction and offloading techniques, quantization, and cache persistence. Through these discussions, we show that these techniques fundamentally rely on load prediction, adaptive mechanisms, and cost reduction in order to overcome the challenges introduced by autoregressive generation and achieve the goals of the system. We then discuss how these techniques can be combined to form single-replica and multi-replica inference systems, including disaggregated inference systems that offer more control over resource allocation and serverless systems that can be deployed over shared hardware infrastructure. We end with a discussion of remaining challenges.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[A Dual-Layered Evaluation of Geopolitical and Cultural Bias in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21881v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment, while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ACL Student Research Workshop (SRW) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Do Vision-Language Models Have Internal World Models? Towards an Atomic Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21876v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning. Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial, temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation, transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660 experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding -- e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones. More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and human-level world modeling.</p></details> | ACL 2025 (Findings) |
| **[DidSee: Diffusion-Based Depth Completion for Material-Agnostic Robotic Perception and Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21034v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commercial RGB-D cameras often produce noisy, incomplete depth maps for non-Lambertian objects. Traditional depth completion methods struggle to generalize due to the limited diversity and scale of training data. Recent advances exploit visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, we find that biases arising from training-inference mismatches in the vanilla diffusion framework significantly impair depth completion performance. Additionally, the lack of distinct visual features in non-Lambertian regions further hinders precise prediction. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{DidSee}, a diffusion-based framework for depth completion on non-Lambertian objects. First, we integrate a rescaled noise scheduler enforcing a zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio to eliminate signal leakage bias. Second, we devise a noise-agnostic single-step training formulation to alleviate error accumulation caused by exposure bias and optimize the model with a task-specific loss. Finally, we incorporate a semantic enhancer that enables joint depth completion and semantic segmentation, distinguishing objects from backgrounds and yielding precise, fine-grained depth maps. DidSee achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrates robust real-world generalization, and effectively improves downstream tasks such as category-level pose estimation and robotic grasping.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wenzhoulyu.github.io/DidSee/</p></details> |

| **[CoMPaSS: Enhancing Spatial Understanding in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13195v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating photorealistic images but often fail to render accurate spatial relationships. We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of data concerning spatial relationships in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We propose CoMPaSS, a versatile framework that enhances spatial understanding in T2I models. It first addresses data ambiguity with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data via principled constraints. To leverage these priors, CoMPaSS also introduces the Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module, which preserves crucial token ordering information lost by text encoders, thereby reinforcing the prompt's linguistic structure. Extensive experiments on four popular T2I models (UNet and MMDiT-based) show CoMPaSS sets a new state of the art on key spatial benchmarks, with substantial relative gains on VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

| **[ObjFiller-3D: Consistent Multi-view 3D Inpainting via Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18271v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition, we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of 0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications.

| **[SafeBimanual: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Safe Bimanual Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18268v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM) to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by 32.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is at: https://denghaoyuan123.github.io/SafeBimanip/</p></details> |
| **[MMTok: Multimodal Coverage Maximization for Efficient Inference of VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18264v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore, with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of coverage in token selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://project.ironieser.cc/mmtok</p></details> |
| **[MIRAGE: Scaling Test-Time Inference with Parallel Graph-Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18260v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown significant progress in test-time scaling through chain-of-thought prompting. Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures (including tables), plus appendix. Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Sycophancy of Language Models in Multi-turn Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23840v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness, overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views. Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at https://github.com/JiseungHong/SYCON-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: Improved Collision Models and Further Results](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953v5)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics (Volume 20, Issue 6, June 2025), the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted, demonstrating that the models can accurately capture the nature of a variety of collision phenomena. In this article, the aforementioned models are augmented by modeling the effects of external forces as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, see https://gitlab.com/user9716869/EBWCM ; (v2-v5) various minor amendments; (v5) replaced the parameter identification study of Quinn (2004) with Villegas et al (2021) due to incompatibility of the proposed collision models with the experimental setup in Quinn (2004); arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.08147</p></details> |
| **[Testing frequency distributions in a stream](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11175v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to verify specific frequency distributions when we observe a stream of $N$ data items taken from a universe of $n$ distinct items. We introduce the \emph{relative Fr\'echet distance} to compare two frequency functions in a homogeneous manner. We consider two streaming models: insertions only and sliding windows. We present a Tester for a certain class of functions, which decides if $f $ is close to $g$ or if $f$ is far from $g$ with high probability, when $f$ is given and $g$ is defined by a stream. If $f$ is uniform we show a space $\Omega(n)$ lower bound. If $f$ decreases fast enough, we then only use space $O(\log^2 n\cdot \log\log n)$. The analysis relies on the Spacesaving algorithm \cite{MAE2005,Z22} and on sampling the stream.</p></details> | 28 pages, 4 figures |
| **[ANO : Faster is Better in Noisy Landscape](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18258v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic optimizers are central to deep learning, yet widely used methods such as Adam and Adan can degrade in non-stationary or noisy environments, partly due to their reliance on momentum-based magnitude estimates. We introduce Ano, a novel optimizer that decouples direction and magnitude: momentum is used for directional smoothing, while instantaneous gradient magnitudes determine step size. This design improves robustness to gradient noise while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of first-order methods. We further propose Anolog, which removes sensitivity to the momentum coefficient by expanding its window over time via a logarithmic schedule. We establish non-convex convergence guarantees with a convergence rate similar to other sign-based methods, and empirically show that Ano provides substantial gains in noisy and non-stationary regimes such as reinforcement learning, while remaining competitive on low-noise tasks such as standard computer vision benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress, 26 pages total with appendix, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Logic Networks for Interpretable Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08172v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional neural networks have an impressive classification performance, but what they learn cannot be inspected, verified or extracted. Neural Logic Networks on the other hand have an interpretable structure that enables them to learn a logical mechanism relating the inputs and outputs with AND and OR operations. We generalize these networks with NOT operations and biases that take into account unobserved data and develop a rigorous logical and probabilistic modeling in terms of concept combinations to motivate their use. We also propose a novel factorized IF-THEN rule structure for the model as well as a modified learning algorithm. Our method improves the state-of-the-art in Boolean networks discovery and is able to learn relevant, interpretable rules in tabular classification, notably on examples from the medical and industrial fields where interpretability has tangible value.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures, pre-print, code available at https://github.com/VincentPerreault0/NeuralLogicNetworks</p></details> |
| **[Demographic Biases and Gaps in the Perception of Sexism in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18245v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has proven to be a tool that could help in the automatic detection of sexism. Previous studies have shown that these models contain biases that do not accurately reflect reality, especially for minority groups. Despite various efforts to improve the detection of sexist content, this task remains a significant challenge due to its subjective nature and the biases present in automated models. We explore the capabilities of different LLMs to detect sexism in social media text using the EXIST 2024 tweet dataset. It includes annotations from six distinct profiles for each tweet, allowing us to evaluate to what extent LLMs can mimic these groups' perceptions in sexism detection. Additionally, we analyze the demographic biases present in the models and conduct a statistical analysis to identify which demographic characteristics (age, gender) contribute most effectively to this task. Our results show that, while LLMs can to some extent detect sexism when considering the overall opinion of populations, they do not accurately replicate the diversity of perceptions among different demographic groups. This highlights the need for better-calibrated models that account for the diversity of perspectives across different populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was presented as a poster at the Latin American Meeting in Artificial Intelligence KHIPU 2025, Santiago, Chile, March 10th - 14th 2025, https://khipu.ai/khipu2025/poster-sessions-2025/</p></details> |
| **[GSVisLoc: Generalizable Visual Localization for Gaussian Splatting Scene Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18242v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing 3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel scenes without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshops (CALIPOSE).

We present LCI, a communication library designed for efficient asynchronous multithreaded communication. LCI provides a concise interface that supports common point-to-point primitives and diverse completion mechanisms, along with flexible controls for incrementally fine-tuning communication resources and runtime behavior. It features a threading-efficient runtime built on atomic data structures, fine-grained non-blocking locks, and low-level network insights. We evaluate LCI on both Infiniband and Slingshot-11 clusters with microbenchmarks and two application-level benchmarks. Experimental results show that LCI significantly outperforms existing communication libraries in various multithreaded scenarios, achieving performance that exceeds the traditional multi-process execution mode and unlocking new possibilities for emerging programming models and applications. LCI is open-source and available at https://github.com/uiuc-hpc/lci.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures.

| **[AffordanceSAM: Segment Anything Once More in Affordance Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15650v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a generalized affordance grounding model to identify actionable regions on objects is vital for real-world applications. Existing methods to train the model can be divided into weakly and fully supervised ways. However, the former method requires a complex training framework design and can not infer new actions without an auxiliary prior. While the latter often struggle with limited annotated data and components trained from scratch despite being simpler. This study focuses on fully supervised affordance grounding and overcomes its limitations by proposing AffordanceSAM, which extends SAM's generalization capacity in segmentation to affordance grounding. Specifically, we design an affordance-adaption module and curate a coarse-to-fine annotated dataset called C2F-Aff to thoroughly transfer SAM's robust performance to affordance in a three-stage training manner. Experimental results confirm that AffordanceSAM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the AGD20K benchmark and exhibits strong generalized capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>SAM M...</summary><p>SAM Meets Affordance Grounding</p></details> |

The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (6 pages + references + appendices)</p></details> |
| **[Follow My Hold: Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction through Geometric Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18213v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues, including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aidilayce.github.io/FollowMyHold-page/</p></details> |
| **[OwkinZero: Accelerating Biological Discovery with AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16315v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing scientific research, they continue to struggle with core biological reasoning tasks essential for translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000 verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological discovery.</p></details> | Preprint |

One approach involves learning unmodelled (residual) dynamics, in addition to nominal models derived from first principles. Varying residual models across an environment manifest as modes of a piecewise residual (PWR) model that requires a) identifying how modes are distributed across the environment and b) solving a computationally intensive Mixed Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) problem for control. We develop an iterative mapping algorithm capable of predicting time-varying mode distributions. We then develop and solve two tractable approximations of the MINLP to combine with the predictor in closed-loop to solve the overall control problem. In simulation, we first demonstrate how the approximations improve performance by 4-18% in comparison to the MINLP while achieving significantly lower computation times (upto 250x faster). We then demonstrate how the proposed mapping algorithm incrementally improves controller performance (upto 3x) over multiple iterations of a trajectory tracking control task even when the mode distributions change over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Control Conference (ECC) 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce TranSQL+, a template-based code generator that translates LLM computation graphs into pure SQL queries for execution in relational databases. Without relying on external libraries, TranSQL+, leverages mature database features, such as vectorized execution and out-of-core processing, for efficient inference. We further propose a row-to-column (ROW2COL) optimization that improves join efficiency in matrix operations. Evaluated on Llama3-8B and DeepSeekMoE models, TranSQL+ achieves up to 20x lower prefill latency and 4x higher decoding speed compared to DeepSpeed Inference and Llama.cpp in low-memory and CPU-only configurations.

| **[ST-Raptor: LLM-Powered Semi-Structured Table Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18190v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy.

| **[HeteroTune: Efficient Federated Learning for Large Heterogeneous Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16796v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large pre-trained models have achieved impressive performance across AI tasks, their deployment in privacy-sensitive and distributed environments remains challenging. Federated learning (FL) offers a viable solution by enabling decentralized fine-tuning without data sharing, but real-world applications face significant obstacles due to heterogeneous client resources in compute and memory. To address this, we propose HeteroTune, a novel federated fine-tuning paradigm for large, heterogeneous models operating under limited communication and computation budgets. The core of our method lies in a novel architecture, DeMA (Dense Mixture of Adapters), which enables flexible and efficient aggregation of heterogeneous models by preserving their full representational capacity while facilitating seamless cross-model knowledge fusion. We further introduce CMGA (Cross-Model Gradient Alignment), a lightweight yet effective mechanism that enhances training stability by harmonizing gradient directions across heterogeneous client models during aggregation, mitigating update conflicts and promoting more consistent convergence in federated settings. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence showing that HeteroTune achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across diverse tasks and model architectures. For example, on LLaMA models, it reduces communication overhead by 99.5%, cuts peak memory usage by ~50%, and improves performance by 4.61%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce SEAM, a benchmark that pairs semantically equivalent inputs across four domains that have existing standardized textual and visual notations. By employing distinct notation systems across modalities, in contrast to OCR-based image-text pairing, SEAM provides a rigorous comparative assessment of the textual-symbolic and visual-spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Across 21 contemporary models, we observe systematic modality imbalance: vision frequently lags language in overall performance, despite the problems containing semantically equivalent information, and cross-modal agreement is relatively low. Our error analysis reveals two main drivers: textual perception failures from tokenization in domain notation and visual perception failures that induce hallucinations. We also show that our results are largely robust to visual transformations. SEAM establishes a controlled, semantically equivalent setting for measuring and improving modality-agnostic reasoning.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

The modular framework was developed implementing differentiated processing strategies, effectively reducing memory requirements from 38GB to 16GB while maintaining model performance. The multi-agent architecture combines scene classification, vectorized memory, and multimodal interaction, enabling persistent storage and efficient retrieval of scene memories. Through perception-memory-reasoning workflows, the system provides environmental information beyond the current view using historical memories. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The system maintains response latency between 2.83-3.52 seconds from scene analysis to initial speech output, substantially faster than non-streaming methods. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering visually impaired users comprehensive real-time assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.</p></details> | 28 pages,9 figures |

Organizing related insights into visual data stories is crucial for in-depth analysis. However, constructing such stories is challenging because of the complexity of the inherent relations between extracted insights. Users face difficulty sifting through a vast number of discrete insights to integrate specific ones into a unified narrative that meets their analytical goals. Existing methods either heavily rely on user expertise, making the process inefficient, or employ automated approaches that cannot fully capture their evolving goals. In this paper, we introduce InReAcTable, a framework that enhances visual data story construction by establishing both structural and semantic connections between data insights. Each user interaction triggers the Acting module, which utilizes an insight graph for structural filtering to narrow the search space, followed by the Reasoning module using the retrieval-augmented generation method based on large language models for semantic filtering, ultimately providing insight recommendations aligned with the user's analytical intent. Based on the InReAcTable framework, we develop an interactive prototype system that guides users to construct visual data stories aligned with their analytical requirements. We conducted a case study and a user experiment to demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the InReAcTable framework and the prototype system for interactively building visual data stories.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, accepted at ACM UIST 2025 (to appear)</p></details> |

This challenge is especially pronounced in discovering the governing equations of dynamical processes on networks or graphs, since even their topological structure further affects the processes' behavior. This paper provides a rigorous, comparative assessment of state-of-the-art symbolic regression techniques for this task. We evaluate established methods, including sparse regression and MLP-based architectures, and introduce a novel adaptation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for graphs, designed to exploit their inherent interpretability. Across a suite of synthetic and real-world dynamical systems, our results demonstrate that both MLP and KAN-based architectures can successfully identify the underlying symbolic equations, significantly surpassing existing baselines. Critically, we show that KANs achieve this performance with greater parsimony and transparency, as their learnable activation functions provide a clearer mapping to the true physical dynamics. This study offers a practical guide for researchers, clarifying the trade-offs between model expressivity and interpretability, and establishes the viability of neural-based architectures for robust scientific discovery on complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook Representations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for improved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings from app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns discrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel -- unlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables independent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better modeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative signals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item levels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a dual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to capture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a large-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong baselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further validates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement in CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment. The new framework has now been fully deployed on the Microsoft Store.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

We find that ssmSAT is undecidable in general, reflecting the computational power of SSM. Motivated by practical settings, we identify two natural restrictions under which ssmSAT becomes decidable and establish corresponding complexity bounds. First, for SSM with bounded context length, ssmSAT is NP-complete when the input length is given in unary and in NEXPTIME (and PSPACE-hard) when the input length is given in binary. Second, for quantised SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic, ssmSAT is PSPACE-complete resp. in EXPSPACE depending on the bit-width encoding. While these results hold for diagonal gated SSM we also establish complexity bounds for time-invariant SSM. Our results establish a first complexity landscape for formal reasoning in SSM and highlight fundamental limits and opportunities for the verification of SSM-based language models.</p></details> | Accepted at ECAI 25 |
| **[Hybrid Quantum-Classical Learning for Multiclass Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18161v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the challenge of improving multiclass image classification through quantum machine-learning techniques. It explores how the discarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical classifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit states after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain entangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is lost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the conventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully connected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately process measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are ensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a classical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to adapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing discarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid quantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

In this perspective article, we face the increasingly loud elephant in the room and ask a question that has been hinted at by many but not explicitly addressed: Can the structure that allows one to avoid barren plateaus also be leveraged to efficiently simulate the loss classically? We collect evidence-on a case-by-case basis-that many commonly used models whose loss landscapes avoid barren plateaus can also admit classical simulation, provided that one can collect some classical data from quantum devices during an initial data acquisition phase. This follows from the observation that barren plateaus result from a curse of dimensionality, and that current approaches for solving them end up encoding the problem into some small, classically simulable, subspaces. Thus, while stressing that quantum computers can be essential for collecting data, our analysis sheds doubt on the information processing capabilities of many parametrized quantum circuits with provably barren plateau-free landscapes. We end by discussing the (many) caveats in our arguments including the limitations of average case arguments, the role of smart initializations, models that fall outside our assumptions, the potential for provably superpolynomial advantages and the possibility that, once larger devices become available, parametrized quantum circuits could heuristically outperform our analytic expectations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15+22...</summary><p>15+22 pages, 5+2 figures, 2 tables, updated to published version</p></details> |

Our method conditions a latent diffusion model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues, including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aidilayce.github.io/FollowMyHold-page/</p></details> |

| **[HOSt3R: Keypoint-free Hand-Object 3D Reconstruction from RGB images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16465v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object 3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen object categories.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Deep Learning-based Cross-modal Reconstruction of Vehicle Target from Sparse 3D SAR Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04158v6)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional synthetic aperture radar (3D SAR) is an advanced active microwave imaging technology widely utilized in remote sensing area. To achieve high-resolution 3D imaging,3D SAR requires observations from multiple aspects and altitude baselines surrounding the target. However, constrained flight trajectories often lead to sparse observations, which degrade imaging quality, particularly for anisotropic man-made small targets, such as vehicles and aircraft. In the past, compressive sensing (CS) was the mainstream approach for sparse 3D SAR image reconstruction. More recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful alternative, markedly boosting reconstruction quality and efficiency. However, existing DL-based methods typically rely solely on high-quality 3D SAR images as supervisory signals to train deep neural networks (DNNs). This unimodal learning paradigm prevents the integration of complementary information from other data modalities, which limits reconstruction performance and reduces target discriminability due to the inherent constraints of electromagnetic scattering. In this paper, we introduce cross-modal learning and propose a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) for enhancing sparse 3D SAR images of vehicle targets by fusing optical information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error propagation guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs sparse 3D SAR images, which are derived from highly sparse-aspect observations, into visually structured 3D vehicle images. Trained exclusively on simulated data, CMAR-Net exhibits robust generalization to real-world data, outperforming state-of-the-art CS and DL methods in structural accuracy within a large-scale parking lot experiment involving numerous civilian vehicles, thereby demonstrating its strong practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Transferring Styles for Reduced Texture Bias and Improved Robustness in Semantic Segmentation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10239v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural networks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization capabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular DNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image classification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an effort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can likewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we perform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those random areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting style-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with the objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing their reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that in semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and strongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well as adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on PASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[ReHub: Linear Complexity Graph Transformers with Adaptive Hub-Spoke Reassignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01519v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present ReHub, a novel graph transformer architecture that achieves linear complexity through an efficient reassignment technique between nodes and virtual nodes. Graph transformers have become increasingly important in graph learning for their ability to utilize long-range node communication explicitly, addressing limitations such as oversmoothing and oversquashing found in message-passing graph networks. However, their dense attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of nodes, limiting their applicability to large-scale graphs. ReHub draws inspiration from the airline industry's hub-and-spoke model, where flights are assigned to optimize operational efficiency. In our approach, graph nodes (spokes) are dynamically reassigned to a fixed number of virtual nodes (hubs) at each model layer. Recent work, Neural Atoms (Li et al., 2024), has demonstrated impressive and consistent improvements over GNN baselines by utilizing such virtual nodes; their findings suggest that the number of hubs strongly influences performance. However, increasing the number of hubs typically raises complexity, requiring a trade-off to maintain linear complexity. Our key insight is that each node only needs to interact with a small subset of hubs to achieve linear complexity, even when the total number of hubs is large. To leverage all hubs without incurring additional computational costs, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive reassignment technique based on hub-hub similarity scores, eliminating the need for expensive node-hub computations. Our experiments on LRGB indicate a consistent improvement in results over the base method, Neural Atoms, while maintaining a linear complexity. Remarkably, our sparse model achieves performance on par with its non-sparse counterpart. Furthermore, ReHub outperforms competitive baselines and consistently ranks among top performers across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR 2025.

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated prominent performance in computer vision related tasks. However, their performance improves with increasing numbers of labeled data, indicating reliance on labeled data. Humanly annotated data are difficult to acquire and thus shifted the focus from traditional annotations to unsupervised learning strategies that learn structures inside the data. In response to this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising technique. SSL utilize inherent relationships within the data as a form of supervision. This technique can reduce the dependence on manual annotations and offers a more scalable and resource-effective approach to training models. Taking these strengths into account, it is necessary to assess the combination of SSL methods with ViTs, especially in the cases of limited labeled data. Inspired by this evolving trend, this survey aims to systematically review SSL mechanisms tailored for ViTs. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy to classify SSL techniques based on their representations and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we highlighted the motivations behind the study of SSL, reviewed prominent pre-training tasks, and highlight advancements and challenges in this field. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSL methods designed for ViTs, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 Pa...</summary><p>42 Pages, 4 Figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Recent machine learning breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists", achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold, a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task, multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks. Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control, corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle synergies across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>A.S.C...</summary><p>A.S.C. and B.A. contributed equally.

In this work, we introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future efforts by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in several iEEG tasks. MVPFormer surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer baselines in seizure detection across the SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA datasets, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on four Brain TreeBank iEEG decoding tasks. We further validate MVPA on standard time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds the performance of existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation model with SOTA clinical performance.

More precisely, this work aims to exploit the DG-discretised Navier-Stokes for two dimensional vortex-induced vibration (VIV) problems allowing for high-order of accuracy. The numerical discretisation comprises a nodal DG method on triangular grids, that includes two types of numerical fluxes: 1) the Roe approximate Riemann solver flux for non-linear advection terms, and 2) an Interior-Penalty numerical flux for non-linear diffusion terms. The nodal formulation permits the use of high order polynomial approximations without compromising computational robustness. The spatially-discrete form is integrated in time using a low-storage strong-stability preserving explicit Runge-Kutta scheme, and is coupled weakly with an implicit rigid body dynamics algorithm. The proposed algorithm successfully implements polynomial orders of $p\ge 4$ for the laminar compressible Navier-Stokes equations in massively parallel architectures. The resulting framework is firstly tested in terms of its convergence properties. Then, numerical solutions are validated with experimental and numerical data for the case of a circular cylinder at low Reynolds number, and lastly, the methodology is employed to simulate the problem of an elastically-mounted cylinder, a known configuration characterised by significant computational challenges. The above results showcase that the DG framework can be employed as an accurate and efficient, arbitrary order numerical methodology, for high fidelity fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering</p></details> |

Despite their promise, the practical application of PINNs is still constrained by several fac- tors, a primary one being their often-limited accuracy. This paper is dedicated to enhancing the accuracy of PINNs by introducing spectral-prior guided multistage strategy. We propose two methods: Spectrum- Informed Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks (SI-MSPINNs) and Multistage Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Spectrum Weighted Random Fourier Features (RFF-MSPINNs). The SI-MSPINNs integrate the core mechanism of Spectrum-Informed Multistage Neural Network (SI-MSNNs) and PINNs, in which we extract the Dominant Spectral Pattern (DSP) of residuals by the discrete Fourier transform. This DSP guides the network initialization to alleviate spectral bias, and gradually optimizes the resolution accuracy using a multistage strategy. The RFF-MSPINNs combines random Fourier features with spectral weighting methods, dynamically adjusting the frequency sampling distribution based on the residual power spectral density, allowing the network to prioritize learning high-energy physical modes. Through experimental verification of the Burgers equation and the Helmholtz equation, we show that both models significantly improve the accuracy of the original PINNs.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Natural gradient descent illuminates how gradient vectors, pointing at directions of steepest descent, can be improved by considering the local curvature of loss landscapes. We extend this perspective and show that to fully solve the problem illuminated by natural gradients in neural networks, one must recognise that correlations in the data at any linear transformation, including node responses at every layer of a neural network, cause a non-orthonormal relationship between the model's parameters. To solve this requires a method for decorrelating inputs at each individual layer of a neural network. We describe a range of methods which have been proposed for decorrelation and whitening of node output, and expand on these to provide a novel method specifically useful for distributed computing and computational neuroscience. Implementing decorrelation within multi-layer neural networks, we can show that not only is training via backpropagation sped up significantly but also existing approximations of backpropagation, which have failed catastrophically in the past, benefit significantly in their accuracy and convergence speed. This has the potential to provide a route forward for approximate gradient descent methods which have previously been discarded, training approaches for analogue and neuromorphic hardware, and potentially insights as to the efficacy and utility of decorrelation processes in the brain.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization. This work establishes VT-DTSN as a feasible, high-fidelity surrogate for cross-timepoint reconstruction and for studying tissue dynamics, enabling computational exploration of cellular behaviors and homeostasis to complement time-resolved imaging studies in biological research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for journal publication</p></details> |

Conventional detection methods mainly rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures, weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for real-world applications in automated content verification and digital forensics.</p></details> | 19 pages, 14 figures |

However, due to the unique characteristics of spectrum data, existing methods based on the time or frequency domain often struggle to separate predictable patterns from noise. To address this, we propose the Spectral Fractional Filtering and Prediction (SFFP) framework. SFFP first employs an adaptive fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) module to transform spectrum data into a suitable fractional Fourier domain, enhancing the separability of predictable trends from noise. Subsequently, an adaptive Filter module selectively suppresses noise while preserving critical predictive features within this domain. Finally, a prediction module, leveraging a complex-valued neural network, learns and forecasts these filtered trend components. Experiments on real-world spectrum data show that the SFFP outperforms leading spectrum and general forecasting methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

To address issues such as low prediction accuracy and slow real-time updates in existing models, which lead to lagging prediction results, we propose a Transformer-based spatiotemporal data prediction method (Ada-TransGNN) that integrates global spatial semantics and temporal behavior. The model constructs an efficient and collaborative spatiotemporal block set comprising a multi-head attention mechanism and a graph convolutional network to extract dynamically changing spatiotemporal dependency features from complex air quality monitoring data. Considering the interaction relationships between different monitoring points, we propose an adaptive graph structure learning module, which combines spatiotemporal dependency features in a data-driven manner to learn the optimal graph structure, thereby more accurately capturing the spatial relationships between monitoring points. Additionally, we design an auxiliary task learning module that enhances the decoding capability of temporal relationships by integrating spatial context information into the optimal graph structure representation, effectively improving the accuracy of prediction results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on a benchmark dataset and a novel dataset (Mete-air). The results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction models in short-term and long-term predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.

However, the increased number of images in MVQA inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments, which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Compared with previous token pruning approaches, our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module. VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

However, their direct deployment is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements. In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and \textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM (teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec, trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs. Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results show that VersBand outperforms baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics.

Yet, today's deployments still rely heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet operator goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Traditional methods, spanning mechanistic modeling, modal identification, and deep learning, have yet to fully overcome persistent limitations in accuracy, universal applicability, and interpretability. In this paper, a novel hierarchical neural state-space equation approach is proposed to overcome these obstacles, achieving strong representation, high interpretability, and superior adaptability to both system scale and varying operating points. Specifically, we first introduce neural state-space equations integrated with virtual state observers to accurately characterize the dynamics of power system devices, even in the presence of unmeasurable states. Subsequently, a hierarchical architecture is designed to handle the modeling complexity across a wide range of operating conditions, flexibly decoupling device and grid models to effectively mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Finally, a set of spatiotemporal data transformations and a multi-stage training strategy with a multi-objective loss function is employed to enhance the models efficiency and generalization. Numerical results on the two-machine three-bus system and the Guangdong Power Grid verify the superior performance of the proposed method, presenting it as a powerful new tool for small-signal stability analysis.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Personalized Tree-Based Progressive Regression Model for Watch-Time Prediction in Short Video Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22153v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In online video platforms, accurate watch time prediction has become a fundamental and challenging problem in video recommendation. Previous research has revealed that the accuracy of watch time prediction highly depends on both the transformation of watch-time labels and the decomposition of the estimation process. TPM (Tree based Progressive Regression Model) achieves State-of-the-Art performance with a carefully designed and effective decomposition paradigm. TPM discretizes the watch time into several ordinal intervals and organizes them into a binary decision tree, where each node corresponds to a specific interval. At each non-leaf node, a binary classifier is used to determine the specific interval in which the watch time variable most likely falls, based on the prediction outcome at its parent node. The tree structure is central to TPM, as it defines the decomposition of watch time estimation and how ordinal intervals are discretized. However, TPM uses a predefined full binary tree, which may be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, full binary trees imply equal partitioning of the watch time space, which may fail to capture the complexity of real-world distributions. Second, rather than relying on a fixed global structure, we advocate for a personalized, data-driven tree that can be learned end-to-end. Thus, we propose PTPM to enable highly personalized decomposition of watch estimation with better efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, we show that TPM suffers from selection bias due to conditional modeling and propose a simple solution. We conduct extensive experiments on offline datasets and online environments. Offline results show improved watch time accuracy, and online A/B tests further validate the effectiveness of our framework. PTPM has been fully deployed in core traffic scenarios and now serves over 400 million users daily.</p></details> | cikm'25 |

In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally, improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For 3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of 0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and reliability.

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark.

Our method operates as a local, post-optimization mechanism that applies updates to sparse parameter subsets, maintaining computational efficiency with linear scaling. SSDP serves as a lightweight event-structure regularizer, biasing the network toward biologically plausible spatio-temporal synchrony while preserving standard convergence behavior. SSDP seamlessly integrates with standard backpropagation while preserving the forward computation graph. We validate our approach across single-layer SNNs and spiking Transformers on datasets from static images to high-temporal-resolution tasks, demonstrating improved convergence stability and enhanced robustness to spike-time jitter and event noise.

Through comprehensive evaluations of models with varying sizes (285M, 570M, and 1.2B parameters) and layer counts (12, 24, and 40 layers), we demonstrate that concentrating FFNs in 70% of the consecutive middle layers consistently outperforms standard configurations for multiple downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |

However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. Moreover, the proposed sliding DFT-based recovery method outperforms higher-order difference-based recovery in terms of MSE, particularly in the low-sampling-rate and low-resolution regime. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing methods primarily address label shifts or rudimentary domain-based splits, overlooking the intricate textual-structural diversity. For example, in social networks, where users represent nodes with textual features (name, bio) while edges indicate friendship status, OOD may stem from the distinct language patterns between bot and normal users. To address this gap, we introduce the TextTopoOOD framework for evaluating detection across diverse OOD scenarios: (1) attribute-level shifts via text augmentations and embedding perturbations; (2) structural shifts through edge rewiring and semantic connections; (3) thematically-guided label shifts; and (4) domain-based divisions. Furthermore, we propose TNT-OOD to model the complex interplay between Text aNd Topology using: 1) a novel cross-attention module to fuse local structure into node-level text representations, and 2) a HyperNetwork to generate node-specific transformation parameters. This aligns topological and semantic features of ID nodes, enhancing ID/OOD distinction across structural and textual shifts. Experiments on 11 datasets across four OOD scenarios demonstrate the nuanced challenge of TextTopoOOD for evaluating OOD detection in text-rich networks.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Main |

However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem. Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore, with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of coverage in token selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://project.ironieser.cc/mmtok</p></details> |

Current approaches like search-o1 integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into multi-step reasoning processes but rely on a single, linear reasoning chain while incorporating unstructured textual information in a flat, context-agnostic manner. As a result, these approaches can lead to error accumulation throughout the reasoning chain, which significantly limits its effectiveness in medical question-answering (QA) tasks where both accuracy and traceability are critical requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MIRAGE (Multi-chain Inference with Retrieval-Augmented Graph Exploration), a novel test-time scalable reasoning framework that performs dynamic multi-chain inference over structured medical knowledge graphs. Specifically, MIRAGE 1) decomposes complex queries into entity-grounded sub-questions, 2) executes parallel inference chains, 3) retrieves evidence adaptively via neighbor expansion and multi-hop traversal, and 4) integrates answers using cross-chain verification to resolve contradictions. Experiments on three medical QA benchmarks (GenMedGPT-5k, CMCQA, and ExplainCPE) show that MIRAGE consistently outperforms GPT-4o, Tree-of-Thought variants, and other retrieval-augmented baselines in both automatic and human evaluations. Additionally, MIRAGE improves interpretability by generating explicit reasoning chains that trace each factual claim to concrete chains within the knowledge graph, making it well-suited for complex medical reasoning scenarios. The code will be available for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures (including tables), plus appendix. Submitted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We introduce the \emph{relative Fr\'echet distance} to compare two frequency functions in a homogeneous manner. We consider two streaming models: insertions only and sliding windows. We present a Tester for a certain class of functions, which decides if $f $ is close to $g$ or if $f$ is far from $g$ with high probability, when $f$ is given and $g$ is defined by a stream. If $f$ is uniform we show a space $\Omega(n)$ lower bound. If $f$ decreases fast enough, we then only use space $O(\log^2 n\cdot \log\log n)$. The analysis relies on the Spacesaving algorithm \cite{MAE2005,Z22} and on sampling the stream.</p></details> | 28 pages, 4 figures |

Existing methods to train the model can be divided into weakly and fully supervised ways. However, the former method requires a complex training framework design and can not infer new actions without an auxiliary prior. While the latter often struggle with limited annotated data and components trained from scratch despite being simpler. This study focuses on fully supervised affordance grounding and overcomes its limitations by proposing AffordanceSAM, which extends SAM's generalization capacity in segmentation to affordance grounding. Specifically, we design an affordance-adaption module and curate a coarse-to-fine annotated dataset called C2F-Aff to thoroughly transfer SAM's robust performance to affordance in a three-stage training manner. Experimental results confirm that AffordanceSAM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the AGD20K benchmark and exhibits strong generalized capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>SAM M...</summary><p>SAM Meets Affordance Grounding</p></details> |

Our method conditions a latent diffusion model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues, including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aidilayce.github.io/FollowMyHold-page/</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce TranSQL+, a template-based code generator that translates LLM computation graphs into pure SQL queries for execution in relational databases. Without relying on external libraries, TranSQL+, leverages mature database features, such as vectorized execution and out-of-core processing, for efficient inference. We further propose a row-to-column (ROW2COL) optimization that improves join efficiency in matrix operations. Evaluated on Llama3-8B and DeepSeekMoE models, TranSQL+ achieves up to 20x lower prefill latency and 4x higher decoding speed compared to DeepSpeed Inference and Llama.cpp in low-memory and CPU-only configurations. Our results highlight relational databases as a practical environment for LLMs on low-resource hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD2026</p></details> |

This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation (SPIN-Bench), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of strategic planning and social reasoning. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also conceptual inference of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle basic fact retrieval and short-range planning reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring deep multi-hop reasoning over large state spaces and socially adept coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST; with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient long-term time-series prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures, accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

In contrast to widely used indirect methods-such as those based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)-which infer reaction dynamics by fitting numerically estimated derivatives, our approach fits entire trajectories by solving a dynamically constrained optimization problem. This formulation enables the construction of reduced CRNs that are both low-dimensional and sparse, while preserving key dynamical behaviors of the original system. We develop an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Through illustrative examples, including a Drosophila circadian oscillator and a glycolytic oscillator, we demonstrate the ability of our method to recover accurate and interpretable reduced-order CRNs. Notably, the direct approach avoids the derivative estimation step and mitigates error accumulation issues inherent in indirect methods, making it a robust alternative for data-driven CRN realizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE CDC 2025.

However, deploying deep learning models on the resource-constrained computational hardware of planetary exploration platforms remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Adaptive Quantized Planetary Crater Detection System (AQ-PCDSys), a novel framework specifically engineered for real-time, onboard deployment in the computationally constrained environments of space exploration missions. AQ-PCDSys synergistically integrates a Quantized Neural Network (QNN) architecture, trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), with an Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion (AMF) module. The QNN architecture significantly optimizes model size and inference latency suitable for real-time onboard deployment in space exploration missions, while preserving high accuracy. The AMF module intelligently fuses data from Optical Imagery (OI) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at the feature level, utilizing an Adaptive Weighting Mechanism (AWM) to dynamically prioritize the most relevant and reliable sensor modality based on planetary ambient conditions. This approach enhances detection robustness across diverse planetary landscapes. Paired with Multi-Scale Detection Heads specifically designed for robust and efficient detection of craters across a wide range of sizes, AQ-PCDSys provides a computationally efficient, reliable and accurate solution for planetary crater detection, a critical capability for enabling the next generation of autonomous planetary landing, navigation, and scientific exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures.

We show that rumor spreading can be made faster at the cost of an increased amount of communication between the nodes. As a motivating example, consider the process on a complete graph of $n$ nodes: while the standard PUSH&PULL protocol takes $\Theta(\log n)$ rounds, we prove that our $k$-PUSH&PULL variant completes in $\Theta(\log_{k} n)$ rounds, with high probability. We generalize this result in an expansion-sensitive way, as has been done for the classic PUSH&PULL protocol for different notions of expansion, e.g., conductance and vertex expansion. We consider small-set vertex expanders, graphs in which every sufficiently small subset of nodes has a large neighborhood, ensuring strong local connectivity. In particular, when the expansion parameter satisfies $\phi > 1$, these graphs have a diameter of $o(\log n)$, as opposed to other standard notions of expansion. Since the graph's diameter is a lower bound on the number of rounds required for rumor spreading, this makes small-set expanders particularly well-suited for fast information dissemination. We prove that $k$-PUSH&PULL takes $O(\log_{\phi} n \cdot \log_{k} n)$ rounds in these expanders, with high probability. We complement this with a simple lower bound of $\Omega(\log_{\phi} n+ \log_{k} n)$ rounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at DISC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Knowledge Boundary of Vision Large Language Models by Sampling-Based Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18023v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the advancements made in Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs), like text Large Language Models (LLMs), they have limitations in addressing questions that require real-time information or are knowledge-intensive. Indiscriminately adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques is an effective yet expensive way to enable models to answer queries beyond their knowledge scopes. To mitigate the dependence on retrieval and simultaneously maintain, or even improve, the performance benefits provided by retrieval, we propose a method to detect the knowledge boundary of VLLMs, allowing for more efficient use of techniques like RAG. Specifically, we propose a method with two variants that fine-tune a VLLM on an automatically constructed dataset for boundary identification. Experimental results on various types of Visual Question Answering datasets show that our method successfully depicts a VLLM's knowledge boundary, based on which we are able to reduce indiscriminate retrieval while maintaining or improving the performance. In addition, we show that the knowledge boundary identified by our method for one VLLM can be used as a surrogate boundary for other VLLMs. Code will be released at https://github.com/Chord-Chen-30/VLLM-KnowledgeBoundary</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Although robust Bayesian inference has been extensively studied for univariate settings, theoretical results ensuring posterior robustness in multivariate models are scarce. We propose a novel scale mixture of multivariate normals called correlation-intact sandwich mixture, where the scale parameters are real-valued and follow the unfolded log-Pareto distribution. Our theoretical results on posterior robustness in multivariate settings emphasizes that the use of a symmetric, super heavy-tailed distribution for the scale parameters is essential in achieving posterior robustness against element-wise contamination. Posterior inference for the proposed model is feasible by an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm we developed. The superiority of the proposed method is illustrated further in simulation and empirical studies using graphical models and multivariate regression in the presence of complex outlier structures.</p></details> | 78 pages, 7 figures |

A core requirement for an effective DT is to act as a fast, accurate, and maintainable surrogate of its physical counterpart, the physical twin (PT). To this end, machine learning (ML) is frequently employed to (i) construct real-time DT prototypes using efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) derived from high-fidelity simulations of the PT's nominal behavior, and (ii) specialize these prototypes into DT instances by leveraging historical sensor data from the target PT. Despite the broad applicability of ML, its use in DT engineering remains largely ad hoc. Indeed, while conventional ML pipelines often train a single model for a specific task, DTs typically require multiple, task- and domain-dependent models. Thus, a more structured approach is required to design DTs. In this paper, we introduce DesCartes Builder, an open-source tool to enable the systematic engineering of ML-based pipelines for real-time DT prototypes and DT instances. The tool leverages an open and flexible visual data flow paradigm to facilitate the specification, composition, and reuse of ML models. It also integrates a library of parameterizable core operations and ML algorithms tailored for DT design. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of DesCartes Builder through a civil engineering use case involving the design of a real-time DT prototype to predict the plastic strain of a structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Language Models Coupled with Metacognition Can Outperform Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17959v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in speed and adaptability across various reasoning tasks, but they often struggle when strict logic or constraint enforcement is required. In contrast, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are specifically designed for complex, step-by-step reasoning, although they come with significant computational costs and slower inference times. To address these trade-offs, we employ and generalize the SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI) cognitive architecture into SOFAI-LM, which coordinates a fast LLM with a slower but more powerful LRM through metacognition. The metacognitive module actively monitors the LLM's performance and provides targeted, iterative feedback with relevant examples. This enables the LLM to progressively refine its solutions without requiring the need for additional model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on graph coloring and code debugging problems demonstrate that our feedback-driven approach significantly enhances the problem-solving capabilities of the LLM. In many instances, it achieves performance levels that match or even exceed those of standalone LRMs while requiring considerably less time. Additionally, when the LLM and feedback mechanism alone are insufficient, we engage the LRM by providing appropriate information collected during the LLM's feedback loop, tailored to the specific characteristics of the problem domain and leads to improved overall performance. Evaluations on two contrasting domains: graph coloring, requiring globally consistent solutions, and code debugging, demanding localized fixes, demonstrate that SOFAI-LM enables LLMs to match or outperform standalone LRMs in accuracy while maintaining significantly lower inference time.</p></details> | 37 Pages, 95 Figures |
| **[Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10811v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions by combining prior knowledge with ongoing function evaluations. BO constructs a probabilistic surrogate model of the objective function given the covariates, which is in turn used to inform the selection of future evaluation points through an acquisition function. For smooth continuous search spaces, Gaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as the surrogate model as they offer analytical access to posterior predictive distributions, thus facilitating the computation and optimization of acquisition functions. However, in complex scenarios involving optimization over categorical or mixed covariate spaces, GPs may not be ideal. This paper introduces Simulation Based Bayesian Optimization (SBBO) as a novel approach to optimizing acquisition functions that only requires sampling-based access to posterior predictive distributions. SBBO allows the use of surrogate probabilistic models tailored for combinatorial spaces with discrete variables. Any Bayesian model in which posterior inference is carried out through Markov chain Monte Carlo can be selected as the surrogate model in SBBO. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of SBBO using various choices of surrogate models in applications involving combinatorial optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Statistics and Computing</p></details> |

Here, we present the Vision Transformer Digital Twin Surrogate Network (VT-DTSN), a deep learning framework for predictive modeling of 3D+T imaging data from biological tissue. By leveraging Vision Transformers pretrained with DINO (Self-Distillation with NO Labels) and employing a multi-view fusion strategy, VT-DTSN learns to reconstruct high-fidelity, time-resolved dynamics of a Drosophila midgut while preserving morphological and feature-level integrity across imaging depths. The model is trained with a composite loss prioritizing pixel-level accuracy, perceptual structure, and feature-space alignment, ensuring biologically meaningful outputs suitable for in silico experimentation and hypothesis testing. Evaluation across layers and biological replicates demonstrates VT-DTSN's robustness and consistency, achieving low error rates and high structural similarity while maintaining efficient inference through model optimization.

Compared with previous token pruning approaches, our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module. VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods, achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Dynamic resource scheduling and seamless integration of containerized microservices have been leveraged herein to manage CPU, GPU, and memory allocations efficiently in multi-node clusters. Extensive experiments, using Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B parameters) [2] and Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) [3], probe throughput, latency, and concurrency and show that small models can handle up to 128 concurrent requests at sub-50 ms latency, while for larger models, saturation happens with as few as two concurrent users, with a latency of more than 2 seconds.

Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module.

To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results show that VersBand outperforms baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics.

In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific attention heads, which we identify by probing each head in a simple binary choice task. We then show that interventions on these heads generalise to the open-ended generation setting, effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We demonstrate that intervening on a few attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers or supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that applying interventions in the negative direction can prevent a common jailbreak attack. Our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviours. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety, requiring fine-grained control over the model output.

To address these issues, we propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages: 1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and 2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e., Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV 2025; Project Page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/ICCV25-MemoryTalker/</p></details> |
| **[GaussianFlowOcc: Sparse and Weakly Supervised Occupancy Estimation using Gaussian Splatting and Temporal Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17288v4)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

| **[Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17739v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite extensive efforts to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and safety rules, jailbreak attacks that exploit certain vulnerabilities continuously emerge, highlighting the need to strengthen existing LLMs with additional safety properties to defend against these attacks. However, tuning large models has become increasingly resource-intensive and may have difficulty ensuring consistent performance. We introduce Speculative Safety-Aware Decoding (SSD), a lightweight decoding-time approach that equips LLMs with the desired safety property while accelerating inference. We assume that there exists a small language model that possesses this desired property. SSD integrates speculative sampling during decoding and leverages the match ratio between the small and composite models to quantify jailbreak risks. This enables SSD to dynamically switch between decoding schemes to prioritize utility or safety, to handle the challenge of different model capacities. The output token is then sampled from a new distribution that combines the distributions of the original and the small models. Experimental results show that SSD successfully equips the large model with the desired safety property, and also allows the model to remain helpful to benign queries. Furthermore, SSD accelerates the inference time, thanks to the speculative sampling design.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP'2025 main conference; more experiments will be added to the coming camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Traffic Simulation and Management for Large-scale Urban Air Mobility: Integrating Route Guidance and Collision Avoidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01235v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the spatial heterogeneity of land use patterns in most cities, large-scale UAM deployments will likely focus on specific areas, such as intertransfer traffic between suburbs and city centers. However, large-scale UAM operations connecting multiple origin-destination pairs raise concerns about air traffic safety and efficiency due to potential conflict movements, particularly at major conflict points analogous to roadway junctions. To meet the safety and efficiency requirements of future UAM operations, this work proposes an air traffic management framework that integrates route guidance and collision avoidance. The route guidance mechanism optimizes aircraft distribution across both spatial and temporal dimensions by regulating their paths (composed of waypoints). Given the optimized paths, the collision avoidance algorithm generates collision-free aircraft trajectories between waypoints in the 3D space. To enable large-scale applications, we develop fast approximation methods for centralized path planning and adopt the velocity obstacle model for distributed collision avoidance. To our knowledge, this work is one of the first to integrate route guidance and collision avoidance for UAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables efficient and flexible UAM operations, including air traffic assignment, local congestion mitigation, and dynamic no-fly zone management. Compared with a collision-free baseline strategy, the proposed framework achieves considerable improvements in traffic safety and efficiency, with increases in the average minimum separation (+98.2%), the average travel speed (+70.2%), and the trip completion rate (+130%), along with a reduction in the energy consumption (-23.0%). The proposed framework demonstrates its potential for real-time traffic simulation and management in large-scale UAM systems.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[WaveStitch: Flexible and Fast Conditional Time Series Generation with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06231v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating temporal data under conditions is crucial for forecasting, imputation, and generative tasks. Such data often has metadata and partially observed signals that jointly influence the generated values. However, existing methods face three key limitations: (1) they condition on either the metadata or observed values, but rarely both together; (2) they adopt either training-time approaches that fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, or inference-time approaches that ignore metadata; and (3) they suffer from trade-offs between generation speed and temporal coherence across time windows--choosing either slow but coherent autoregressive methods or fast but incoherent parallel ones. We propose WaveStitch, a novel diffusion-based method to overcome these hurdles through: (1) dual-sourced conditioning on both metadata and partially observed signals; (2) a hybrid training-inference architecture, incorporating metadata during training and observations at inference via gradient-based guidance; and (3) a novel pipeline-style paradigm that generates time windows in parallel while preserving coherence through an inference-time conditional loss and a stitching mechanism. Across diverse datasets, WaveStitch demonstrates adaptability to arbitrary patterns of observed signals, achieving 1.81x lower mean-squared-error compared to the state-of-the-art, and generates data up to 166.48x faster than autoregressive methods while maintaining coherence.

| **[Sliding DFT-based Signal Recovery for Modulo ADC with 1-bit Folding Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18757v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modulo analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is a promising solution to resolve the limited dynamic range (DR) issue of conventional ADCs and achieve an enhanced digital resolution given a fixed quantization bit budget. However, a modulo ADC requires an unfolding scheme to correct the nonlinear distortion introduced by the modulo operation. This paper presents a sliding discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based method for fast signal reconstruction given the modulo ADC output sequence and a 1-bit folding information sequence. In contrast to existing DFT-based signal recovery techniques for modulo ADCs, our proposed sliding DFT method reduces the required observation time and minimizes the spectral leakage effects via proper choice of window function parameters. A mean squared error (MSE) performance guarantee is established for the proposed signal recovery algorithm. More precisely, we derive sufficient conditions for the oversampling factor ($\mathrm{OF}$) and the number of quantization bits ($b$) to obtain a specific MSE performance. Our numerical results demonstrate that modulo ADCs equipped with our proposed recovery method can outperform conventional ADCs without modulo for $\mathrm{OF} \geq 4$ and $b \geq 4$. Moreover, the proposed sliding DFT-based recovery method outperforms higher-order difference-based recovery in terms of MSE, particularly in the low-sampling-rate and low-resolution regime. The impact of spectral leakage on the MSE performance of the proposed sliding DFT recovery method is also quantified.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[ModalPrompt: Towards Efficient Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning with Dual-Modality Guided Prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05849v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit remarkable multi-tasking ability by learning mixed instruction datasets. However, novel tasks would be encountered sequentially in dynamic world, which urges for equipping LMMs with multimodal continual instruction learning (MCIT) ability especially for diverse and challenging generative tasks. Existing MCIT methods do not fully exploit the unique attribute of LMMs and often gain performance at the expense of efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for MCIT to effectively alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge while managing computational complexity with natural image-text supervision. Concretely, we learn prompts for each task and exploit efficient prompt fusion for knowledge transfer and prompt selection for complexity management with dual-modality guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial +14.26% performance gain on MCIT benchmarks with remarkable $\times$ 1.42 inference speed free from growing computation.

| **[Visual Generation Without Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15420v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been a default technique in various visual generative models, yet it requires inference from both conditional and unconditional models during sampling. We propose to build visual models that are free from guided sampling. The resulting algorithm, Guidance-Free Training (GFT), matches the performance of CFG while reducing sampling to a single model, halving the computational cost. Unlike previous distillation-based approaches that rely on pretrained CFG networks, GFT enables training directly from scratch. GFT is simple to implement. It retains the same maximum likelihood objective as CFG and differs mainly in the parameterization of conditional models. Implementing GFT requires only minimal modifications to existing codebases, as most design choices and hyperparameters are directly inherited from CFG. Our extensive experiments across five distinct visual models demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of GFT. Across domains of diffusion, autoregressive, and masked-prediction modeling, GFT consistently achieves comparable or even lower FID scores, with similar diversity-fidelity trade-offs compared with CFG baselines, all while being guidance-free. Code will be available at https://github.com/thu-ml/GFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Representative Power Flow Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11281v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality power flow datasets are essential for training machine learning models in power systems. However, security and privacy concerns restrict access to real-world data, making statistically accurate and physically consistent synthetic datasets a viable alternative. We develop a diffusion model for generating synthetic power flow datasets from real-world power grids that both replicate the statistical properties of the real-world data and ensure AC power flow feasibility. To enforce the constraints, we incorporate gradient guidance based on the power flow constraints to steer diffusion sampling toward feasible samples. For computational efficiency, we further leverage insights from the fast decoupled power flow method and propose a variable decoupling strategy for the training and sampling of the diffusion model. These solutions lead to a physics-informed diffusion model, generating power flow datasets that outperform those from the standard diffusion in terms of feasibility and statistical similarity, as shown in experiments across IEEE benchmark systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is the extended journal version of our paper at ICML 2025 Workshop "DataWorld: Unifying Data Curation Frameworks Across Domains"</p></details> |

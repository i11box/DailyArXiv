| **[GC-VLN: Instruction as Graph Constraints for Training-free Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10454v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language navigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for discrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator environments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in real-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous environments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint optimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The constraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint solving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we construct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial relationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed into a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges, which are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph constraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint solver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's navigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple solutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world experiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new environments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and autonomous navigation framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025.

| **[WhisTLE: Deeply Supervised, Text-Only Domain Adaptation for Pretrained Speech Recognition Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10452v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper perform well but still need domain adaptation to handle unseen vocabulary and parlance. In many real-world settings, collecting speech data is impractical, necessitating text-only adaptation. We propose WhisTLE, a deeply supervised, text-only adaptation method for pretrained encoder-decoder ASR models. WhisTLE trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) to model encoder outputs from text and fine-tunes the decoder using the learned text-to-latent encoder, optionally combined with text-to-speech (TTS) adaptation. At inference, the original encoder is restored, incurring no extra runtime cost. Across four out-of-domain datasets and four ASR models, WhisTLE with TTS reduces word error rate (WER) by 12.3% relative to TTS-only adaptation and outperforms all non-WhisTLE baselines in 27 of 32 scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

| **[Router-Tuning: A Simple and Effective Approach for Enabling Dynamic-Depth in Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13184v6)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional transformer models often allocate a fixed amount of computational resources to every input token, leading to inefficient and unnecessary computation. To address this, the Mixture of Depths (MoD) was introduced to dynamically adjust the computational depth by skipping less important layers. Despite its promise, current MoD approaches remain under-explored and face two main challenges: (1) high training costs due to the need to train the entire model along with the routers that determine which layers to skip, and (2) the risk of performance degradation when important layers are bypassed. In response to the first issue, we propose Router-Tuning, a method that fine-tunes only the router on a small dataset, drastically reducing the computational overhead associated with full model training. For the second challenge, we propose MindSkip, which deploys Attention with Dynamic Depths. This method preserves the model's performance while significantly enhancing computational and memory efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers competitive results while dramatically improving the computation efficiency, e.g., 21\% speedup and only a 0.2\% performance drop. The code is released at https://github.com/CASE-Lab-UMD/Router-Tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Long Context Automated Essay Scoring with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10417v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models are architecturally constrained to process text of a fixed maximum length. Essays written by higher-grade students frequently exceed the maximum allowed length for many popular open-source models. A common approach to addressing this issue when using these models for Automated Essay Scoring is to truncate the input text. This raises serious validity concerns as it undermines the model's ability to fully capture and evaluate organizational elements of the scoring rubric, which requires long contexts to assess. In this study, we evaluate several models that incorporate architectural modifications of the standard transformer architecture to overcome these length limitations using the Kaggle ASAP 2.0 dataset. The models considered in this study include fine-tuned versions of XLNet, Longformer, ModernBERT, Mamba, and Llama models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Sheaf Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09590v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equipping graph neural networks with a convolution operation defined in terms of a cellular sheaf offers advantages for learning expressive representations of heterophilic graph data. The most flexible approach to constructing the sheaf is to learn it as part of the network as a function of the node features. However, this leaves the network potentially overly sensitive to the learned sheaf. As a counter-measure, we propose a variational approach to learning cellular sheaves within sheaf neural networks, yielding an architecture we refer to as a Bayesian sheaf neural network. As part of this work, we define a novel family of reparameterizable probability distributions on the rotation group $SO(n)$ using the Cayley transform. We evaluate the Bayesian sheaf neural network on several graph datasets, and show that our Bayesian sheaf models achieve leading performance compared to baseline models and are less sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters under limited training data settings.</p></details> | 32 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Attacking Attention of Foundation Models Disrupts Downstream Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05394v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models represent the most prominent and recent paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. Foundation models are large models, trained on broad data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers (ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications. However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on several downstream tasks: classification, captioning, image/text retrieval, segmentation and depth estimation.

| **[Is Adversarial Training with Compressed Datasets Effective?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05675v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset Condensation (DC) refers to the recent class of dataset compression methods that generate a smaller, synthetic, dataset from a larger dataset. This synthetic dataset aims to retain the essential information of the original dataset, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance levels comparable to those trained on the full dataset. Most current DC methods have mainly concerned with achieving high test performance with limited data budget, and have not directly addressed the question of adversarial robustness. In this work, we investigate the impact of adversarial robustness on models trained with compressed datasets. We show that the compressed datasets obtained from DC methods are not effective in transferring adversarial robustness to models. As a solution to improve dataset compression efficiency and adversarial robustness simultaneously, we present a robustness-aware dataset compression method based on finding the Minimal Finite Covering (MFC) of the dataset. The proposed method is (1) provably robust by minimizing the generalized adversarial loss, (2) more effective than DC methods when applying adversarial training over MFC, (3) obtained by a one-time computation and is applicable for any model.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, accepted at Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis 2025 (SCIA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Learned Image Compression Through Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10366v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently. Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters, and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/FABallemand/PRIM .</p></details> | 19 pages, 21 figures |
| **[UIO-LLMs: Unbiased Incremental Optimization for Long-Context LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18173v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to limited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased incremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under long-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined encoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder respectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these memories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by treating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural networks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative incremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time complexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an unbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such as extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with minimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly linear as context length increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was not accepted, and its quality is not very good.

| **[AdaFusion: Prompt-Guided Inference with Adaptive Fusion of Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05084v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors, introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.</p></details> | 6 Tables, 11 Figures |
| **[Deep Survival Analysis from Adult and Pediatric Electrocardiograms: A Multi-center Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17002v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence applied to electrocardiography (AI-ECG) shows potential for mortality prediction, but heterogeneous approaches and private datasets have limited generalizable insights. To address this, we systematically evaluated model design choices across three large cohorts: Beth Israel Deaconess (MIMIC-IV: n = 795,546 ECGs, United States), Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (Code-15: n = 345,779, Brazil), and Boston Children's Hospital (BCH: n = 255,379, United States). We evaluated models predicting all-cause mortality, comparing horizon-based classification and deep survival methods with neural architectures including convolutional networks and transformers, benchmarking against demographic-only and gradient boosting baselines. Top models performed well (median concordance: Code-15, 0.83; MIMIC-IV, 0.78; BCH, 0.81). Incorporating age and sex improved performance across all datasets. Classifier-Cox models showed site-dependent sensitivity to horizon choice (median Pearson's R: Code-15, 0.35; MIMIC-IV, -0.71; BCH, 0.37). External validation reduced concordance, and in some cases demographic-only models outperformed externally trained AI-ECG models on Code-15. However, models trained on multi-site data outperformed site-specific models by 5-22%. Findings highlight factors for robust AI-ECG deployment: deep survival methods outperformed horizon-based classifiers, demographic covariates improved predictive performance, classifier-based models required site-specific calibration, and cross-cohort training, even between adult and pediatric cohorts, substantially improved performance. These results emphasize the importance of model type, demographics, and training diversity in developing AI-ECG models reliably applicable across populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages plus appendix</p></details> |

| **[Self-supervised Learning Of Visual Pose Estimation Without Pose Labels By Classifying LED States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10405v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a model for monocular RGB relative pose estimation of a ground robot that trains from scratch without pose labels nor prior knowledge about the robot's shape or appearance. At training time, we assume: (i) a robot fitted with multiple LEDs, whose states are independent and known at each frame; (ii) knowledge of the approximate viewing direction of each LED; and (iii) availability of a calibration image with a known target distance, to address the ambiguity of monocular depth estimation. Training data is collected by a pair of robots moving randomly without needing external infrastructure or human supervision. Our model trains on the task of predicting from an image the state of each LED on the robot. In doing so, it learns to predict the position of the robot in the image, its distance, and its relative bearing. At inference time, the state of the LEDs is unknown, can be arbitrary, and does not affect the pose estimation performance. Quantitative experiments indicate that our approach: is competitive with SoA approaches that require supervision from pose labels or a CAD model of the robot; generalizes to different domains; and handles multi-robot pose estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at CoRL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Evolving Voices Based on Temporal Poisson Factorisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18486v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The world is evolving and so is the vocabulary used to discuss topics in speech. Analysing political speech data from more than 30 years requires the use of flexible topic models to uncover the latent topics and their change in prevalence over time as well as the change in the vocabulary of the topics. We propose the temporal Poisson factorisation (TPF) model as an extension to the Poisson factorisation model to model sparse count data matrices obtained based on the bag-of-words assumption from text documents with time stamps. We discuss and empirically compare different model specifications for the time-varying latent variables consisting either of a flexible auto-regressive structure of order one or a random walk. Estimation is based on variational inference where we consider a combination of coordinate ascent updates with automatic differentiation using batching of documents. Suitable variational families are proposed to ease inference. We compare results obtained using independent univariate variational distributions for the time-varying latent variables to those obtained with a multivariate variant. We discuss in detail the results of the TPF model when analysing speeches from 18 sessions in the U.S. Senate (1981-2016).</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper: 20 pages (2 single figures, 3 double figures, 3 tables), appendix: 2 pages, supplementary materials: 18 pages (2 plots, 4 quadruple plots, 2 tables), references: 3 pages</p></details> |
| **[The Language of Approval: Identifying the Drivers of Positive Feedback Online](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10370v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positive feedback via likes and awards is central to online governance, yet which attributes of users' posts elicit rewards -- and how these vary across authors and communities -- remains unclear. To examine this, we combine quasi-experimental causal inference with predictive modeling on 11M posts from 100 subreddits. We identify linguistic patterns and stylistic attributes causally linked to rewards, controlling for author reputation, timing, and community context. For example, overtly complicated language, tentative style, and toxicity reduce rewards. We use our set of curated features to train models that can detect highly-upvoted posts with high AUC. Our audit of community guidelines highlights a ``policy-practice gap'' -- most rules focus primarily on civility and formatting requirements, with little emphasis on the attributes identified to drive positive feedback. These results inform the design of community guidelines, support interfaces that teach users how to craft desirable contributions, and moderation workflows that emphasize positive reinforcement over purely punitive enforcement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint: 21 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

| **[Fine-Grained Perturbation Guidance via Attention Head Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10978v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/HeadHunter/</p></details> |
| **[QuadricFormer: Scene as Superquadrics for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10977v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics. Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids, cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture. Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in occupied regions. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zuosc19.github.io/QuadricFormer/</p></details> |
| **[AutoMind: Adaptive Knowledgeable Agent for Automated Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10974v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

| **[Farseer: A Refined Scaling Law in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10972v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.</p></details> | 34 |
| **[Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10967v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy.

| **[SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.</p></details> | IEEE S&P 2025 |
| **[SpectralAR: Spectral Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10962v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel, contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework, which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective. Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

| **[ChineseHarm-Bench: A Chinese Harmful Content Detection Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10960v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[AssistanceZero: Scalably Solving Assistance Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07091v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assistance games are a promising alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training AI assistants. Assistance games resolve key drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential, assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards, enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex environments. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/minecraft-building-assistance-game.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10955v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough, e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work, we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$ produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.</p></details> | 38 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Domain2Vec: Vectorizing Datasets to Find the Optimal Data Mixture without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10952v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets. \textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically, \textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only $51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |
| **[TimberStrike: Dataset Reconstruction Attack Revealing Privacy Leakage in Federated Tree-Based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07605v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning has emerged as a privacy-oriented alternative to centralized Machine Learning, enabling collaborative model training without direct data sharing. While extensively studied for neural networks, the security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored. This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare, and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide preliminary insights into their design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (To appear) 2025(4)</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Discretization against an Adversary: Lipschitz bandits, Dynamic Pricing, and Auction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12367v4)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lipschitz bandits is a prominent version of multi-armed bandits that studies large, structured action spaces such as the $[0,1]$ interval, where similar actions are guaranteed to have similar rewards. A central theme here is the adaptive discretization of the action space, which gradually ``zooms in'' on the more promising regions thereof. The goal is to take advantage of ``nicer'' problem instances, while retaining near-optimal worst-case performance. While the stochastic version of the problem is well-understood, the general version with adversarial rewards is not. We provide the first algorithm (\emph{Adversarial Zooming}) for adaptive discretization in the adversarial version, and derive instance-dependent regret bounds. In particular, we recover the worst-case optimal regret bound for the adversarial version, and the instance-dependent regret bound for the stochastic version. We apply our algorithm to several fundamental applications -- including dynamic pricing and auction reserve tuning -- all under adversarial reward models. While these domains often violate Lipschitzness, our analysis only requires a weaker version thereof, allowing for meaningful regret bounds without additional smoothness assumptions. Notably, we extend our results to multi-product dynamic pricing with non-smooth reward structures, a setting which does not even satisfy one-sided Lipschitzness.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A short version of this paper, titled "Adaptive Discretization for Adversarial Lipschitz Bandits", was published in COLT21 (34th Conf. on Learning Theory).

| **[VINCIE: Unlocking In-context Image Editing from Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10941v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vincie2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Visually Descriptive Language Model for Vector Graphics Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06479v5)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

| **[Passivity-Centric Safe Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Robotic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00287v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various robotic tasks; however, its deployment in real-world scenarios, particularly in contact-rich environments, often overlooks critical safety and stability aspects. Policies without passivity guarantees can result in system instability, posing risks to robots, their environments, and human operators. In this work, we investigate the limitations of traditional RL policies when deployed in contact-rich tasks and explore the combination of energy-based passive control with safe RL in both training and deployment to answer these challenges. Firstly, we reveal the discovery that standard RL policy does not satisfy stability in contact-rich scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a \textit{passivity-aware} RL policy training with energy-based constraints in our safe RL formulation. Lastly, a passivity filter is exerted on the policy output for \textit{passivity-ensured} control during deployment. We conduct comparative studies on a contact-rich robotic maze exploration task, evaluating the effects of learning passivity-aware policies and the importance of passivity-ensured control. The experiments demonstrate that a passivity-agnostic RL policy easily violates energy constraints in deployment, even though it achieves high task completion in training. The results show that our proposed approach guarantees control stability through passivity filtering and improves the energy efficiency through passivity-aware training. A video of real-world experiments is available as supplementary material. We also release the checkpoint model and offline data for pre-training at \href{https://huggingface.co/Anonymous998/passiveRL/tree/main}{Hugging Face}.</p></details> | revision version |
| **[Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of "epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit, 2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, CoNLL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Cure: LLM-based Competitor User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15724v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Improving LLM Safety Alignment with Dual-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03710v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization (DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling, suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable directions for future research in LLM safety alignment.

Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences. Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of 30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of a manuscript submitted to ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI), under review. 39 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Our framework comprises three key innovations. First, we design a vibration-based actuator that dynamically modulates the effective finger-object friction coefficient, effectively emulating changes in gripping force. Second, we derive a sliding motion model for objects clamped in a parallel gripper with two symmetric, variable-friction contact patches. Third, we propose a motion planner that coordinates end-effector finger trajectories and fingertip vibrations to achieve the desired object pose.

| **[Towards Zero-Stall Matrix Multiplication on Energy-Efficient RISC-V Clusters for Machine Learning Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10921v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing computational demands of machine learning (ML) workloads have driven the design of ML accelerators aiming at an optimal tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility. A widely explored architecture for flexible ML accelerators is based on clusters of lightweight instruction processors sharing multi-banked L1 memory, augmented with specialized instruction extensions for key ML-related computations, such as matrix multiplication (matmul). However, instruction extensions should be coupled with microarchitectural optimizations that remove inefficiencies due to control flow (loop handling) and memory access, without drastically increasing processor complexity. Moving from a state-of-the-art (SoA) ML accelerator cluster based on RISC-V processors, we propose a low-overhead optimized microarchitecture that eliminates these inefficiencies almost entirely while retaining programmability. We introduce "zero-overhead loop nests" to remove control overheads, and a "zero-conflict memory subsystem", leveraging a novel double-buffering-aware interconnect, to eliminate bank conflicts in L1 memory. With these enhancements, we attain near-ideal utilizations between 96.1% and 99.4%, achieving 11% performance and 8% energy efficiency improvements over the baseline SoA RISC-V cluster. We demonstrate comparable utilizations and performance to a specialized SoA accelerator, with only 12% difference in energy efficiency, while providing a fully-programmable general-purpose solution supporting a significantly wider range of workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17256v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks - resulting in harmful, unethical, or biased text generations. However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging. The code for replicating the method is available at https://github.com/XuandongZhao/weak-to-strong</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 3 figures |

While existing watermarking detection techniques primarily focus on classifying entire documents as watermarked or not, they often neglect the common scenario of identifying individual watermark segments within longer, mixed-source documents. Drawing inspiration from plagiarism detection systems, we propose two novel methods for partial watermark detection. First, we develop a geometry cover detection framework aimed at determining whether there is a watermark segment in long text. Second, we introduce an adaptive online learning algorithm to pinpoint the precise location of watermark segments within the text. Evaluated on three popular watermarking techniques (KGW-Watermark, Unigram-Watermark, and Gumbel-Watermark), our approach achieves high accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. Moreover, our framework is adaptable to other watermarking techniques, offering new insights for precise watermark detection.

Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel 6G radio network planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model. Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude.

The advancement of quantum algorithms has outpaced the capabilities of existing quantum hardware, making it difficult to scale computations effectively. Additionally, inconsistencies in hardware performance and pervasive quantum noise undermine system stability and computational accuracy. To optimize quantum workloads under these constraints, strategic approaches to task scheduling and resource coordination are essential. These methods must aim to accelerate processing, retain operational fidelity, and reduce the communication burden inherent to distributed setups. One of the persistent challenges in this domain is how to efficiently divide and execute large circuits across multiple quantum processors (QPUs), especially in error-prone environments. In response, we introduce a simulation-based tool that supports distributed scheduling and concurrent execution of quantum jobs on networked QPUs connected via real-time classical channels. The tool models circuit decomposition for workloads that surpass individual QPU limits, allowing for parallel execution through inter-processor communication. Using this simulation environment, we compare four distinct scheduling techniques-among them, a model informed by reinforcement learning. These strategies are evaluated across multiple metrics, including runtime efficiency, fidelity preservation, and communication costs. Our analysis underscores the trade-offs inherent in each approach and highlights how parallelized, noise-aware scheduling can meaningfully improve computational throughput in distributed quantum infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, ICPP 2025</p></details> |

Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Long Paper (Findings)</p></details> |

Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.</p></details> | Preprint |

Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/HeadHunter/</p></details> |

Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel, contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework, which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective. Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vincie2025.github.io/</p></details> |

Previous methods can be broadly classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based, Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers. Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder in enhancing model performance.

To overcome this issue, we propose an innovative framework inspired by cognitive principles: Cognitive Belief-Driven Reinforcement Learning (CBD-RL). By incorporating cognitive heuristics, CBD-RL transforms conventional trial-and-error learning into a more structured and guided learning paradigm, simulating the human reasoning process. This framework's core is a belief system that optimizes action probabilities by integrating feedback with prior experience, thus enhancing decision making under uncertainty. It also organizes state-action pairs into meaningful categories, promoting generalization and improving sample efficiency. The concrete implementations of this framework, CBDQ, CBDPPO, and CBDSAC, demonstrate superior performance in discrete and continuous action spaces in diverse environments such as Atari and MuJoCo. By bridging cognitive science and reinforcement learning, this research opens a new avenue for developing RL systems that are more interpretable, efficient, and cognitively inspired.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025 Workshop on Models of Human Feedback for AI Alignment</p></details> |

To achieve this, we aim to connect a formal mathematical framework -- zigzag persistence from topological data analysis -- with practical and easily applicable algorithms. Zigzag persistence is particularly effective for characterizing data as it dynamically transforms across model layers. Within this framework, we introduce topological descriptors that measure how topological features, $p$-dimensional holes, persist and evolve throughout the layers. Unlike methods that assess each layer individually and then aggregate the results, our approach directly tracks the full evolutionary path of these features. This offers a statistical perspective on how prompts are rearranged and their relative positions changed in the representation space, providing insights into the system's operation as an integrated whole. To demonstrate the expressivity and applicability of our framework, we highlight how sensitive these descriptors are to different models and a variety of datasets. As a showcase application to a downstream task, we use zigzag persistence to establish a criterion for layer pruning, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while preserving the system-level perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>10+6 ...</summary><p>10+6 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

Secondly, we demonstrate how to approximately regularize GTMs using a lasso penalty towards pairwise conditional independencies, akin to Gaussian graphical models. The model's robustness and effectiveness are validated through simulations, showcasing its ability to accurately learn parametric vine copulas and identify conditional independencies.

However, they are constrained to a lower computational complexity than classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), limiting their expressivity. In contrast, RNNs lack parallelization during training, raising fundamental questions about the trade off between parallelization and expressivity. We propose implicit SSMs, which iterate a transformation until convergence to a fixed point. Theoretically, we show that implicit SSMs implement the non-linear state-transitions of RNNs. Empirically, we find that only approximate fixed-point convergence suffices, enabling the design of a scalable training curriculum that largely retains parallelization, with full convergence required only for a small subset of tokens. Our approach demonstrates superior state-tracking capabilities on regular languages, surpassing transformers and SSMs. We further scale implicit SSMs to natural language reasoning tasks and pretraining of large-scale language models up to 1.3B parameters on 207B tokens representing, to our knowledge, the largest implicit model trained to date. Notably, our implicit models outperform their explicit counterparts on standard benchmarks.

Current methods of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) often rely on task-specific models, which face significant challenges in handling diverse datasets with varying signal characteristics, fault modes and operating conditions. Inspired by advancements in generative pretrained models, we propose RmGPT, a unified model for diagnosis and prognosis tasks. RmGPT introduces a novel generative token-based framework, incorporating Signal Tokens, Prompt Tokens, Time-Frequency Task Tokens and Fault Tokens to handle heterogeneous data within a unified model architecture.

However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features for expressivity, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation, especially the success of visual autoregressive methods, we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrated the potential of this method, achieving inference speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving high-quality generation.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |

A limitation of standard normalizing flows is representing distributions with heavy tails, which arise in applications to both density estimation and variational inference. A popular current solution to this problem is to use a heavy tailed base distribution. We argue this can lead to poor performance due to the difficulty of optimising neural networks, such as normalizing flows, under heavy tailed input. We propose an alternative, "tail transform flow" (TTF), which uses a Gaussian base distribution and a final transformation layer which can produce heavy tails. Experimental results show this approach outperforms current methods, especially when the target distribution has large dimension or tail weight.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

We explore four approaches: (1) an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and (4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model (LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples, constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for pedagogical feedback assessment.

Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks. TransMLA offers a practical solution for migrating GQA-based models to the MLA structure. When combined with DeepSeek's advanced features, such as FP8 quantization and Multi-Token Prediction, even greater inference acceleration can be realized.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/fxmeng/TransMLA</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Random Masking in Self Distillation on ViT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10582v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks, random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Specifically, we achieve real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e., seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture using sparse IMUs.

However, existing ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists. We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in human-understandable language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released at: https://github.com/Yutong-Zhou-cv/BioX</p></details> |

Our goal is to meticulously analyze the performance-complexity trade-off, aiming to be competitive with the large state-of-the-art models, at a fraction of the computational requirements. We find that low-complexity convolutional models previously proposed for audio tagging can be effectively adapted for event detection (which requires frame-wise prediction) by adjusting convolutional strides, removing the global pooling, and, importantly, adding a sequence model before the (now frame-wise) classification heads. Systematic experiments reveal that the best choice for the sequence model type depends on which complexity metric is most important for the given application. We also investigate the impact of enhanced training strategies such as knowledge distillation. In the end, we show that combined with an optimized training strategy, we can reach event detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art transformers while requiring only around 5% of the parameters. We release all our pre-trained models and the code for reproducing this work to support future research in low-complexity sound event detection at https://github.com/theMoro/EfficientSED.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 33rd European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2025), Palermo, Italy</p></details> |

Cloud-based solutions often struggle with latency and resource constraints, while edge-based approaches lack the processing power for complex simulations and data-driven optimizations. To address this problem, we propose the High-Precision High-Performance Computer-enabled Digital Twin (HP2C-DT) reference architecture, which integrates High-Performance Computing (HPC) into the computing continuum. Unlike traditional setups that use HPC only for offline simulations, HP2C-DT makes it an active part of digital twin workflows, dynamically assigning tasks to edge, cloud, or HPC resources based on urgency and computational needs. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we introduce the HP2C-DT framework, a working implementation that uses COMPSs for seamless workload distribution across diverse infrastructures. We test it in a power grid use case, showing how it reduces communication bandwidth by an order of magnitude through edge-side data aggregation, improves response times by up to 2x via dynamic offloading, and maintains near-ideal strong scaling for compute-intensive workflows across a practical range of resources. These results demonstrate how an HPC-driven approach can push digital twins beyond their current limitations, making them smarter, faster, and more capable of handling real-world complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures.

Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

It has some robustness properties, but not all. We prove that the influence function of the usual distance covariance is bounded, but that its breakdown value is zero. Moreover, it has an unbounded sensitivity function, converging to the bounded influence function for increasing sample size. To address this sensitivity to outliers we construct a more robust version of distance correlation, which is based on a new data transformation. Simulations indicate that the resulting method is quite robust, and has good power in the presence of outliers. We illustrate the method on genetic data. Comparing the classical distance correlation with its more robust version provides additional insight.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in International Statistical Review as a discussion paper</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust Multimodal Emotion Recognition under Missing Modalities and Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10452v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer), and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion. To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TAC.

However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details, especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this, we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART), which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas. Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters, DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced computational overhead.

Traditional IR methods typically focus on specific types of degradation, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with complex distortions. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive overview of AiOIR, offering a taxonomy that organizes existing methods by architecture innovations, learning strategies, and key improvements. We systematically categorize prevailing approaches and critically assess the challenges these models encounter, proposing future research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. Our survey begins with an introduction to the foundational concepts of AiOIR models, followed by a categorization of typical scenarios. We then highlight key architectural and algorithmic advances in AiOIR, aiming to inspire continued innovation. To facilitate rigorous evaluation of existing methods, we collate and summarize established datasets, evaluation metrics, and common experimental settings. Finally, we present an objective comparison of open-sourced methods, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners.

| **[Revisiting Transformers with Insights from Image Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10371v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks; including LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB-30, IJB-B, and IJB-C; highlight its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower latency on mobile devices. Specifically, FaceLiVT is 8.6 faster than EdgeFace, a recent hybrid CNN-Transformer model optimized for edge devices, and 21.2 faster than a pure ViT-Based model.

This necessitates continual learning (CL) to update models online, enabling adaptation to new tasks while preserving past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Nowadays, with the flourish of large pre-trained models (LPMs), efficiency has become increasingly critical for CL, due to their substantial computational demands and growing parameter sizes. In this paper, we introduce TreeLoRA (K-D Tree of Low-Rank Adapters), a novel approach that constructs layer-wise adapters by leveraging hierarchical gradient similarity to enable efficient CL, particularly for LPMs. To reduce the computational burden of task similarity estimation, we employ bandit techniques to develop an algorithm based on lower confidence bounds to efficiently explore the task structure. Furthermore, we use sparse gradient updates to facilitate parameter optimization, making the approach better suited for LPMs. Theoretical analysis is provided to justify the rationale behind our approach, and experiments on both vision transformers (ViTs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach across various domains, including vision and natural language processing tasks.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables.

However, existing trajectory based methods lack of robustness, also oversimplify the process of information construction and fusion between different modality inputs, leading to the error accumulation problem. In this paper, we propose a tile classification based viewport prediction method with Multi-modal Fusion Transformer, namely MFTR. Specifically, MFTR utilizes transformer-based networks to extract the long-range dependencies within each modality, then mine intra- and inter-modality relations to capture the combined impact of user historical inputs and video contents on future viewport selection. In addition, MFTR categorizes future tiles into two categories: user interested or not, and selects future viewport as the region that contains most user interested tiles. Comparing with predicting head trajectories, choosing future viewport based on tile's binary classification results exhibits better robustness and interpretability. To evaluate our proposed MFTR, we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used PVS-HM and Xu-Gaze dataset. MFTR shows superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of average prediction accuracy and overlap ratio, also presents competitive computation efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ACM-MM 2023</p></details> |

Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy.

While extensively studied for neural networks, the security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored. This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare, and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide preliminary insights into their design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (To appear) 2025(4)</p></details> |

However, existing jailbreaking methods are computationally costly. In this paper, we propose the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack, an efficient inference time attack for aligned LLMs to produce harmful text. Our key intuition is based on the observation that jailbroken and aligned models only differ in their initial decoding distributions. The weak-to-strong attack's key technical insight is using two smaller models (a safe and an unsafe one) to adversarially modify a significantly larger safe model's decoding probabilities. We evaluate the weak-to-strong attack on 5 diverse open-source LLMs from 3 organizations. The results show our method can increase the misalignment rate to over 99% on two datasets with just one forward pass per example. Our study exposes an urgent safety issue that needs to be addressed when aligning LLMs. As an initial attempt, we propose a defense strategy to protect against such attacks, but creating more advanced defenses remains challenging.

Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Workshop on World Models at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks.

Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Long Paper (Findings)</p></details> |

Across these developments, a key unified paradigm has arisen: Learning from Rewards, where reward signals act as the guiding stars to steer LLM behavior. It has underpinned a wide range of prevalent techniques, such as reinforcement learning (RLHF, RLAIF, DPO, and GRPO), reward-guided decoding, and post-hoc correction. Crucially, this paradigm enables the transition from passive learning from static data to active learning from dynamic feedback. This endows LLMs with aligned preferences and deep reasoning capabilities for diverse tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of learning from rewards, from the perspective of reward models and learning strategies across training, inference, and post-inference stages. We further discuss the benchmarks for reward models and the primary applications. Finally we highlight the challenges and future directions. We maintain a paper collection at https://github.com/bobxwu/learning-from-rewards-llm-papers.</p></details> | 36 Pages |

It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[The Impact of Partial Computations on the Red-Blue Pebble Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10854v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an extension of the well-known red-blue pebble game (RBP) with partial computation steps, inspired by the recent work of Sobczyk. While the original RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in fast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be aggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation steps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in settings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended red-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model. We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue pebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some simple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal I/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor this way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations allow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions, a crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP model. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost of some prominent computational tasks. Finally, we also adapt a hardness result from RBP, showing that the optimum cost is still NP-hard to approximate in PRBP to any reasonable factor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 37th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA 2025)</p></details> |

Our objective is to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-world deployability. To that end, we develop a lightweight 1D-CNN, optimized via hardware-aware neural architecture search (HW-NAS), which achieves 96.59% accuracy on the ISCX VPN-NonVPN dataset with only 88.26K parameters, a 20.12K maximum tensor size, and 10.08M floating-point operations (FLOPs). Moreover, it generalizes across various TC tasks, with accuracies ranging from 94% to 99%. To enable deployment, the model is quantized to INT8, suffering only a marginal 1-2% accuracy drop relative to its Float32 counterpart. We evaluate real-world inference performance on two microcontrollers: the high-performance STM32F746G-DISCO and the cost-sensitive Nucleo-F401RE. The deployed model achieves inference latencies of 31.43ms and 115.40ms, with energy consumption of 7.86 mJ and 29.10 mJ per inference, respectively. These results demonstrate the feasibility of on-device encrypted traffic analysis, paving the way for scalable, low-power IoT security solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ISCC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with SlowFast: The Three Golden Principles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10848v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.</p></details> | 11 pages; 5 figures; |
| **[Efficiency Robustness of Dynamic Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10831v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference, (ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to secure future adaptive DDLSs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to USENIX Security '25</p></details> |

Unlike conventional image-based controllers, which operate at fixed rates and suffer from motion blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase to improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated environments, demonstrating robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance.

| **[Incentivizing Quality Text Generation via Statistical Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11118v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the success of large language models (LLMs) increases demand for machine-generated text, current pay-per-token pricing schemes create a misalignment of incentives known in economics as moral hazard: Text-generating agents have strong incentive to cut costs by preferring a cheaper model over the cutting-edge one, and this can be done "behind the scenes" since the agent performs inference internally. In this work, we approach this issue from an economic perspective, by proposing a pay-for-performance, contract-based framework for incentivizing quality. We study a principal-agent game where the agent generates text using costly inference, and the contract determines the principal's payment for the text according to an automated quality evaluation. Since standard contract theory is inapplicable when internal inference costs are unknown, we introduce cost-robust contracts. As our main theoretical contribution, we characterize optimal cost-robust contracts through a direct correspondence to optimal composite hypothesis tests from statistics, generalizing a result of Saig et al. (NeurIPS'23). We evaluate our framework empirically by deriving contracts for a range of objectives and LLM evaluation benchmarks, and find that cost-robust contracts sacrifice only a marginal increase in objective value compared to their cost-aware counterparts.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Built on the Hazel live programming environment, it provides a structured, interactive experience that encourages iterative exploration and real-time feedback.

| **[A Unit Enhancement and Guidance Framework for Audio-Driven Avatar Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03603v5)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose Parts-aware Audio-driven Human Animation, PAHA, a unit enhancement and guidance framework for audio-driven upper-body animation. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | revised |
| **[Testing Generalizability in Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03021v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring robust model performance in diverse real-world scenarios requires addressing generalizability across domains with covariate shifts. However, no formal procedure exists for statistically evaluating generalizability in machine learning algorithms. Existing predictive metrics like mean squared error (MSE) help to quantify the relative performance between models, but do not directly answer whether a model can or cannot generalize. To address this gap in the domain of causal inference, we propose a systematic framework for statistically evaluating the generalizability of high-dimensional causal inference models. Our approach uses the frugal parameterization to flexibly simulate from fully and semi-synthetic causal benchmarks, offering a comprehensive evaluation for both mean and distributional regression methods. Grounded in real-world data, our method ensures more realistic evaluations, which is often missing in current work relying on simplified datasets. Furthermore, using simulations and statistical testing, our framework is robust and avoids over-reliance on conventional metrics, providing statistical safeguards for decision making.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, In Proceedings for UAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM.

| **[PRSA: Prompt Stealing Attacks against Real-World Prompt Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19200v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention for their exceptional capabilities. Prompts are central to the functionality and performance of LLMs, making them highly valuable assets. The increasing reliance on high-quality prompts has driven significant growth in prompt services. However, this growth also expands the potential for prompt leakage, increasing the risk that attackers could replicate original functionalities, create competing products, and severely infringe on developers' intellectual property. Despite these risks, prompt leakage in real-world prompt services remains underexplored. In this paper, we present PRSA, a practical attack framework designed for prompt stealing. PRSA infers the detailed intent of prompts through very limited input-output analysis and can successfully generate stolen prompts that replicate the original functionality. Extensive evaluations demonstrate PRSA's effectiveness across two main types of real-world prompt services. Specifically, compared to previous works, it improves the attack success rate from 17.8% to 46.1% in prompt marketplaces and from 39% to 52% in LLM application stores, respectively. Notably, in the attack on "Math", one of the most popular educational applications in OpenAI's GPT Store with over 1 million conversations, PRSA uncovered a hidden Easter egg that had not been revealed previously. Besides, our analysis reveals that higher mutual information between a prompt and its output correlates with an increased risk of leakage. This insight guides the design and evaluation of two potential defenses against the security threats posed by PRSA. We have reported these findings to the prompt service vendors, including PromptBase and OpenAI, and actively collaborate with them to implement defensive measures.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of the paper accepted at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security 2025)</p></details> |
| **[SNR and Resource Adaptive Deep JSCC for Distributed IoT Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10699v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensor-based local inference at IoT devices faces severe computational limitations, often requiring data transmission over noisy wireless channels for server-side processing. To address this, split-network Deep Neural Network (DNN) based Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes are used to extract and transmit relevant features instead of raw data. However, most existing methods rely on fixed network splits and static configurations, lacking adaptability to varying computational budgets and channel conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel SNR- and computation-adaptive distributed CNN framework for wireless image classification across IoT devices and edge servers. We introduce a learning-assisted intelligent Genetic Algorithm (LAIGA) that efficiently explores the CNN hyperparameter space to optimize network configuration under given FLOPs constraints and given SNR. LAIGA intelligently discards the infeasible network configurations that exceed computational budget at IoT device. It also benefits from the Random Forests based learning assistance to avoid a thorough exploration of hyperparameter space and to induce application specific bias in candidate optimal configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms fixed-split architectures and existing SNR-adaptive methods, especially under low SNR and limited computational resources. We achieve a 10\% increase in classification accuracy as compared to existing JSCC based SNR-adaptive multilayer framework at an SNR as low as -10dB across a range of available computational budget (1M to 70M FLOPs) at IoT device.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, PIMRC Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13\% on GSM8K and 70\% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Diffusion-Free Graph Generation with Next-Scale Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23612v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models excel in efficiency and plug directly into the transformer ecosystem, delivering robust generalization, predictable scalability, and seamless workflows such as fine-tuning and parallelized training. However, they require an explicit sequence order, which contradicts the unordered nature of graphs. In contrast, diffusion models maintain permutation invariance and enable one-shot generation but require up to thousands of denoising steps and additional features for expressivity, leading to high computational costs. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in image generation, especially the success of visual autoregressive methods, we propose MAG, a novel diffusion-free graph generation framework based on next-scale prediction. By leveraging a hierarchy of latent representations, the model progressively generates scales of the entire graph without the need for explicit node ordering. Experiments on both generic and molecular graph datasets demonstrated the potential of this method, achieving inference speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving high-quality generation.</p></details> | Camera-ready version |

A limitation of standard normalizing flows is representing distributions with heavy tails, which arise in applications to both density estimation and variational inference. A popular current solution to this problem is to use a heavy tailed base distribution. We argue this can lead to poor performance due to the difficulty of optimising neural networks, such as normalizing flows, under heavy tailed input. We propose an alternative, "tail transform flow" (TTF), which uses a Gaussian base distribution and a final transformation layer which can produce heavy tails. Experimental results show this approach outperforms current methods, especially when the target distribution has large dimension or tail weight.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

However, due to their substantial training cost, most academic research uses open-source SAEs which are only available for a restricted set of models of up to 27B parameters. SAE latents are also learned from a dataset of activations, which means they do not transfer between models. Motivated by relative representation similarity measures, we introduce Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) models, an alternative method for decomposing language model activations. To train an ITDA, we greedily construct a dictionary of language model activations on a dataset of prompts, selecting those activations which were worst approximated by matching pursuit on the existing dictionary. ITDAs can be trained in just 1% of the time required for SAEs, using 1% of the data. This allowed us to train ITDAs on Llama-3.1 70B and 405B on a single consumer GPU. ITDAs can achieve similar reconstruction performance to SAEs on some target LLMs, but generally incur a performance penalty. However, ITDA dictionaries enable cross-model comparisons, and a simple Jaccard similarity index on ITDA dictionaries outperforms existing methods like CKA, SVCCA, and relative representation similarity metrics. ITDAs provide a cheap alternative to SAEs where computational resources are limited, or when cross model comparisons are necessary.

Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it, the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, 3 codes, oeis sequence A384735</p></details> |

However, existing ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists. We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in human-understandable language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released at: https://github.com/Yutong-Zhou-cv/BioX</p></details> |
| **[Decision Making under the Exponential Family: Distributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16829v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision making under uncertainty is challenging as the data-generating process (DGP) is often unknown. Bayesian inference proceeds by estimating the DGP through posterior beliefs on the model's parameters. However, minimising the expected risk under these beliefs can lead to suboptimal decisions due to model uncertainty or limited, noisy observations. To address this, we introduce Distributionally Robust Optimisation with Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-BAS) which hedges against model uncertainty by optimising the worst-case risk over a posterior-informed ambiguity set. We provide two such sets, based on posterior expectations (DRO-BAS(PE)) or posterior predictives (DRO-BAS(PP)) and prove that both admit, under conditions, strong dual formulations leading to efficient single-stage stochastic programs which are solved with a sample average approximation. For DRO-BAS(PE) this covers all conjugate exponential family members while for DRO-BAS(PP) this is shown under conditions on the predictive's moment generating function. Our DRO-BAS formulations outperform existing Bayesian DRO on the Newsvendor problem and achieve faster solve times with comparable robustness on the Portfolio problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication (spotlight) at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[AdaptiveLLM: A Framework for Selecting Optimal Cost-Efficient LLM for Code-Generation Based on CoT Length](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10525v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code generation efficiency, they face inherent challenges in balancing performance and inference costs across diverse programming tasks. Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation.

Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

While LLMs are usually served from cloud data centers, mission-critical and privacy-sensitive applications may require local hosting of open LLM models. Given the large GPU memory footprint needed for LLMs, edge accelerators such as Nvidia Jetson Orin AGX with 64GB of shared GPU-CPU RAM are a compelling choice. However, the feasibility and performance of LLM inference on edge accelerators is under-explored. This study presents a detailed evaluation of LLM inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX, on four SOTA models ranging from 2.7B to 32.8B parameters, such as Meta Llama3.1, Microsoft-Phi2, Deepseek-R1-Qwen. We investigate the impact of varying batch sizes, sequence lengths, and quantization levels on latency, throughput, and perplexity, and also explore various custom power modes on the Orin AGX to perform power and energy consumption analysis. Our findings offer interesting insights on the trade-offs between efficiency, inference speed and resource use, e.g., increasing the sequence length causes a decrease in token throughput and quantization causes smaller LLMs to be slower. These results can help optimize LLM serving on edge accelerators for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of short paper to appear in PAISE 2025: Mayank Arya and Yogesh Simmhan, "Understanding the Performance and Power of LLM Inferencing on Edge Accelerators" in 7th Workshop on Parallel AI and Systems for the Edge, Co-located with IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Starting Positions Matter: A Study on Better Weight Initialization for Neural Network Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10463v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32 pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Porti...</summary><p>Portions of this article have been presented as extended abstracts at the ICCV 2023 Workshop on Low Bit Quantized Neural Networks (ICCVW-LBQNN 2023) and the 2020 Conference on Vision and Intelligent Systems (CVIS 2020). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.14578, arXiv:2208.12489, arXiv:2309.13773</p></details> |
| **[VScan: Rethinking Visual Token Reduction for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22654v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multi-modal understanding by incorporating finer-grained visual perception and encoding. However, such methods incur significant computational costs due to longer visual token sequences, posing challenges for real-time deployment. To mitigate this, prior studies have explored pruning unimportant visual tokens either at the output layer of the visual encoder or at the early layers of the language model. In this work, we revisit these design choices and reassess their effectiveness through comprehensive empirical studies of how visual tokens are processed throughout the visual encoding and language decoding stages. Guided by these insights, we propose VScan, a two-stage visual token reduction framework that addresses token redundancy by: (1) integrating complementary global and local scans with token merging during visual encoding, and (2) introducing pruning at intermediate layers of the language model. Extensive experimental results across four LVLMs validate the effectiveness of VScan in accelerating inference and demonstrate its superior performance over current state-of-the-arts on sixteen benchmarks. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VScan achieves a 2.91$\times$ speedup in prefilling and a 10$\times$ reduction in FLOPs, while retaining 95.4\% of the original performance.

| **[Towards Robust Multimodal Emotion Recognition under Missing Modalities and Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10452v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer), and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion. To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TAC.

| **[Weaver: A Retargetable Compiler Framework for FPQA Quantum Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07870v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the prominent quantum computing architectures are based on superconducting technology, new quantum hardware technologies are emerging, such as Trapped Ions, Neutral Atoms (or FPQAs), Silicon Spin Qubits, etc. This diverse set of technologies presents fundamental trade-offs in terms of scalability, performance, manufacturing, and operating expenses. To manage these diverse quantum technologies, there is a growing need for a retargetable compiler that can efficiently adapt existing code to these emerging hardware platforms. Such a retargetable compiler must be extensible to support new and rapidly evolving technologies, performant with fast compilation times and high-fidelity execution, and verifiable through rigorous equivalence checking to ensure the functional equivalence of the retargeted code. To this end, we present $Weaver$, the first extensible, performant, and verifiable retargetable quantum compiler framework with a focus on FPQAs due to their unique, promising features. $Weaver$ introduces WQASM, the first formal extension of the standard OpenQASM quantum assembly with FPQA-specific instructions to support their distinct capabilities. Next, $Weaver$ implements the WOptimizer, an extensible set of FPQA-specific optimization passes to improve execution quality. Last, the WChecker automatically checks for equivalence between the original and the retargeted code. Our evaluation shows that $Weaver$ improves compilation times by $10^3\times$, execution times by $4.4\times$, and execution fidelity by $10\%$, on average, compared to superconducting and state-of-the-art (non-retargetable) FPQA compilers.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Recent works propose numerous techniques (that we call DRAM techniques) to enhance DRAM-based computing systems' throughput, reliability, and computing capabilities (e.g., in-DRAM bulk data copy). Evaluating the system-wide benefits of DRAM techniques is challenging as they often require modifications across multiple layers of the computing stack. Prior works propose FPGA-based platforms for rapid end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. Unfortunately, existing platforms fall short in two major aspects: (1) they require deep expertise in hardware description languages, limiting accessibility; and (2) they are not designed to accurately model modern computing systems. We introduce EasyDRAM, an FPGA-based framework for rapid and accurate end-to-end evaluation of DRAM techniques on real DRAM chips. EasyDRAM overcomes the main drawbacks of prior FPGA-based platforms with two key ideas. First, EasyDRAM removes the need for hardware description language expertise by enabling developers to implement DRAM techniques using a high-level language (C++). At runtime, EasyDRAM executes the software-defined memory system design in a programmable memory controller. Second, EasyDRAM tackles a fundamental challenge in accurately modeling modern systems: real processors typically operate at higher clock frequencies than DRAM, a disparity that is difficult to replicate on FPGA platforms. EasyDRAM addresses this challenge by decoupling the processor-DRAM interface and advancing the system state using a novel technique we call time scaling, which faithfully captures the timing behavior of the modeled system. We believe and hope that EasyDRAM will enable innovative ideas in memory system design to rapidly come to fruition. To aid future research EasyDRAM implementation is open sourced at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/EasyDRAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our publication at DSN 2025</p></details> |
| **[Wider or Deeper? Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04412v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |

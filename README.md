| **[SciReasoner: Laying the Scientific Reasoning Ground Across Disciplines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21320v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a scientific reasoning foundation model that aligns natural language with heterogeneous scientific representations. The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability. The model, instruct tuning datasets and the evaluation code are open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/SciReason and https://github.com/open-sciencelab/SciReason.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[SD3.5-Flash: Distribution-Guided Distillation of Generative Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21318v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment. Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly accessible for practical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hmrishavbandy.github.io/sd35flash/</p></details> |
| **[Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21317v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[SAGE: A Realistic Benchmark for Semantic Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21310v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE (Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of 0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |
| **[NewtonGen: Physics-Consistent and Controllable Text-to-Video Generation via Neural Newtonian Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21309v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances, state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis with precise parameter control.</p></details> | <details><summary>All d...</summary><p>All data and code is available at https://github.com/pandayuanyu/NewtonGen</p></details> |
| **[VerifyBench: Benchmarking Reference-based Reward Systems for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15801v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/VerifyBench Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZJU-REAL/VerifyBench Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/VerifyBench</p></details> |
| **[Constructions are Revealed in Word Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06048v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Construction grammar posits that constructions, or form-meaning pairings, are acquired through experience with language (the distributional learning hypothesis). But how much information about constructions does this distribution actually contain? Corpus-based analyses provide some answers, but text alone cannot answer counterfactual questions about what \emph{caused} a particular word to occur. This requires computable models of the distribution over strings -- namely, pretrained language models (PLMs). Here, we treat a RoBERTa model as a proxy for this distribution and hypothesize that constructions will be revealed within it as patterns of statistical affinity. We support this hypothesis experimentally: many constructions are robustly distinguished, including (i) hard cases where semantically distinct constructions are superficially similar, as well as (ii) \emph{schematic} constructions, whose ``slots'' can be filled by abstract word classes. Despite this success, we also provide qualitative evidence that statistical affinity alone may be insufficient to identify all constructions from text. Thus, statistical affinity is likely an important, but partial, signal available to learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for training scientific machine learning applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10997v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner for accelerating the training of scientific machine learning applications. The design of the proposed preconditioner is motivated by the nonlinear two-level overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioner. The neural network parameters are decomposed into groups (subdomains) with overlapping regions. In addition, the network's feed-forward structure is indirectly imposed through a novel subdomain-wise synchronization strategy and a coarse-level training step. Through a series of numerical experiments, which consider physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed two-level preconditioner significantly speeds up the convergence of the standard (LBFGS) optimizer while also yielding more accurate machine learning models. Moreover, the devised preconditioner is designed to take advantage of model-parallel computations, which can further reduce the training time.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Noncoherent Massive Random Access Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21300v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks, modeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells. To characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument is invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their codebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a generalization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in the literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the transmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading coefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed that the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model, rigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds depends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering cells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the interferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay exponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit power. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited networks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews ("Fundamental limits of cooperation", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by random user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In contrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially, then the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded capacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since the condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents interference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple access. We obtain this result by using bursty signaling together with treating interference as noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Ambiguity Resolution in Text-to-Structured Data Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11679v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[The role of synthetic data in Multilingual, Multi-cultural AI systems: Lessons from Indic Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21294v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored. We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13 Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages. These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[ButterflyQuant: Ultra-low-bit LLM Quantization through Learnable Orthogonal Butterfly Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09679v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. For LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 37.3 for QuIP. \href{https://github.com/42Shawn/Butterflyquant-llm}{Codes} are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repla...</summary><p>Replace discrete Hadamard transforms with continuous Butterfly transforms to facilitate the learning of rotation matrices in LLM quantization</p></details> |

However, due to the sheer volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data for public policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, in Portuguese language</p></details> |

In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCLIP-Lite.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically, considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video dataset collection.

| **[Aligning Distributionally Robust Optimization with Practical Deep Learning Needs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16734v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While traditional Deep Learning (DL) optimization methods treat all training samples equally, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) adaptively assigns importance weights to different samples. However, a significant gap exists between DRO and current DL practices. Modern DL optimizers require adaptivity and the ability to handle stochastic gradients, as these methods demonstrate superior performance. Additionally, for practical applications, a method should allow weight assignment not only to individual samples, but also to groups of objects (for example, all samples of the same class). This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing ALSO $\unicode{x2013}$ Adaptive Loss Scaling Optimizer $\unicode{x2013}$ an adaptive algorithm for a modified DRO objective that can handle weight assignment to sample groups. We prove the convergence of our proposed algorithm for non-convex objectives, which is the typical case for DL models. Empirical evaluation across diverse Deep Learning tasks, from Tabular DL to Split Learning tasks, demonstrates that ALSO outperforms both traditional optimizers and existing DRO methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 table, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Taxonomy-aware Dynamic Motion Generation on Hyperbolic Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21281v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural information about how movements relate to one another, this information is frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | Preprint |

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

These Superchips employ a tightly coupled heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package, which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently. SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems, enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of 13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while achieving 55% MFU.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Evidence from critical tweets identified by human annotation and large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16851v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely detection of problematic research is essential for safeguarding scientific integrity. To explore whether social media commentary can serve as an early indicator of potentially problematic articles, this study analysed 3,815 tweets referencing 604 retracted articles and 3,373 tweets referencing 668 comparable non-retracted articles. Tweets critical of the articles were identified through both human annotation and large language models (LLMs). Human annotation revealed that 8.3% of retracted articles were associated with at least one critical tweet prior to retraction, compared to only 1.5% of non-retracted articles, highlighting the potential of tweets as early warning signals of retraction. However, critical tweets identified by LLMs (GPT-4o mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3.5 Haiku) only partially aligned with human annotation, suggesting that fully automated monitoring of post-publication discourse should be applied with caution. A human-AI collaborative approach may offer a more reliable and scalable alternative, with human expertise helping to filter out tweets critical of issues unrelated to the research integrity of the articles. Overall, this study provides insights into how social media signals, combined with generative AI technologies, may support efforts to strengthen research integrity.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Grounding AI Explanations in Experience: A Reflective Cognitive Architecture for Clinical Decision Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21266v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives, often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but, more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced, highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision support systems.

| **[MedVSR: Medical Video Super-Resolution with Cross State-Space Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21265v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints. Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake, noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models, enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in reconstruction performance and efficiency.

Achieving accurate and scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

Yet this exploration rarely follows a neat, linear sequence; problem-solvers constantly shift among searching, creating, and evaluating ideas. Existing interfaces either impose rigid, step-by-step workflows or permit unguided free-form exploration. To strike a balance between flexibility and guidance for augmenting people's efficiency and creativity, we introduce a human-AI collaborative workflow that supports a fluid ideation process. The system surfaces three opt-in aids: (1) high-level schemas to uncover alternative ideas, (2) risk analysis with mitigation suggestions, and (3) steering system-generated suggestions. Users can invoke these supports at any moment, allowing seamless back-and-forth movement among design actions to maintain creative momentum.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster to ACM Collective Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

The framework integrates key components, including multi-modal embedding, cross-modal interaction, and a language model decoder, to process natural language instructions and 3D scene data. This approach facilitates enhanced reasoning and response generation in complex 3D environments. Using the ScanNet 3D scene dataset, along with text annotations from ScanQA and ScanRefer, 3D-MoRe generates 62,000 question-answer (QA) pairs and 73,000 object descriptions across 1,513 scenes. We also employ various data augmentation techniques and implement semantic filtering to ensure high-quality data. Experiments on ScanQA demonstrate that 3D-MoRe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the CIDEr score improving by 2.15\%. Similarly, on ScanRefer, our approach achieves a notable increase in CIDEr@0.5 by 1.84\%, highlighting its effectiveness in both tasks. Our code and generated datasets will be publicly released to benefit the community, and both can be accessed on the https://3D-MoRe.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |

While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations. This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at GenProCC NeurIPS 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

In this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness, efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.</p></details> | under review |

As a result, small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

They are becoming increasingly important also in the areas that have been until very recently dominated by subsymbolic knowledge representation and machine-learning (ML) based data processing. One such area is information security, and specifically, malware detection. We thus propose PE Malware Ontology that offers a reusable semantic schema for Portable Executable (PE - the Windows binary format) malware files. This ontology is inspired by the structure of the EMBER dataset, which focuses on the static malware analysis of PE files. With this proposal, we hope to provide a unified semantic representation for the existing and future PE-malware datasets and facilitate the application of symbolic, neuro-symbolic, or otherwise explainable approaches in the PE-malware-detection domain, which may produce interpretable results described by the terms defined in our ontology. In addition, we also publish semantically treated EMBER data, including fractional datasets, to support the reproducibility of experiments on EMBER. We supplement our work with a preliminary case study, conducted using concept learning, to show the general feasibility of our approach. While we were not able to match the precision of the state-of-the-art ML tools, the learned malware discriminators were interesting and highly interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2301.00153</p></details> |

However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs. To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP, which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture. Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate reasoning than the previous works.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the "CLVL: 5th Workshop on Closing the Loop Between Vision and Language (ICCV 2023 CLVL workshop)."</p></details> |

Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization. However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST, demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model attention that better reflects human intuition.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, neurips workshop</p></details> |

However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; 3D Generation</p></details> |

Recent work supports this hypothesis by showing sensitivity to constructions in pretrained language models (PLMs), including one recent study (Rozner et al., 2025) demonstrating that constructions shape RoBERTa's output distribution. However, models under study have generally been trained on developmentally implausible amounts of data, casting doubt on their relevance to human language learning. Here we use Rozner et al.'s methods to evaluate construction learning in masked language models from the 2024 BabyLM Challenge. Our results show that even when trained on developmentally plausible quantities of data, models learn diverse constructions, even hard cases that are superficially indistinguishable. We further find correlational evidence that constructional performance may be functionally relevant: models that better represent construction perform better on the BabyLM benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization, resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g., fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic imitation.

However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge. This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer (CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts. This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness. To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.</p></details> | Under Review |

We introduce SAGE (Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories: Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity, Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of 0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of model robustness for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |

Quantization reduces memory through lower numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} = (\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. In this work, we propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$ entries that are non-differentiable and thus prohibit gradient-based learning, butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. For LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 37.3 for QuIP. \href{https://github.com/42Shawn/Butterflyquant-llm}{Codes} are available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repla...</summary><p>Replace discrete Hadamard transforms with continuous Butterfly transforms to facilitate the learning of rotation matrices in LLM quantization</p></details> |

In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues.

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%.

In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role in global climate processes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21259v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

However, most methods still rely primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained, controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images, Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry, topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report; 3D Generation</p></details> |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data.

Unlike general restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy, which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.</p></details> | Paper Under Review |
| **[Scaling Laws for Online Advertisement Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13322v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling law is a notable property of neural network models and has significantly propelled the development of large language models. Scaling laws hold great promise in guiding model design and resource allocation. Recent research increasingly shows that scaling laws are not limited to NLP tasks or Transformer architectures; they also apply to domains such as recommendation. However, there is still a lack of literature on scaling law research in online advertisement retrieval systems. This may be because 1) identifying the scaling law for resource cost and online revenue is often expensive in both time and training resources for industrial applications, and 2) varying settings for different systems prevent the scaling law from being applied across various scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight paradigm to identify online scaling laws of retrieval models, incorporating a novel offline metric and an offline simulation algorithm. We prove that under mild assumptions, the correlation between the novel metric and online revenue asymptotically approaches 1 and empirically validates its effectiveness. The simulation algorithm can estimate the machine cost offline. Based on the lightweight paradigm, we can identify online scaling laws for retrieval models almost exclusively through offline experiments, and quickly estimate machine costs and revenues for given model configurations. We further validate the existence of scaling laws across mainstream model architectures (e.g., Transformer, MLP, and DSSM) in our real-world advertising system. With the identified scaling laws, we demonstrate practical applications for ROI-constrained model designing and multi-scenario resource allocation in the online advertising system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study identification and application of online scaling laws for online advertisement retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 ad...</summary><p>v2 add some theoretical analysis and experimental validation; 26 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

We establish those limitations for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match 3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all possible token triplets in an input sequence. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: function composition (Peng et al., 2024) and binary relations composition, respectively. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that, equipped with this mechanism, a one-layer transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. Importantly, we show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023), and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Compositional-ARC: Assessing Systematic Generalization in Abstract Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01445v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systematic generalization refers to the capacity to understand and generate novel combinations from known components. Despite recent progress by large language models (LLMs) across various domains, these models often fail to extend their knowledge to novel compositional scenarios, revealing notable limitations in systematic generalization. There has been an ongoing debate about whether neural networks possess the capacity for systematic generalization, with recent studies suggesting that meta-learning approaches designed for compositionality can significantly enhance this ability. However, these insights have largely been confined to linguistic problems, leaving their applicability to other tasks an open question. In this study, we extend meta-learning for compositionality to the domain of abstract spatial reasoning. To this end, we introduce $\textit{Compositional-ARC}-$a dataset designed to evaluate the capacity of models to systematically generalize from known geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) of abstract two-dimensional objects to novel combinations of these transformations (e.g., translation+rotation). Our results show that a small transformer-based encoder-decoder model, trained via meta-learning for compositionality, can systematically generalize to previously unseen transformation compositions. Notably, despite having only 5.7M parameters, this model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs$-$including o3-mini, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, which fail to exhibit similar systematic behavior$-$and performs on par with the winning model of the ARC prize 2024, an 8B-parameter LLM trained via test-time training. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of meta-learning in promoting systematicity beyond linguistic tasks, suggesting a promising direction toward more robust and generalizable models.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

The model was trained on 1.7M hours of total data samples, including Granary and NeMo ASR Set 3.0, with non-speech audio added to reduce hallucinations for ASR and AST. We describe its two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning process with dynamic data balancing, as well as experiments with an nGPT encoder. Results show nGPT scales well with massive data, while FastConformer excels after fine-tuning. For timestamps, Canary-1B-v2 uses the NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) with an auxiliary CTC model, providing reliable segment-level timestamps for ASR and AST.

Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (12 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (4 Pages)</p></details> |
| **[InComeS: Integrating Compression and Selection Mechanisms into LLMs for Efficient Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22156v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing model editing methods perform well in recalling exact edit facts, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require deeper semantic understanding rather than mere knowledge regurgitation. Leveraging the strong contextual reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) becomes a promising editing method by comprehending edit information through context encoding. However, this method is constrained by the limited context window of LLMs, leading to degraded performance and efficiency as the number of edits increases. To overcome this limitation, we propose InComeS, a flexible framework that enhances LLMs' ability to process editing contexts through explicit compression and selection mechanisms. Specifically, InComeS compresses each editing context into the key-value (KV) cache of a special gist token, enabling efficient handling of multiple edits without being restricted by the model's context window. Furthermore, specialized cross-attention modules are added to dynamically select the most relevant information from the gist pools, enabling adaptive and effective utilization of edit information. We conduct experiments on diverse model editing benchmarks with various editing formats, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.</p></details> | 18 pages,5 figures |
| **[Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208 speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent, Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses. Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice. When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech technology.</p></details> | Under Review |

While traditional hair modeling methods focus on realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime hairstyle modeling.

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks, particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs. non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT) technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97% (facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs, with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model resilience to adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Sensors + Imaging; presented on 17th of September (Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications III)</p></details> |

Unlike in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data, (ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization for unconditional and conditional generative models. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. On standard image benchmarks, our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery. We demonstrate our algorithms with datasets of increasing complexity (MNIST, CelebA and ImageNet-1K) and for generative models of increasing complexity (VAEs and diffusion transformers).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code update, diffusion transformers</p></details> |

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has emerged as a promising compression technique for LLMs, offering considerable reductions in memory overhead. However, existing SVD-based methods often struggle to effectively mitigate the errors introduced by SVD truncation, leading to a noticeable performance gap when compared to the original models. Furthermore, applying a uniform compression ratio across all transformer layers fails to account for the varying importance of different layers. To address these challenges, we propose AdaSVD, an adaptive SVD-based LLM compression approach. Specifically, AdaSVD introduces adaComp, which adaptively compensates for SVD truncation errors by alternately updating the singular matrices $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}^\top$. Additionally, AdaSVD introduces adaCR, which adaptively assigns layer-specific compression ratios based on the relative importance of each layer. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM/VLM families and evaluation metrics demonstrate that AdaSVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SVD-based methods, achieving superior performance with significantly reduced memory requirements.

Traditional approaches to graph domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization, SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task.

In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes available at: https://github.com/starmpcc/causal_mask_encodes_positional</p></details> |

However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging. One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention, which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted for IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System</p></details> |

While these tasks have driven significant progress, they primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time series modeling.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.</p></details> | 34 pages, 21 figures |

When knowledge distillation transfers these features to students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 12 pages (including 3 pages of references), 6 figures, 6 tables.

This process typically involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned, they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions, risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and retain utility through precise neural localization.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Traditional detection methods, often based on isolated analysis of email content or embedded URLs, fail to comprehensively address these evolving attacks. In this paper, we propose a dual-path phishing detection framework that integrates transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) with classical machine learning to jointly analyze email text and embedded URLs. Our approach leverages the complementary strengths of semantic analysis using fine-tuned transformer architectures (e.g., DistilBERT) and structural link analysis via character-level TF-IDF vectorization paired with classical classifiers (e.g., Random Forest). Empirical evaluation on representative email and URL datasets demonstrates that this combined approach significantly improves detection accuracy. Specifically, the DistilBERT model achieves a near-optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for textual phishing detection, while Random Forest notably outperforms other classical classifiers in identifying malicious URLs. The modular design allows flexibility for standalone deployment or ensemble integration, facilitating real-world adoption. Collectively, our results highlight the efficacy and practical value of this dual-path approach, establishing a scalable, accurate, and interpretable solution capable of enhancing email security against contemporary phishing threats.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for presentation at the ACS/IEEE 22nd International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking Noise-Resistant Vision: Key Architectural Secrets for Robust Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20939v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings, converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more robust against Gaussian noise.</p></details> | 30 pages, 5 figures |

However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

We propose Bilateral Distribution Compression (BDC), a two-stage framework that compresses along both axes while preserving the underlying distribution, with overall linear time and memory complexity in dataset size and dimension. Central to BDC is the Decoded MMD (DMMD), which quantifies the discrepancy between the original data and a compressed set decoded from a low-dimensional latent space. BDC proceeds by (i) learning a low-dimensional projection using the Reconstruction MMD (RMMD), and (ii) optimising a latent compressed set with the Encoded MMD (EMMD). We show that this procedure minimises the DMMD, guaranteeing that the compressed set faithfully represents the original distribution. Experiments show that across a variety of scenarios BDC can achieve comparable or superior performance to ambient-space compression at substantially lower cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 20 figures.

Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant. However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision, we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting, from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 fi...</summary><p>13 figures, 7 tables, code is available at https://github.com/tiny-smart/tasselnetv4</p></details> |

In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures.

Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs. To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP, which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture. Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate reasoning than the previous works.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the "CLVL: 5th Workshop on Closing the Loop Between Vision and Language (ICCV 2023 CLVL workshop)."</p></details> |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data.

We address this through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community, regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice, but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot, i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition. We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

Inspired by the neuroscientific theory of Active Inference, Interactive Inference is a first example of such approach. It offers a simplified interpretation of Active Inference that allows designers to more readily apply this theory to design and evaluation. In Interactive Inference, user behaviour is modeled as Bayesian inference on progress and goal distributions that predicts the next action. We show how the error between goal and progress distributions, or Bayesian surprise, can be modeled as a simple mean square error of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a task. The problem is that the user's capacity to process Bayesian surprise follows the logarithm of this SNR. This means errors rise quickly once average capacity is exceeded. Our model allows the quantitative analysis of performance and error using one framework that can provide real-time estimates of the mental load in users that needs to be minimized by design. We show how three basic laws of HCI, Hick's Law, Fitts' Law and the Power Law can be expressed using our model. We then test the validity of the model by empirically measuring how well it predicts human performance and error in a car following task. Results suggest that driver processing capacity indeed is a logarithmic function of the SNR of the distance to a lead car. This result provides initial evidence that Interactive Interference can be useful as a new theoretical design tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, 37 mathematical formulas, in press</p></details> |

However, transmitting high-volume raw task data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p), it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships. Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity. Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b) a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and 0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Yet, current approaches hinge on posterior approximations via Tweedie's formula, which often yield unreliable guidance, particularly in low-density regions. Stochastic optimal control (SOC), in contrast, provides principled posterior simulation but is prohibitively expensive for fast sampling. In this work, we reconcile the strengths of these paradigms by introducing Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), a novel training-free framework grounded in a surrogate SOC objective. We establish a theoretical bound on the value function, demonstrating the necessity of correcting approximate posteriors to faithfully reflect true diffusion dynamics. Leveraging Stein variational inference, SDG identifies the steepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between approximate and true posteriors. By incorporating a principled Stein correction mechanism and a novel running cost functional, SDG enables effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on molecular low-density sampling tasks suggest that SDG consistently surpasses standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential for broader diffusion-based sampling beyond high-density regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version with additional results</p></details> |

Unlike in conventional training, where data are accumulated and knowledge is reinforced, unlearning aims to selectively remove the influence of particular data points without costly retraining from scratch. To be effective and reliable, such algorithms need to achieve (i) forgetting of the undesired data, (ii) preservation of the quality of the generation, (iii) preservation of the influence of the desired training data on the model parameters, and (iv) small number of training steps. We propose fast unlearning algorithms based on loss gradient orthogonalization for unconditional and conditional generative models. We show that our algorithms are able to forget data while maintaining the fidelity of the original model. On standard image benchmarks, our algorithms achieve orders of magnitude faster unlearning times than their predecessors, such as gradient surgery. We demonstrate our algorithms with datasets of increasing complexity (MNIST, CelebA and ImageNet-1K) and for generative models of increasing complexity (VAEs and diffusion transformers).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code update, diffusion transformers</p></details> |
| **[Application of Audio Fingerprinting Techniques for Real-Time Scalable Speech Retrieval and Speech Clusterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21876v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio fingerprinting techniques have seen great advances in recent years, enabling accurate and fast audio retrieval even in conditions when the queried audio sample has been highly deteriorated or recorded in noisy conditions. Expectedly, most of the existing work is centered around music, with popular music identification services such as Apple's Shazam or Google's Now Playing designed for individual audio recognition on mobile devices. However, the spectral content of speech differs from that of music, necessitating modifications to current audio fingerprinting approaches. This paper offers fresh insights into adapting existing techniques to address the specialized challenge of speech retrieval in telecommunications and cloud communications platforms. The focus is on achieving rapid and accurate audio retrieval in batch processing instead of facilitating single requests, typically on a centralized server. Moreover, the paper demonstrates how this approach can be utilized to support audio clustering based on speech transcripts without undergoing actual speech-to-text conversion. This optimization enables significantly faster processing without the need for GPU computing, a requirement for real-time operation that is typically associated with state-of-the-art speech-to-text tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the International Convention MIPRO</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying depressive mental states with large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09487v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) may have an important role to play in mental health by facilitating the quantification of verbal expressions used to communicate emotions, feelings and thoughts. While there has been substantial and very promising work in this area, the fundamental limits are uncertain. Here, focusing on depressive symptoms, we outline and evaluate LLM performance on three critical tests. The first test evaluates LLM performance on a novel ground-truth dataset from a large human sample (n=770). This dataset is novel as it contains both standard clinically validated quantifications of depression symptoms and specific verbal descriptions of the thoughts related to each symptom by the same individual. The performance of LLMs on this richly informative data shows an upper bound on the performance in this domain, and allow us to examine the extent to which inference about symptoms generalises. Second, we test to what extent the latent structure in LLMs can capture the clinically observed patterns. We train supervised sparse auto-encoders (sSAE) to predict specific symptoms and symptom patterns within a syndrome. We find that sSAE weights can effectively modify the clinical pattern produced by the model, and thereby capture the latent structure of relevant clinical variation. Third, if LLMs correctly capture and quantify relevant mental states, then these states should respond to changes in emotional states induced by validated emotion induction interventions. We show that this holds in a third experiment with 190 participants. Overall, this work provides foundational insights into the quantification of pathological mental states with LLMs, highlighting hard limits on the requirements of the data underlying LLM-based quantification; but also suggesting LLMs show substantial conceptual alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main text - 9 pages, 6 figures;</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08683v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |

However, these tasks are often complicated by challenges such as scale inconsistencies, symmetry, and large deformations, which can lead to ambiguous matches. Previous feature-based and correspondence-based methods typically rely on geometric or semantic features to generate or polish initial potential correspondences. Some methods typically leverage specific geometric priors, such as topological preservation, to devise diverse and innovative strategies tailored to a given enhancement goal, which cannot be exhaustively enumerated. Additionally, many previous approaches rely on a single-step prediction head, which can struggle with local minima in complex matching scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative paradigm that leverages a diffusion model in matrix space for robust matching matrix estimation. Our model treats correspondence estimation as a denoising diffusion process in the matching matrix space, gradually refining the intermediate matching matrix to the optimal one. Specifically, we apply the diffusion model in the doubly stochastic matrix space for 3D-3D and 2D-3D registration tasks. In the 2D image registration task, we deploy the diffusion model in a matrix subspace where dual-softmax projection regularization is applied. For all three registration tasks, we provide adaptive matching matrix embedding implementations tailored to the specific characteristics of each task while maintaining a consistent "match-to-warp" encoding pattern. Furthermore, we adopt a lightweight design for the denoising module. In inference, once points or image features are extracted and fixed, this module performs multi-step denoising predictions through reverse sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.19919</p></details> |
| **[FURINA: Free from Unmergeable Router via LINear Aggregation of mixed experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14900v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm has been successfully integrated into Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), delivering performance gains with minimal parameter overhead. However, a key limitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router, which prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model. To overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router framework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the router by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three core innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for LoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent activation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent expert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity between the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts, which are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the output norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby enabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further sharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard MoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA block that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can be fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional inference-time cost or complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FURINA not only significantly outperforms standard LoRA but also matches or surpasses the performance of existing MoE-LoRA methods, while eliminating the extra inference-time overhead of MoE.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

As the first language based on the LLVM's Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) compiler infrastructure, Mojo aims to close performance and productivity gaps by combining Python's interoperability and CUDA-like syntax for compile-time portable GPU programming. We target four scientific workloads: a seven-point stencil (memory-bound), BabelStream (memory-bound), miniBUDE (compute-bound), and Hartree-Fock (compute-bound with atomic operations); and compare their performance against vendor baselines on NVIDIA H100 and AMD MI300A GPUs. We show that Mojo's performance is competitive with CUDA and HIP for memory-bound kernels, whereas gaps exist on AMD GPUs for atomic operations and for fast-math compute-bound kernels on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. Although the learning curve and programming requirements are still fairly low-level, Mojo can close significant gaps in the fragmented Python ecosystem in the convergence of scientific computing and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE/ACM SC25 Conference WACCPD Workshop.

They have become an increasingly critical tool for spatiotemporal forecasting and physics emulation, especially in high-stakes scenarios where robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification is required. We introduce Local Sliced Conformal Inference (LSCI), a distribution-free framework for generating function-valued, locally adaptive prediction sets for operator models. We prove finite-sample validity and derive a data-dependent upper bound on the coverage gap under local exchangeability. On synthetic Gaussian-process tasks and real applications (air quality monitoring, energy demand forecasting, and weather prediction), LSCI yields tighter sets with stronger adaptivity compared to conformal baselines. We also empirically demonstrate robustness against biased predictions and certain out-of-distribution noise regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, Preprint</p></details> |
| **[Mechanism of Task-oriented Information Removal in In-context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21012v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics, we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover, we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information removal mechanism and denoising heads.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 70 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, synchronous RL post-training often suffers from significant GPU underutilization, referred to as bubbles, caused by imbalanced response lengths within rollout steps. Many RL systems attempt to alleviate this problem by relaxing synchronization, but this can compromise training accuracy. In this paper, we introduce tail batching, a novel rollout scheduling strategy for synchronous RL that systematically consolidates prompts leading to long-tail responses into a small subset of rollout steps (long rounds), while ensuring that the majority of steps (short rounds) involve only balanced, short rollouts. By excluding long responses from short rounds and rescheduling them into a few designated long rounds, tail batching effectively reduces GPU idle time during rollouts and significantly accelerates RL training without sacrificing accuracy. We present RollPacker, a system that fully harnesses the benefits of tail batching through holistic optimizations across all three RL stages: elastic parallelism adaptation for rollout, dynamic resource allocation and scheduling for reward, and stream-based training. Empirical results show that RollPacker achieves a 2.03x-2.56x end-to-end training time reduction compared to veRL and up to 2.24x speedup compared to RLHFuse for the Qwen2.5 family of LLMs on up to 128 H800 GPUs.</p></details> | 16pages,14 figures |
| **[Binary Autoencoder for Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20997v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components (features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature extractor.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 41 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact, quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a paper accepted for the EDHPC 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.</p></details> | 34 pages, 21 figures |

The proposed structure, based on superpixel neighborhood, leads to a robust descriptor since spatial information is naturally included. The generalization of the PatchMatch method to SuperPatches, named SuperPatchMatch, is introduced. Finally, we propose a framework to perform fast segmentation and labeling from an image database, and demonstrate the potential of our approach since we outperform, in terms of computational cost and accuracy, the results of state-of-the-art methods on both face labeling and medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 2017 Selected for presentation at IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2017</p></details> |

However, existing methods like Best-of-N, majority voting, and self-reflection typically apply reasoning in a uniform way across inputs, overlooking the fact that different problems may require different levels of reasoning depth. In this work, we propose Fractional Reasoning, a training-free and model-agnostic framework that enables continuous control over reasoning intensity at inference time, going beyond the limitations of fixed instructional prompts. Our method operates by extracting the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning and reapplying it with a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to tailor its reasoning process to the complexity of each input. This supports two key modes of test-time scaling: (1) improving output quality in breadth-based strategies (e.g., Best-of-N, majority voting), and (2) enhancing the correctness of individual reasoning chains in depth-based strategies (e.g., self-reflection). Experiments on GSM8K, MATH500, and GPQA demonstrate that Fractional Reasoning consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning tasks and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, Project website: https://shengliu66.github.io/fractreason/</p></details> |

Central to this process is causal inference, uncovering the mechanisms behind observed phenomena. While randomized experiments provide strong inferences, they are often infeasible due to ethical or practical constraints. However, observational studies are prone to confounding or mediating biases. While crucial, identifying such backdoor paths is expensive and heavily depends on scientists' domain knowledge to generate hypotheses. We introduce a novel benchmark where the objective is to complete a partial causal graph. We design a benchmark with varying difficulty levels with over 4000 queries. We show the strong ability of LLMs to hypothesize the backdoor variables between a cause and its effect. Unlike simple knowledge memorization of fixed associations, our task requires the LLM to reason according to the context of the entire graph.</p></details> | EMNLP'25 Findings |

Despite that, inferring the information about where and which student teachers focus on is not trivial. Mobile eye tracking can provide vital help to solve this issue; however, the use of mobile eye tracking alone requires a significant amount of manual annotations. To address this limitation, we present an automated processing pipeline concept that requires minimal manually annotated data to recognize which student the teachers focus on. To this end, we utilize state-of-the-art face detection models and face recognition feature embeddings to train face recognition models with transfer learning in the classroom context and combine these models with the teachers' gaze from mobile eye trackers. We evaluated our approach with data collected from four different classrooms, and our results show that while it is possible to estimate the visually focused students with reasonable performance in all of our classroom setups, U-shaped and small classrooms led to the best results with accuracies of approximately 0.7 and 0.9, respectively. While we did not evaluate our method for teacher-student interactions and focused on the validity of the technical approach, as our methodology does not require a vast amount of manually annotated data and offers a non-intrusive way of handling teachers' visual attention, it could help improve instructional strategies, enhance classroom management, and provide feedback for professional teacher development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full paper at the Educational Data Mining (EDM) Conference 2025</p></details> |

However, battery research and development remain bottlenecked by the prohibitively high time and energy costs required to evaluate numerous new design candidates, particularly in battery prototyping and life testing. Despite recent progress in data-driven battery lifetime prediction, existing methods require labeled data of target designs to improve accuracy and cannot make reliable predictions until after prototyping, thus falling far short of the efficiency needed to enable rapid feedback for battery design. Here, we introduce Discovery Learning (DL), a scientific machine-learning paradigm that integrates active learning, physics-guided learning, and zero-shot learning into a human-like reasoning loop, drawing inspiration from learning theories in educational psychology. DL can learn from historical battery designs and actively reduce the need for prototyping, thus enabling rapid lifetime evaluation for unobserved material-design combinations without requiring additional data labeling. To test DL, we present 123 industrial-grade large-format lithium-ion pouch cells, spanning eight material-design combinations and diverse cycling protocols. Trained solely on public datasets of small-capacity cylindrical cells, DL achieves 7.2% test error in predicting the average cycle life under unknown device variability. This results in savings of 98% in time and 95% in energy compared to industrial practices. This work highlights the potential of uncovering insights from historical designs to inform and accelerate the development of next-generation battery technologies. DL represents a key advance toward efficient data-driven modeling and helps realize the promise of machine learning for accelerating scientific discovery and engineering innovation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text, 20 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG) methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2025)</p></details> |

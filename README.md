Recently, intrinsically interpretable GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs, and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs, balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we are the first to cast this task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent on-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked, modalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple, model-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary modality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the camera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between modalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint distribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent space, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera latents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which exploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing modality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a human-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality human motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures show the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame coherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment for both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically meaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task.

| **[Paper2Video: Automatic Video Generation from Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05096v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10 minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[VChain: Chain-of-Visual-Thought for Reasoning in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05094v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain, a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically, VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex, multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/VChain Code: https://github.com/Eyeline-Labs/VChain</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Interpret Weight Differences in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05092v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The weight diffs and DIT adapters trained in the paper can be found at https://huggingface.co/diff-interpretation-tuning/loras</p></details> |
| **[MALT: Improving Reasoning with Multi-Agent LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01928v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce answers with a single chain-of-thought, which restricts their ability to explore reasoning paths or self-correct flawed outputs in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce MALT (Multi-Agent LLM Training), a novel post-training strategy that divides the reasoning process into generation, verification, and refinement steps using a sequential pipeline of heterogeneous agents. During data generation, each agent is repeatedly sampled to form a multi-agent search tree, where final outputs are graded against ground-truth data. We then apply value iteration to propagate reward signals back to each role-conditioned model, automatically producing multi-agent post-training data without human or teacher-model supervision. Our off-policy approach allows each agent to specialize by learning from correct and incorrect trajectories, ultimately improving the end-to-end reasoning chain. On MATH, GSM8K, and CSQA, MALT surpasses the same baseline LLM with a relative improvement of 15.66%, 7.42%, and 9.40% respectively, making it an important advance towards multi-agent cooperative training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reproducing kernel methods for machine learning, PDEs, and statistics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07084v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This monograph develops a unified, application-driven framework for kernel methods grounded in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and optimal transport (OT). Part I lays the theoretical and numerical foundations on positive-definite kernels; discrete and continuous RKHS; kernel engineering and scaling maps; error assessment via kernel discrepancy/maximum mean discrepancy (MMD); and a systematic operator view of kernels. In this viewpoint, projection, gradient, divergence, and Laplace-Beltrami operators are built directly from kernels, enabling discrete analogues of differential operators and variational tools that connect learning with PDE-style modeling. Part II turns to practice across four domains. In machine learning, we treat supervised and unsupervised tasks, then develop RKHS-based generative modeling, contrasting density and projection approaches and enhancing them with OT and scalable, combinatorial assignments. We introduce clustering strategies that reduce computational burden and support large-scale regression and transport. In physics-informed modeling, we present mesh-free kernel discretizations for elliptic and time-dependent PDEs, discuss automatic differentiation, and propose high-order discrete approximations. In reinforcement learning, we formulate kernel Q-learning and non-parametric HJB methods, and show how kernel operators yield sample-efficient baselines on continuous-state, discrete-action tasks. In mathematical finance, we build nonparametric time-series models and market generators, study benchmarking and extrapolation for pricing, and apply the framework to stress testing and portfolio methods.</p></details> | 180 pages |
| **[Factuality Matters: When Image Generation and Editing Meet Structured Visuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05091v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training, and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3 million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion, and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory. Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset, model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for structured visuals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://structvisuals.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Finish First, Perfect Later: Test-Time Token-Level Cross-Validation for Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05090v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering advantages such as accelerated parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling. However, the vanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation: once a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a result, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate predictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose Tolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding strategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike existing methods that follow a single progressive unmasking procedure, Tolerator introduces a two-stage process: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii) iterative refinement by remasking and decoding a subset of tokens while treating the remaining as context. This design enables previously accepted tokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more reliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard benchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics. Experiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the baselines under the same computational budget. These findings suggest that decoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of diffusion large language models. Code and data are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures. Work in progress</p></details> |
| **[TeachLM: Post-Training LLMs for Education Using Authentic Learning Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05087v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promise of generative AI to revolutionize education is constrained by the pedagogical limits of large language models (LLMs). A major issue is the lack of access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual students. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language is inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000 hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy. We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model that enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues. Building on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol that leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data significantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling student talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by 50%, and greater personalization of instruction.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Stochastic Subspace via Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis for Characterizing Model Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19963v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via several numerical examples in computational mechanics and structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Computational Mechanics, a journal</p></details> |
| **[Learning Penalty for Optimal Partitioning via Automatic Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07413v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Changepoint detection identifies significant shifts in data sequences, making it important in areas like finance, genetics, and healthcare. The Optimal Partitioning algorithms efficiently detect these changes, using a penalty parameter to limit the changepoints count. Determining the optimal value for this penalty can be challenging. Traditionally, this process involved manually extracting statistical features, such as sequence length or variance to make the prediction. This study proposes a novel approach that uses recurrent networks to learn this penalty directly from raw sequences by automatically extracting features. Experiments conducted on 20 benchmark genomic datasets show that this novel method generally outperforms traditional ones in changepoint detection accuracy.</p></details> | 9 Figures |
| **[Using cognitive models to reveal value trade-offs in language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20666v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Value trade-offs are an integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science, so-called "cognitive models" provide formal accounts of such trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. Here we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning "effort" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models' default behavior, and demonstrate that these patterns shift in predictable ways when models are prompted to prioritize certain goals over others. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. Our framework offers a flexible tool for probing value trade-offs across diverse model types, providing insights for generating hypotheses about other social behaviors such as sycophancy and for shaping training regimes that better control trade-offs between values during model development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[SAEdit: Token-level control for continuous image editing via Sparse AutoEncoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05081v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://ronen94.github.io/SAEdit/</p></details> |

| **[ResMimic: From General Motion Tracking to Humanoid Whole-body Loco-Manipulation via Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05070v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation promises transformative capabilities for daily service and warehouse tasks. While recent advances in general motion tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these policies lack the precision and object awareness required for loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion, serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements. An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness over strong baselines.

Vision based strategies often struggle in the environments due to gaps, curved crop rows and require post-processing steps. Furthermore, labeling crop rows in under the canopy environments accurately is very difficult due to occlusions. This study introduces RowDetr, an efficient end-to-end transformer-based neural network for crop row detection in precision agriculture. RowDetr leverages a lightweight backbone and a hybrid encoder to model straight, curved, or occluded crop rows with high precision. Central to the architecture is a novel polynomial representation that enables direct parameterization of crop rows, eliminating computationally expensive post-processing. Key innovations include a PolySampler module and multi-scale deformable attention, which work together with PolyOptLoss, an energy-based loss function designed to optimize geometric alignment between predicted and the annotated crop rows, while also enhancing robustness against labeling noise. RowDetr was evaluated against other state-of-the-art end-to-end crop row detection methods like AgroNav and RolColAttention on a diverse dataset of 6,962 high-resolution images, used for training, validation, and testing across multiple crop types with annotated crop rows. The system demonstrated superior performance, achieved an F1 score up to 0.74 and a lane position deviation as low as 0.405. Furthermore, RowDetr achieves a real-time inference latency of 6.7ms, which was optimized to 3.5ms with INT8 quantization on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. This work highlighted the critical efficiency of polynomial parameterization, making RowDetr particularly suitable for deployment on edge computing devices in agricultural robotics and autonomous farming equipment.

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, under submission</p></details> |

However, we find that direct implementations of power transforms suffer from severe numerical instabilities, which can lead to incorrect results or even crashes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the sources of these instabilities and propose effective remedies. We further extend power transforms to the federated learning setting, addressing both numerical and distributional challenges that arise in this context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods are both effective and robust, substantially improving stability compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, the robustness of these models against adversarial example attacks in the context of vulnerability detection remains an open question. This paper proposes NatGVD, a novel attack methodology that generates natural adversarial vulnerable code to circumvent GNN-based and graph-aware transformer-based vulnerability detectors. NatGVD employs a set of code transformations that modify graph structure while preserving code semantics. Instead of injecting dead or unrelated code like previous works, NatGVD considers naturalness requirements: generated examples should not be easily recognized by humans or program analysis tools. With extensive evaluation of NatGVD on state-of-the-art vulnerability detection systems, the results reveal up to 53.04% evasion rate across GNN-based detectors and graph-aware transformer-based detectors. We also explore potential defense strategies to enhance the robustness of these systems against NatGVD.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures (2 additional figures in Appendices)</p></details> |

The first result shows that two graphs are model equivalent if and only if they have the same skeleton and equivalent induced 4-node subgraphs. We also give a transformational characterization via structured edge reversals. The two theorems are Lyapunov analogues of celebrated results for Bayesian networks by Verma and Pearl, and Chickering, respectively. Our results have broad consequences for the theory of causal inference of GCLMs. First, we find that model equivalence classes of acyclic GCLMs refine the corresponding classes of Bayesian networks. Furthermore, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms to test model equivalence and structural identifiability of given directed acyclic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Bidirectional Mammogram View Translation with Column-Aware and Implicit 3D Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04947v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings, demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM2...</summary><p>BIBM2025 accept, 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[The Geometry of Truth: Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04933v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 14 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables.

Unlike mainstream implicit neural models, 3D GS uses millions of learnable 3D Gaussians for an explicit scene representation. Paired with a differentiable rendering algorithm, this approach achieves real-time rendering and unprecedented editability, making it a potential game-changer for 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in explicit radiance field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project; Paper list: https://github.com/guikunchen/Awesome3DGS ; Benchmark: https://github.com/guikunchen/3DGS-Benchmarks</p></details> |

We propose a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear (linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals. White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower signal-to-noise ratio while S-Mamba shows specific trend-noise and iTransformer shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed, offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Numbe...</summary><p>Number of pages: 13 Number of figures: 16 Number of Tables: 1 Submitted to: IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

However, how these approaches can complement each other within a unified framework remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose a multi-view learning framework that integrates contrastive principles into a generative pipeline to capture sound source and device information. Our method encodes compressed audio latents into view-specific and view-common subspaces, guided by two self-supervised objectives: contrastive learning for targeted information flow between subspaces, and reconstruction for overall information preservation. We evaluate our method on an urban sound sensor network dataset for sound source and sensor classification, demonstrating improved downstream performance over traditional SSL techniques. Additionally, we investigate the model's potential to disentangle environmental sound attributes within the structured latent space under varied training configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DCASE 2025 Workshop. 4+1 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We show that for a wave field with random phases, the normal form transformation is valid by dominant probability if $\beta \ll 1/N^{1+\epsilon}$, with $N$ the number of masses and $\epsilon$ an arbitrarily small constant. To obtain this condition, a bound is needed for a summation in the transformation equation, which we prove rigorously in the paper. The condition also suggests that the importance of the non-resonant terms in the evolution equation is governed by the parameter $\beta N$. We design numerical experiments to demonstrate that this is indeed the case for spectra at both thermal-equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions. The methodology developed in this paper is applicable to other Hamiltonian systems where a normal form transformation needs to be applied.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

We offer an under-studied perspective by examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal that if language models were able to better control their visual information, their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training their visual encoder and language model components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[On Predicting Post-Click Conversion Rate via Counterfactual Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04816v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various recommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These systems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and conversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on clicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks. However, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a substantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address this issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While these frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked and non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this background, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels for non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting to answer the question, "Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked the recommended item?" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual Inference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal model (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical intervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs. We then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs into binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples. Finally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process. Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method on latent conversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Main, 28 pages, 11 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method.

Although many data-driven RCA models have been proposed, we find that existing benchmarks are often oversimplified and fail to capture real-world conditions. Our preliminary study shows that simple rule-based methods can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on four widely used benchmarks, suggesting performance overestimation due to benchmark simplicity. To address this, we systematically analyze popular RCA benchmarks and identify key limitations in fault injection, call graph design, and telemetry patterns. Based on these insights, we develop an automated framework to generate more realistic benchmarks, yielding a dataset of 1,430 validated failure cases from 9,152 injections, covering 25 fault types under dynamic workloads with hierarchical ground-truth labels and verified SLI impact. Re-evaluation of 11 SOTA models on this dataset shows low Top@1 accuracy (average 0.21, best 0.37) and significantly longer execution times. Our analysis highlights three common failure patterns: scalability issues, observability blind spots, and modeling bottlenecks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project is available on https://operationspai.github.io/</p></details> |

| **[Semantic Channel Equalization Strategies for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04674v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for end-to-end semantic communications, jointly learning to compress and protect task-relevant features over noisy channels. However, existing DeepJSCC schemes assume a shared latent space at transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) - an assumption that fails in multi-vendor deployments where encoders and decoders cannot be co-trained. This mismatch introduces "semantic noise", degrading reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. In this paper, we systematize and evaluate methods for semantic channel equalization for DeepJSCC, introducing an additional processing stage that aligns heterogeneous latent spaces under both physical and semantic impairments. We investigate three classes of aligners: (i) linear maps, which admit closed-form solutions; (ii) lightweight neural networks, offering greater expressiveness; and (iii) a Parseval-frame equalizer, which operates in zero-shot mode without the need for training. Through extensive experiments on image reconstruction over AWGN and fading channels, we quantify trade-offs among complexity, data efficiency, and fidelity, providing guidelines for deploying DeepJSCC in heterogeneous AI-native wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of IEEE Globecom 2025 Workshops</p></details> |
| **[TANTE: Time-Adaptive Operator Learning via Neural Taylor Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08574v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) has seen rapid progress in recent years, enabling efficient approximation of complex spatiotemporal dynamics. However, most existing methods rely on fixed time step sizes during rollout, which limits their ability to adapt to varying temporal complexity and often leads to error accumulation. Here, we propose the Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion (TANTE), a novel operator-learning framework that produces continuous-time predictions with adaptive step sizes. TANTE predicts future states by performing a Taylor expansion at the current state, where neural networks learn both the higher-order temporal derivatives and the local radius of convergence. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its rollout based on the local behavior of the solution, thereby reducing cumulative error and improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TANTE across a wide range of PDE benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to fixed-step baselines, delivering accuracy gains of 60-80 % and speed-ups of 30-40 % at inference time.

The medical question summary (MQS) task aims to transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs), but existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of question focus and model hallucination. This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning is prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content. To this end, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance. First, a prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from the CHQs that is faithful to the original text. Then, a fine-tuning dataset is constructed in combination with the original CHQ-FAQ pairs to improve the ability to identify the focus of the question. Finally, a multi-dimensional quality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively improve the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two widely-adopted MQS datasets using three established evaluation metrics. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all measures, demonstrating a significant boost in the model's ability to identify critical focus of questions and a notable mitigation of hallucinations.

Existing efficiency methods often require additional retraining or fine-tuning, limiting their practicality. Recent findings suggest that deep neural networks exhibit internal representation similarities. While such similarities across different models have been exploited for enabling techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network redundancy remains underexplored as a source for efficiency gains. In this paper, we introduce TOAST (Transformer Optimization using Adaptive and Simple Transformations), a framework that exploits these redundancies to approximate entire transformer blocks with lightweight closed-form mappings, such as linear transformation or even the identity, without any additional training. Across SOTA pretrained vision models (e.g., ViT, DINOv2, DeiT) and datasets ranging from MNIST to ImageNet-1k, TOAST reduces parameters and computation while preserving, and in some cases improving, downstream performance. These results show that large portions of transformer depth can be replaced by trivial functions, opening a new perspective on efficient foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 15 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

However, systematic measurement of governmental OSS adoption remain limited. Research Aim: This study contributes to digital government maturity indexes by analyzing policies and support actions leveraging OSS for software reuse and collaborative development across 16 digitally mature countries, and proposing potential indicators for said indexes. It examines OSS policy formation, stated goals, key actors, and support mechanisms. Methodology: A qualitative approach is used combining desk research of policy documents with semi-structured interviews of government representatives, producing detailed country reports. These are cross-analyzed, focusing on OSS policy promotion, rationale, and implementation support. Results: Policies facilitating OSS reuse are widespread, targeting both inbound acquisition and outbound sharing, and are predominantly governed by central public sector organizations. Policy goals include interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency, with security framed both as a risk and strength. Implementation is supported by diverse Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at multiple government levels, which foster capacity building, resource pooling, and sustainable project governance. Indicators are synthesized and proposed across 14 areas covering policy incentives and design, and implementation and support. Conclusions: OSS is a strategic enabler for public sector digital transformation. Clear policy frameworks, coupled with institutional support such as OSPOs, are essential. International digital maturity frameworks should expand OSS indicators to better guide and assess government adoption and impact.</p></details> | In submission |

However, their large size and computational complexity present significant challenges for deploying them in resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an innovative approach for integrating Mamba Architecture within a Progressive Knowledge Distillation (PKD) process to address the challenge of reducing model complexity while maintaining accuracy in image classification tasks. The proposed framework distills a large teacher model into progressively smaller student models, designed using Mamba blocks. Each student model is trained using Selective-State-Space Models (S-SSM) within the Mamba blocks, focusing on important input aspects while reducing computational complexity. The work's preliminary experiments use MNIST and CIFAR-10 as datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. For MNIST, the teacher model achieves 98% accuracy. A set of seven student models as a group retained 63% of the teacher's FLOPs, approximating the teacher's performance with 98% accuracy. The weak student used only 1% of the teacher's FLOPs and maintained 72% accuracy. Similarly, for CIFAR-10, the students achieved 1% less accuracy compared to the teacher, with the small student retaining 5% of the teacher's FLOPs to achieve 50% accuracy. These results confirm the flexibility and scalability of Mamba Architecture, which can be integrated into PKD, succeeding in the process of finding students as weak learners.

We identify a critical dilemma underpinning this gap: incorporating more RVQ layers improves audio reconstruction fidelity but exceeds the generation capacity of conventional LMs. To address this, we first analyze RVQ dynamics and uncover two key limitations: 1) orthogonality of features across RVQ layers hinders effective LMs training, and 2) descending semantic richness in tokens from deeper RVQ layers exacerbates exposure bias during autoregressive decoding. Based on these insights, we propose Siren, a novel LM-based framework that employs multiple isolated transformers with causal conditioning and anti-causal alignment via reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Siren outperforms both existing LM-based and diffusion-based T2A systems, achieving state-of-the-art results. By bridging the representational strengths of LMs with the fidelity demands of audio synthesis, our approach repositions LMs as competitive contenders against diffusion models in T2A tasks. Moreover, by aligning audio representations with linguistic structures, Siren facilitates a promising pathway toward unified multi-modal generation frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

However, a finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the \textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$ independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks. Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%} of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, and procedural planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |

| **[VChain: Chain-of-Visual-Thought for Reasoning in Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05094v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain, a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically, VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex, multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://eyeline-labs.github.io/VChain Code: https://github.com/Eyeline-Labs/VChain</p></details> |
| **[Factuality Matters: When Image Generation and Editing Meet Structured Visuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05091v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training, and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3 million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion, and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory. Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset, model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for structured visuals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://structvisuals.github.io</p></details> |
| **[TeachLM: Post-Training LLMs for Education Using Authentic Learning Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05087v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The promise of generative AI to revolutionize education is constrained by the pedagogical limits of large language models (LLMs). A major issue is the lack of access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual students. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language is inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000 hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy. We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model that enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues. Building on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol that leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data significantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling student talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by 50%, and greater personalization of instruction.</p></details> | 28 pages, 9 figures |
| **[RowDetr: End-to-End Crop Row Detection Using Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10525v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crop row detection enables autonomous robots to navigate in gps denied environments. Vision based strategies often struggle in the environments due to gaps, curved crop rows and require post-processing steps. Furthermore, labeling crop rows in under the canopy environments accurately is very difficult due to occlusions. This study introduces RowDetr, an efficient end-to-end transformer-based neural network for crop row detection in precision agriculture. RowDetr leverages a lightweight backbone and a hybrid encoder to model straight, curved, or occluded crop rows with high precision. Central to the architecture is a novel polynomial representation that enables direct parameterization of crop rows, eliminating computationally expensive post-processing. Key innovations include a PolySampler module and multi-scale deformable attention, which work together with PolyOptLoss, an energy-based loss function designed to optimize geometric alignment between predicted and the annotated crop rows, while also enhancing robustness against labeling noise. RowDetr was evaluated against other state-of-the-art end-to-end crop row detection methods like AgroNav and RolColAttention on a diverse dataset of 6,962 high-resolution images, used for training, validation, and testing across multiple crop types with annotated crop rows. The system demonstrated superior performance, achieved an F1 score up to 0.74 and a lane position deviation as low as 0.405. Furthermore, RowDetr achieves a real-time inference latency of 6.7ms, which was optimized to 3.5ms with INT8 quantization on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. This work highlighted the critical efficiency of polynomial parameterization, making RowDetr particularly suitable for deployment on edge computing devices in agricultural robotics and autonomous farming equipment.

| **[Video-LMM Post-Training: A Deep Dive into Video Reasoning with Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05034v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

| **[Curiosity-Driven Co-Development of Action and Language in Robots Through Self-Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05013v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human infants acquire language and action co-developmentally, achieving remarkable generalization capabilities from only a minimal number of learning examples. In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 14 pages of supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Cooperative Decentralized Backdoor Attacks on Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09320v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries alter model behavior on target classification labels by embedding triggers into data samples. While these attacks have received considerable attention in horizontal FL, they are less understood for vertical FL (VFL), where devices hold different features of the samples, and only the server holds the labels. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor attack on VFL which (i) does not rely on gradient information from the server and (ii) considers potential collusion among multiple adversaries for sample selection and trigger embedding. Our label inference model augments variational autoencoders with metric learning, which adversaries can train locally. A consensus process over the adversary graph topology determines which datapoints to poison. We further propose methods for trigger splitting across the adversaries, with an intensity-based implantation scheme skewing the server towards the trigger. Our convergence analysis reveals the impact of backdoor perturbations on VFL indicated by a stationarity gap for the trained model, which we verify empirically as well. We conduct experiments comparing our attack with recent backdoor VFL approaches, finding that ours obtains significantly higher success rates for the same main task performance despite not using server information. Additionally, our results verify the impact of collusion on attack performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review in the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking Special Issue on AI and Networking</p></details> |
| **[Reinforce-Ada: An Adaptive Sampling Framework for Reinforce-Style LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04996v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01171v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., "Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities"). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 27 figures, 31 tables.

| **[Efficient Navigation in Unknown Indoor Environments with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04991v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel high-level planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to improve autonomous navigation in unknown indoor environments with many dead ends. Traditional exploration methods often take inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local heuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about an occupancy map in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to lead to more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid into a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each subgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We integrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \cite{kondo2025dynus}, a state-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation efficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms, corridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a goal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy failures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\% shorter paths on average.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Structural Identifiability of Graphical Continuous Lyapunov Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04985v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove two characterizations of model equivalence of acyclic graphical continuous Lyapunov models (GCLMs) with uncorrelated noise. The first result shows that two graphs are model equivalent if and only if they have the same skeleton and equivalent induced 4-node subgraphs. We also give a transformational characterization via structured edge reversals. The two theorems are Lyapunov analogues of celebrated results for Bayesian networks by Verma and Pearl, and Chickering, respectively. Our results have broad consequences for the theory of causal inference of GCLMs. First, we find that model equivalence classes of acyclic GCLMs refine the corresponding classes of Bayesian networks. Furthermore, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms to test model equivalence and structural identifiability of given directed acyclic graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Hanabi: Evaluating Multi-Agent Gameplays with Theory-of-Mind and Rationale Inference in Imperfect Information Collaboration Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04980v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective multi-agent collaboration requires agents to infer the rationale behind others' actions, a capability rooted in Theory-of-Mind (ToM). While recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability to infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored. This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and ToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive correlation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM (interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than second-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight that for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a partner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude that prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the collaborative capabilities of future models.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Wordplay |
| **[Pivotal CLTs for Pseudolikelihood via Conditional Centering in Dependent Random Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04972v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study fluctuations of conditionally centered statistics of the form $$N^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^N c_i(g(\sigma_i)-\mathbb{E}_N[g(\sigma_i)|\sigma_j,j\neq i])$$ where $(\sigma_1,\ldots ,\sigma_N)$ are sampled from a dependent random field, and $g$ is some bounded function. Our first main result shows that under weak smoothness assumptions on the conditional means (which cover both sparse and dense interactions), the above statistic converges to a Gaussian \emph{scale mixture} with a random scale determined by a \emph{quadratic variance} and an \emph{interaction component}. We also show that under appropriate studentization, the limit becomes a pivotal Gaussian. We leverage this theory to develop a general asymptotic framework for maximum pseudolikelihood (MPLE) inference in dependent random fields. We apply our results to Ising models with pairwise as well as higher-order interactions and exponential random graph models (ERGMs). In particular, we obtain a joint central limit theorem for the inverse temperature and magnetization parameters via the joint MPLE (to our knowledge, the first such result in dense, irregular regimes), and we derive conditionally centered edge CLTs and marginal MPLE CLTs for ERGMs without restricting to the ``sub-critical" region. Our proof is based on a method of moments approach via combinatorial decision-tree pruning, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 73 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Pragmatic Embodied Spoken Instruction Following in Human-Robot Collaboration with Theory of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10849v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spoken language instructions are ubiquitous in agent collaboration. However, in real-world human-robot collaboration, following human spoken instructions can be challenging due to various speaker and environmental factors, such as background noise or mispronunciation. When faced with noisy auditory inputs, humans can leverage the collaborative context in the embodied environment to interpret noisy spoken instructions and take pragmatic assistive actions. In this paper, we present a cognitively inspired neurosymbolic model, Spoken Instruction Following through Theory of Mind (SIFToM), which leverages a Vision-Language Model with model-based mental inference to enable robots to pragmatically follow human instructions under diverse speech conditions. We test SIFToM in both simulated environments (VirtualHome) and real-world human-robot collaborative settings with human evaluations. Results show that SIFToM can significantly improve the performance of a lightweight base VLM (Gemini 2.5 Flash), outperforming state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and approaching human-level accuracy on challenging spoken instruction following tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MARS: Optimizing Dual-System Deep Research via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04935v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools, such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9% across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.</p></details> | Ongoing Work |

This study compares four object detection models--YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet--for motorbike detection using a custom dataset of 198 images collected in Kigali. Implemented in PyTorch with transfer learning, the models were evaluated for accuracy, localization, and inference speed to assess their suitability for real-time navigation in resource-constrained settings. We identify implementation challenges, including dataset limitations and model complexities, and recommend simplified architectures for future work to enhance accessibility for autonomous systems in developing countries like Rwanda.</p></details> | 3 figures, 2 tables |

However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps. Our code and data are released at https://future-item.github.io/autoimagine-site/.</p></details> | Published in TMLR |

These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain. To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures. \mu DeepIQA is publicly available at https://git.photonicdata.science/elena.corbetta/udeepiqa</p></details> |

Instead of assuming idealized distributions to carry out quenched averages analytically, we use a variational Gaussian approximation for the replicated system in grand canonical formalism in which the data average can be deferred and replaced by empirical averages, leading to stationarity conditions that adaptively determine the parameters of the trial Hamiltonian for each dataset. This approach clarifies how fluctuations affect information extraction and connects directly with the results of mathematical statistics or learning theory such as information criteria. As a concrete application, we analyze linear regression and derive learning curves. This includes cases with real-world datasets, where exact replica calculations are not feasible.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or ''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data, which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of 12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions, categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASCE ...</summary><p>ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering 2024</p></details> |

| **[From Actions to Kinesics: Extracting Human Psychological States through Bodily Movements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04844v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from 3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable, accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)</p></details> |
| **[Detailed Aerial Mapping of Photovoltaic Power Plants Through Semantically Significant Keypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04840v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model suitable for power plant maintenance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 18 figures |

We introduce a static BCFP that mirrors the bond-convolution used by directed message-passing GNNs like ChemProp, and evaluate it with a fast rapid Random Forest model on Brain-Blood Barrier Penetration (BBBP) classification task. Across stratified cross-validation, concatenating ECFP with BCFP consistently improves AUROC and AUPRC over either descriptor alone, as confirmed by Turkey HSD multiple-comparison analysis. Among radii, r = 1 performs best; r = 2 does not yield statistically separable gains under the same test. We further propose BCFP-Sort&Slice, a simple feature-combination scheme that preserves the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) count information native to ECFP count vectors while enabling compact unhashed concatenation of BCFP variants. We also outperform the MGTP prediction on our BBBP evaluation, using such composite new features bond and atom features. These results show that lightweight, bond-centered descriptors can complement atom-centered circular fingerprints and provide strong, fast baselines for BBBP prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[On Predicting Post-Click Conversion Rate via Counterfactual Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04816v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various recommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These systems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and conversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on clicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks. However, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a substantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address this issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While these frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked and non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this background, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels for non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting to answer the question, "Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked the recommended item?" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual Inference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal model (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical intervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs. We then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs into binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples. Finally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process. Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method on latent conversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Main, 28 pages, 11 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

While these hybrid models show promising performance, systematic comparisons of hybridization strategies and analyses on the key factors behind their effectiveness have not been clearly shared to the community. In this work, we present a holistic evaluation of hybrid architectures based on inter-layer (sequential) or intra-layer (parallel) fusion. We evaluate these designs from a variety of perspectives: language modeling performance, long-context capabilities, scaling analysis, and training and inference efficiency. By investigating the core characteristics of their computational primitive, we identify the most critical elements for each hybridization strategy and further propose optimal design recipes for both hybrid models. Our comprehensive analysis provides practical guidance and valuable insights for developing hybrid language models, facilitating the optimization of architectural configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables; detailed results will be included in the Appendix later</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04792v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing GFlowNet-based methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) typically employ Trajectory Balance (TB) to achieve global optimization but often neglect important aspects of local optimization. While Detailed Balance (DB) addresses local optimization more effectively, it alone falls short in solving VRPs, which inherently require holistic trajectory optimization. To address these limitations, we introduce the Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet (HBG) framework, which uniquely integrates TB and DB in a principled and adaptive manner by aligning their intrinsically complementary strengths. Additionally, we propose a specialized inference strategy for depot-centric scenarios like the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), leveraging the depot node's greater flexibility in selecting successors. Despite this specialization, HBG maintains broad applicability, extending effectively to problems without explicit depots, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We evaluate HBG by integrating it into two established GFlowNet-based solvers, i.e., AGFN and GFACS, and demonstrate consistent and significant improvements across both CVRP and TSP, underscoring the enhanced solution quality and generalization afforded by our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Rationality-Driven Agentic System for Quantitative Financial Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04787v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems have shown exceptional decision-making capabilities, revealing significant potential for autonomic finance. Current financial trading agents predominantly simulate anthropomorphic roles that inadvertently introduce emotional biases and rely on peripheral information, while being constrained by the necessity for continuous inference during deployment. In this paper, we pioneer the harmonization of strategic depth in agents with the mechanical rationality essential for quantitative trading. Consequently, we present TiMi (Trade in Minutes), a rationality-driven multi-agent system that architecturally decouples strategy development from minute-level deployment. TiMi leverages specialized LLM capabilities of semantic analysis, code programming, and mathematical reasoning within a comprehensive policy-optimization-deployment chain. Specifically, we propose a two-tier analytical paradigm from macro patterns to micro customization, layered programming design for trading bot implementation, and closed-loop optimization driven by mathematical reflection. Extensive evaluations across 200+ trading pairs in stock and cryptocurrency markets empirically validate the efficacy of TiMi in stable profitability, action efficiency, and risk control under volatile market dynamics.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |

To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we explicitly bootstrap such ability to alleviate overthinking in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition of LRMs. Specifically, we first inject difficulty hypnosis into output prefixes to guide the model toward adaptive reasoning depth, trained on a hybrid dataset mixing short and long reasoning paths. Then, we incorporate redundancy hypnosis, which supervises the intermediate reasoning steps to identify and eliminate unnecessary reasoning patterns. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs by over 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear signs of difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection and looping).</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Silent Tokens, Loud Effects: Padding in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01238v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked, implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |

Despite this promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient dLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://parallelbench.github.io</p></details> |

FloorplanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as (e.g., kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and others), encoded symbolically in JSON or XML layouts. The benchmark covers core spatial tasks, including distance measurement, visibility, path finding, and object placement within constrained spaces. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs reveal that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to respect physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, though they remain mostly robust to small spatial perturbations. FloorplanQA uncovers a blind spot in today's LLMs: inconsistent reasoning about indoor layouts. We hope this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2, P...</summary><p>v2, Project page: https://OldDelorean.github.io/FloorplanQA/</p></details> |

While ICL offers fast adaptation across natural language tasks and domains, its emergence is less straightforward for modalities beyond text. In this work, we systematically uncover properties present in LLMs that support the emergence of ICL for autoregressive models and various modalities by promoting the learning of the needed mechanisms for ICL. We identify exact token repetitions in the training data sequences as an important factor for ICL. Such repetitions further improve stability and reduce transiency in ICL performance. Moreover, we emphasise the significance of training task difficulty for the emergence of ICL. Finally, by applying our novel insights on ICL emergence, we unlock ICL capabilities for various visual datasets and a more challenging EEG classification task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Best ...</summary><p>Best Paper Honorable Mention at GCPR 2025 (German Conference on Pattern Recognition).

| **[ViTs: Teaching Machines to See Time Series Anomalies Like Human Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04710v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data, they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images, temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size, thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2) anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will be publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ViTs-C484/.</p></details> | 13 pages |

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |

Two popular approaches are linear interpolation, which linearly interpolates between model weights, and task arithmetic, which combines task vectors obtained by the difference between finetuned and base models. While useful in practice, what properties make merging effective are poorly understood. This paper explores how the optimization process affects the loss landscape geometry and its impact on merging success. We show that a single quantity -- the effective noise scale -- unifies the impact of optimizer and data choices on model merging. Across architectures and datasets, the effectiveness of merging success is a non-monotonic function of effective noise, with a distinct optimum. Decomposing this quantity, we find that larger learning rates, stronger weight decay, smaller batch sizes, and data augmentation all independently modulate the effective noise scale, exhibiting the same qualitative trend. Unlike prior work that connects optimizer noise to the flatness or generalization of individual minima, we show that it also affects the global loss landscape, predicting when independently trained solutions can be merged. Our findings broaden the understanding of how optimization shapes the loss landscape geometry and its downstream consequences for model merging, suggesting the possibility of further manipulating the training dynamics to improve merging effectiveness.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[TANTE: Time-Adaptive Operator Learning via Neural Taylor Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08574v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operator learning for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) has seen rapid progress in recent years, enabling efficient approximation of complex spatiotemporal dynamics. However, most existing methods rely on fixed time step sizes during rollout, which limits their ability to adapt to varying temporal complexity and often leads to error accumulation. Here, we propose the Time-Adaptive Transformer with Neural Taylor Expansion (TANTE), a novel operator-learning framework that produces continuous-time predictions with adaptive step sizes. TANTE predicts future states by performing a Taylor expansion at the current state, where neural networks learn both the higher-order temporal derivatives and the local radius of convergence. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its rollout based on the local behavior of the solution, thereby reducing cumulative error and improving computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TANTE across a wide range of PDE benchmarks, achieving superior accuracy and adaptability compared to fixed-step baselines, delivering accuracy gains of 60-80 % and speed-ups of 30-40 % at inference time. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zwu88/TANTE for transparency and reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating unintended concept interference.

In particular, seemingly innocuous multimodal inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model outputs. While multimodal safety has received increasing attention, existing approaches often fail to address such latent risks, especially when harmfulness arises only from the interaction between modalities. We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free, intent-aware safety framework that proactively detects harmful intent in multimodal inputs and uses it to guide the generation of safe responses. SIA follows a three-stage process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning; (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; and (3) intent-conditioned response generation. By dynamically adapting to the implicit intent inferred from an image-text pair, SIA mitigates harmful outputs without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments on safety benchmarks, including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, show that SIA consistently improves safety and outperforms prior training-free methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems(SafeMM-AI) Workshop at ICCV2025, Non-archival track</p></details> |

This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are replaced by textual descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction, and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on movement-informed psychological inference.</p></details> | 4 Figures, 4 Tables |

This inference overhead becomes the primary bottleneck when such models are employed in practice to sample large numbers of molecular candidates. This work discusses a training-free caching strategy that accelerates molecular geometry generation by predicting intermediate hidden states across solver steps. The proposed method operates directly on the SE(3)-equivariant backbone, is compatible with pretrained models, and is orthogonal to existing training-based accelerations and system-level optimizations. Experiments on the GEOM-Drugs dataset demonstrate that caching achieves a twofold reduction in wall-clock inference time at matched sample quality and a speedup of up to 3x compared to the base model with minimal sample quality degradation. Because these gains compound with other optimizations, applying caching alongside other general, lossless optimizations yield as much as a 7x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AI for Science Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

The output of the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized nonverbal behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH ASIA 2025 (Conference Track); Project page: https://pku-mocca.github.io/Social-Agent-Page/</p></details> |

| **[Virtual Fitting Room: Generating Arbitrarily Long Videos of Virtual Try-On from a Single Image -- Technical Preview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04450v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process, eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data, while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments. To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions, making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://immortalco.github.io/VirtualFittingRoom/</p></details> |
| **[TRUST-VL: An Explainable News Assistant for General Multimodal Misinformation Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04448v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also offering strong generalization and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025; Project Homepage: https://yanzehong.github.io/trust-vl/</p></details> |
| **[Fuzzy to Clear: Elucidating the Threat Hunter Cognitive Process and Cognitive Support Needs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04348v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With security threats increasing in frequency and severity, it is critical that we consider the important role of threat hunters. These highly-trained security professionals learn to see, identify, and intercept security threats. Many recent works and existing tools in cybersecurity are focused on automating the threat hunting process, often overlooking the critical human element. Our study shifts this paradigm by emphasizing a human-centered approach to understanding the lived experiences of threat hunters. By observing threat hunters during hunting sessions and analyzing the rich insights they provide, we seek to advance the understanding of their cognitive processes and the tool support they need. Through an in-depth observational study of threat hunters, we introduce a model of how they build and refine their mental models during threat hunting sessions. We also present 23 themes that provide a foundation to better understand threat hunter needs and suggest five actionable design propositions to enhance the tools that support them. Through these contributions, our work enriches the theoretical understanding of threat hunting and provides practical insights for designing more effective, human-centered cybersecurity tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 Pa...</summary><p>22 Pages; 5 Figures; 8 Tables</p></details> |
| **[ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks depends significantly on the quality of their instructions, which often require substantial human effort to craft. This underscores the need for automated instruction optimization. However, optimizing instructions is particularly challenging when working with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients are inaccessible. We introduce ACING, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework that formulates instruction optimization as a stateless, continuous-action problem, enabling exploration of infinite instruction spaces using only black-box feedback. ACING automatically discovers prompts that outperform human-written prompts in 76% of instruction-induction tasks, with gains of up to 33 points and a 10-point median improvement over the best automatic baseline in 33 tasks spanning instruction-induction, summarization, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Extensive ablations highlight its robustness and efficiency. An implementation of ACING is available at https://github.com/salmakh1/ACING.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding sparse autoencoder scaling in the presence of feature manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02565v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents). The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features) influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, short workshop submission</p></details> |
| **[Durian: Dual Reference-guided Portrait Animation with Attribute Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04434v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/durian</p></details> |
| **[Design and Development of a Web Platform for Blood Donation Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04423v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location, and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Echo State Networks as State-Space Models: A Systems Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04422v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient, readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters (leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.</p></details> | 27 pages, 1 figure |
| **[SAFE--MA--RRT: Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Data-Driven Safety Certificates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04413v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints, using only data and convex optimization tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Few-step Flow for 3D Generation via Marginal-Data Transport Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04406v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/Zanue/MDT-dist</p></details> |
| **[When the Past Misleads: Rethinking Training Data Expansion Under Temporal Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01060v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive models are typically trained on historical data to predict future outcomes. While it is commonly assumed that training on more historical data would improve model performance and robustness, data distribution shifts over time may undermine these benefits. This study examines how expanding historical data training windows under covariate shifts (changes in feature distributions) and concept shifts (changes in feature-outcome relationships) affects the performance and algorithmic fairness of predictive models. First, we perform a simulation study to explore scenarios with varying degrees of covariate and concept shifts in training data. Absent distribution shifts, we observe performance gains from longer training windows though they reach a plateau quickly; in the presence of concept shift, performance may actually decline. Covariate shifts alone do not significantly affect model performance, but may complicate the impact of concept shifts. In terms of fairness, models produce more biased predictions when the magnitude of concept shifts differs across sociodemographic groups; for intersectional groups, these effects are more complex and not simply additive. Second, we conduct an empirical case study of student retention prediction, a common machine learning application in education, using 12 years of student records from 23 minority-serving community colleges in the United States. We find concept shifts to be a key contributor to performance degradation when expanding the training window. Moreover, model fairness is compromised when marginalized populations have distinct data distribution shift patterns from their peers. Overall, our findings caution against conventional wisdom that "more data is better" and underscore the importance of using historical data judiciously, especially when it may be subject to data distribution shifts, to improve model performance and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Eighth AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AIES 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Modular Techniques for Synthetic Long-Context Data Generation in Language Model Training and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01185v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture, and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable, controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |
| **[No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in Resume Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias) to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group, people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13% if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work, design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and determining which are subject to oversight.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 2025 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society; code available at https://github.com/kyrawilson/No-Thoughts-Just-AI</p></details> |
| **[Self-adaptive Dataset Construction for Real-World Multimodal Safety Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04403v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally, we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Transition Models: Rethinking the Generative Learning Objective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04394v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost, while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators, TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is released at https://github.com/WZDTHU/TiM</p></details> |
| **[Accelerated Interactive Auralization of Highly Reverberant Spaces using Graphics Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04390v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactive acoustic auralization allows users to explore virtual acoustic environments in real-time, enabling the acoustic recreation of concert hall or Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) that are either no longer accessible, acoustically altered, or impractical to visit. Interactive acoustic synthesis requires real-time convolution of input signals with a set of synthesis filters that model the space-time acoustic response of the space. The acoustics in concert halls and HWS are both characterized by a long reverberation time, resulting in synthesis filters containing many filter taps. As a result, the convolution process can be computationally demanding, introducing significant latency that limits the real-time interactivity of the auralization system. In this paper, the implementation of a real-time multichannel loudspeaker-based auralization system is presented. This system is capable of synthesizing the acoustics of highly reverberant spaces in real-time using GPU-acceleration. A comparison between traditional CPU-based convolution and GPU-accelerated convolution is presented, showing that the latter can achieve real-time performance with significantly lower latency. Additionally, the system integrates acoustic synthesis with acoustic feedback cancellation on the GPU, creating a unified loudspeaker-based auralization framework that minimizes processing latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Journal of the Audio Engineering Society</p></details> |
| **[Safety-Critical Multi-Agent MCTS for Mixed Traffic Coordination at Unsignalized Roundabout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01856v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making at unsignalized roundabouts poses substantial challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in mixed traffic environments where AVs must coordinate safely with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This paper presents a safety-critical multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework that integrates both deterministic and probabilistic prediction models to facilitate cooperative decision-making in complex roundabout scenarios. The proposed framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical safety assessment module that systematically addresses AV-to-AV (A2A), AV-to-HDV (A2H), and AV-to-Road (A2R) interactions through dynamic safety thresholds and spatiotemporal risk evaluation; (2) an adaptive HDV behavior prediction scheme that combines the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) with probabilistic uncertainty modeling; and (3) a multi-objective reward optimization strategy that jointly considers safety, efficiency, and cooperative intent. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach under both fully autonomous (100% AVs) and mixed traffic (50% AVs + 50% HDVs) conditions. Compared to benchmark methods, our framework consistently reduces trajectory deviations across all AVs and significantly lowers the rate of Post-Encroachment Time (PET) violations, achieving only 1.0\% in the fully autonomous scenario and 3.2% in the mixed traffic setting.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[On the impact of unlimited computational power in OBLOT: consequences for synchronous robots on graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04383v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The OBLOT model has been extensively studied in theoretical swarm robotics. It assumes weak capabilities for the involved mobile robots, such as they are anonymous, disoriented, no memory of past events (oblivious), and silent. Their only means of (implicit) communication is transferred to their positioning, i.e., stigmergic information. These limited capabilities make the design of distributed algorithms a challenging task. Over the last two decades, numerous research papers have addressed the question of which tasks can be accomplished within this model. Nevertheless, as it usually happens in distributed computing, also in OBLOT the computational power available to the robots is neglected as the main cost measures for the designed algorithms refer to the number of movements or the number of rounds required. In this paper, we prove that for synchronous robots moving on finite graphs, the unlimited computational power (other than finite time) has a significant impact. In fact, by exploiting it, we provide a definitive resolution algorithm that applies to a wide class of problems while guaranteeing the minimum number of moves and rounds.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

However, as sequence length increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention. Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, reviewing lengthy video footage is impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared, and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise. Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model, MiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning mode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform similar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants showing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MiniC...</summary><p>MiniCPM4 Technical Report</p></details> |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions. To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISPA2025</p></details> |

It offers higher computational efficiency than Bayesian calibration, making it suitable for high-dimensional problems. However, in real physical systems, outputs are often functional, such as time series or spatial fields, and conventional HM cannot fully exploit such information. We propose a novel method, Functional History Matching (FHM), which extends HM to handle functional data. FHM incorporates the Outer Product Emulator, an extension of the Gaussian Process emulator designed for time series, to enhance computational efficiency. FHM also leverages Random Projection to extract dynamic features from infinite-dimensional data, including derivatives. FHM supports uncertainty quantification essential for decision-making and naturally accommodates model discrepancies. To demonstrate its practical effectiveness, we apply FHM to a synthetic tsunami forecasting scenario in the Indian Ocean, assuming a realistic event in the Makran subduction zone. Wave elevation time series from offshore buoy data are used to predict wave elevations over the Indian coastline. Our results show that FHM significantly outperforms scalar-based HM in accuracy. FHM enables reliable forecasting from functional data within feasible computational constraints, offering a robust framework for early warning systems and beyond.</p></details> | 56 pages, 20 figures |

However, dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning. Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts. Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks. Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other. Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

Traditional methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing, which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs. The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover, LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data grows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the lack of focus on the needs of these stakeholders results in their limited acceptance and skepticism toward automating the whole fact-checking process. In this study, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with Central European fact-checkers. Their activities and problems were analyzed using iterative content analysis. The most significant problems were validated with a survey of European fact-checkers, in which we collected 24 responses from 20 countries, i.e., 62% of active European signatories of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Our contributions include an in-depth examination of the variability of fact-checking work in non-English-speaking regions, which still remained largely uncovered. By aligning them with the knowledge from prior studies, we created conceptual models that help to understand the fact-checking processes. In addition, we mapped our findings on the fact-checkers' activities and needs to the relevant tasks for AI research, while providing a discussion on three AI tasks that were not covered by previous similar studies. The new opportunities identified for AI researchers and developers have implications for the focus of AI research in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 13 figures, 2 annexes.

To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/durian</p></details> |

Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/Zanue/MDT-dist</p></details> |

However, reviewing lengthy video footage is impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

To address key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro) contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling spatial dependencies.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures, under review for journal publication</p></details> |

| **[From eigenvector nonlinearities with quadratic structure to eigenvalue nonlinearities with algebraic structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16182v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decades, transformations between different classes of eigenvalue problems have played a central role in the development of numerical methods for eigenvalue computations. One of the most well-known and successful examples of this is the companion linearization for polynomial eigenvalue problems. In this paper, we construct a transformation that equivalently reframes a specific type of eigenvalue problem with eigenvector nonlinearities (NEPv) into an eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue nonlinearities (NEP). The NEPv class considered consists of nonlinearities expressed as sums of products of matrices and scalar functions, where the scalar functions depend nonlinearly on the eigenvector. Our transformation defines scalar eigenvalue nonlinearities through a polynomial system, resulting in NEP nonlinearities of algebraic type. We propose methods to solve the polynomial system, one of which involves a multiparameter eigenvalue problem (MEP). We adapt well-established NEP solvers to this setting, with the most effective strategy being a combination of deflation and a locally quadratically convergent iterative method. The efficiency and properties of the approach are illustrated by solving a problem related to a modification of a Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). The simulations are reproducible and publicly available.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[An Unsupervised Natural Language Processing Pipeline for Assessing Referral Appropriateness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14701v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Assessing the appropriateness of diagnostic referrals is critical for improving healthcare efficiency and reducing unnecessary procedures. However, this task becomes challenging when referral reasons are recorded only as free text rather than structured codes, like in the Italian NHS. To address this gap, we propose a fully unsupervised Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline capable of extracting and evaluating referral reasons without relying on labelled datasets. Methods: Our pipeline leverages Transformer-based embeddings pre-trained on Italian medical texts to cluster referral reasons and assess their alignment with appropriateness guidelines. It operates in an unsupervised setting and is designed to generalize across different examination types. We analyzed two complete regional datasets from the Lombardy Region (Italy), covering all referrals between 2019 and 2021 for venous echocolordoppler of the lower limbs (ECD;n=496,971; development) and flexible endoscope colonoscopy (FEC; n=407,949; testing only). For both, a random sample of 1,000 referrals was manually annotated to measure performance. Results: The pipeline achieved high performance in identifying referral reasons (Prec=92.43% (ECD), 93.59% (FEC); Rec=83.28% (ECD), 92.70% (FEC)) and appropriateness (Prec=93.58% (ECD), 94.66% (FEC); Rec=91.52% (ECD), 93.96% (FEC)). At the regional level, the analysis identified relevant inappropriate referral groups and variation across contexts, findings that informed a new Lombardy Region resolution to reinforce guideline adherence. Conclusions: This study presents a robust, scalable, unsupervised NLP pipeline for assessing referral appropriateness in large, real-world datasets. It demonstrates how such data can be effectively leveraged, providing public health authorities with a deployable AI tool to monitor practices and support evidence-based policy.</p></details> | 49 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Completing Spatial Transcriptomics Data for Gene Expression Prediction Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02980v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics is a groundbreaking technology that integrates histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on Spatial Transcriptomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2407.13027</p></details> |

State-of-the-art segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile (DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology, into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input, which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and Recall.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM, enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

In energy models, it depends on assumptions on the technical characteristics of the unit, such as its installed capacity or turbine technology. In this paper, we learn the empirical flexibility of gas units from their electricity generation, revealing how real-world limitations can lead to substantial differences between units with similar technical characteristics. Using a novel deep clustering approach, we transform 5 years (2019-2023) of unit-level hourly generation data for 49 German units from 100 MWp of installed capacity into low-dimensional embeddings. Our unsupervised approach identifies two clusters of peaker units (high flexibility) and two clusters of non-peaker units (low flexibility). The estimated ramp rates of non-peakers, which constitute half of the sample, display a low empirical flexibility, comparable to coal units. Non-peakers, predominantly owned by industry and municipal utilities, show limited response to low residual load and negative prices, generating on average 1.3 GWh during those hours. As the transition to renewables increases market variability, regulatory changes will be needed to unlock this flexibility potential.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately, developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF, enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at CDC2025</p></details> |

Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans.

If artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason, problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans, a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain, joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However, the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not silicon.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a book chapter in: Transformaci\'on Digital en la Educaci\'on: Innovaciones y Desaf\'ios desde los Campus Virtuales (UA Journals, 2024), pp. 11-14</p></details> |

Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Criti...</summary><p>Critical methodology flaws invalidate key results</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Generative Data Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation via Stronger Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06002v5)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data augmentation is crucial for pixel-wise annotation tasks like semantic segmentation, where labeling requires significant effort and intensive labor. Traditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and flips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions and fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue, generative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by generating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data augmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and visual references from the original image. However, these models face challenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content and structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective prompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data augmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion model. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using Class-Prompt Appending and Visual Prior Blending to enhance attention to labeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise number of augmented images while preserving the structure of segmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a class balancing algorithm to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and original images. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC datasets, our pipeline demonstrates its effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic images for semantic segmentation. Our code is available at https://github.com/chequanghuy/Enhanced-Generative-Data-Augmentation-for-Semantic-Segmentation-via-Stronger-Guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICPRAM 2025, ISBN 978-989-758-730-6, ISSN 2184-4313</p></details> |
| **[DaMoC: Efficiently Selecting the Optimal Large Language Model for Fine-tuning Domain Tasks Based on Data and Model Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01221v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods, and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible. Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while saving approximately 20-fold in training time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, we categorize these techniques into in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop. In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Accepted to ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[CP-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models for Constraint Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06052v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint Programming (CP) is widely used to solve combinatorial problems, but its core process, namely constraint modelling, requires significant expertise and is considered to be a bottleneck for wider adoption. Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform combinatorial problem descriptions into executable constraint models. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark that includes a diverse set of well-known combinatorial problems sourced from the CP community, structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax. Notably, the results show higher performance when modelling with a high-level Python-based framework. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods across different LLMs, which further increase accuracy, reaching up to 70% on this highly challenging benchmark.</p></details> | ECAI 25 |

In automated decision-making settings, this may lead to biased outcomes when models rely on cues that correlate with protected characteristics. We investigate whether prompting ChatGPT to rewrite text using simplification, neutralisation, localisation, and formalisation can reduce demographic signals while preserving meaning. Experimental results show a statistically significant drop in location classification accuracy across multiple models after transformation, suggesting reduced reliance on group-specific language. At the same time, sentiment analysis and rating prediction tasks confirm that the core meaning of the reviews remains greatly intact. These results suggest that prompt-based rewriting offers a practical and generalisable approach for mitigating bias in text classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects an error in the model specification</p></details> |

Instead of relying on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval.

We consider the challenging case of system identification under adversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is $\Theta(1/k)$ while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that the $\ell_1$-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix for nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to extend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially decays as $k$ grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows an exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to a similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output analysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, screening the vast sequence space for categorization of aggregate morphology remains intractable. We introduce PepMorph, an end-to-end peptide discovery pipeline that generates novel sequences that are not only prone to aggregate but self-assemble into a specified fibrillar or spherical morphology. We compiled a new dataset by leveraging existing aggregation propensity datasets and extracting geometric and physicochemical isolated peptide descriptors that act as proxies for aggregate morphology. This dataset is then used to train a Transformer-based Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a masking mechanism, which generates novel peptides under arbitrary conditioning. After filtering to ensure design specifications and validation of generated sequences through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, PepMorph yielded 83% accuracy in intended morphology generation, showcasing its promise as a framework for application-driven peptide discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Ophthalmology Science and is currently in press</p></details> |

However, each architecture presents specific challenges while realizing them on-device. Vision Transformers require positional embedding to maintain correspondence between the tokens processed by the transformer, although they offer the advantage of using fixed-size, reusable repetitive blocks following tokenization. The U-Net architecture lacks these attributes, as it utilizes variable-sized intermediate blocks for down-convolution and up-convolution in the noise estimation backbone for the diffusion process. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that utilizes a fixed-size, reusable transformer block as a core structure, making it more suitable for hardware implementation. Our architecture is characterized by low complexity, token-free design, absence of positional embeddings, uniformity, and scalability, making it highly suitable for deployment on mobile and resource-constrained devices. The proposed model exhibit competitive and consistent performance across both unconditional and conditional image generation tasks. The model achieved a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.6 on unconditional image generation with the CelebA.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at IJCNN 2025 poster track</p></details> |

Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on two of the datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

SPIN does not generate new information, and the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

However, current form factors heavily rely on VUI, which poses accessibility and usability issues; some latest ones are equipped with additional cameras and displays, which are costly and raise privacy concerns. These concerns jointly motivate Beyond-Voice, a novel high-fidelity acoustic sensing system that allows commodity home assistant devices to track and reconstruct hand poses continuously. It transforms the home assistant into an active sonar system using its existing onboard microphones and speakers. We feed a high-resolution range profile to the deep learning model that can analyze the motions of multiple body parts and predict the 3D positions of 21 finger joints, bringing the granularity for acoustic hand tracking to the next level. It operates across different environments and users without the need for personalized training data.

Though few-step distillation methods, particularly Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex 3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective: distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD), to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD) further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/Zanue/MDT-dist</p></details> |

However, structural properties of the system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these challenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics, loosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis. Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to significant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even leveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we show how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to construct a CBF for various new constraints. Throughout the paper, we provide examples illustrating the theoretical findings. Furthermore, a numerical study investigates the computational gains from invoking equivariances into the CBF synthesis.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, as sequence length increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention. Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Although surveillance cameras are installed around some buildings, it is challenging for humans to capture such events in surveillance videos due to the small size and fast motion of falling objects, as well as the complex background. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods to automatically detect falling objects around buildings in surveillance videos. To facilitate the investigation of falling object detection, we propose a large, diverse video dataset called FADE (FAlling Object DEtection around Buildings) for the first time. FADE contains 1,881 videos from 18 scenes, featuring 8 falling object categories, 4 weather conditions, and 4 video resolutions. Additionally, we develop a new object detection method called FADE-Net, which effectively leverages motion information and produces small-sized but high-quality proposals for detecting falling objects around buildings. Importantly, our method is extensively evaluated and analyzed by comparing it with the previous approaches used for generic object detection, video object detection, and moving object detection on the FADE dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed FADE-Net significantly outperforms other methods, providing an effective baseline for future research.

We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model, MiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning mode.

While they have been tackled mainly via handcrafted heuristics in the past, advances in neural networks have motivated the development of general methods to learn heuristics from data. Many approaches utilize a neural network to directly construct a solution, but are limited in further improving based on already constructed solutions at inference time. Our approach, Moco, defines a lightweight solution construction procedure, guided by a single continuous vector $\theta$ (called heatmap) and learns a neural network to update $\theta$ for a single instance of a COP at inference time. The update is based on various features of the current search state. The training procedure is budget aware, targeting the overall best solution found during the entire search. Moco is a fully learnable meta optimizer not utilizing problem specific heuristics or requiring optimal solutions for training. We test Moco on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and show that it significantly improves over other heatmap based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures.

| **[LADSG: Label-Anonymized Distillation and Similar Gradient Substitution for Label Privacy in Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06742v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training across distributed feature spaces, which enables privacy-preserving learning without sharing raw data. However, recent studies have confirmed the feasibility of label inference attacks by internal adversaries. By strategically exploiting gradient vectors and semantic embeddings, attackers-through passive, active, or direct attacks-can accurately reconstruct private labels, leading to catastrophic data leakage. Existing defenses, which typically address isolated leakage vectors or are designed for specific types of attacks, remain vulnerable to emerging hybrid attacks that exploit multiple pathways simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose Label-Anonymized Defense with Substitution Gradient (LADSG), a unified and lightweight defense framework for VFL. LADSG first anonymizes true labels via soft distillation to reduce semantic exposure, then generates semantically-aligned substitute gradients to disrupt gradient-based leakage, and finally filters anomalous updates through gradient norm detection. It is scalable and compatible with standard VFL pipelines. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets show that LADSG reduces the success rates of all three types of label inference attacks by 30-60% with minimal computational overhead, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Perturbation-Robust Predictive Modeling of Social Effects by Network Subspace Generalized Linear Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01163v5)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network-linked data, where multivariate observations are interconnected by a network, are becoming increasingly prevalent in fields such as sociology and biology. These data often exhibit inherent noise and complex relational structures, complicating conventional modeling and statistical inference. Motivated by empirical challenges in analyzing such data sets, this paper introduces a family of network subspace generalized linear models designed for analyzing noisy, network-linked data. We propose a model inference method based on subspace-constrained maximum likelihood, which emphasizes flexibility in capturing network effects and provides a robust inference framework against network perturbations. We establish the asymptotic distributions of the estimators under network perturbations, demonstrating the method's accuracy through extensive simulations involving random network models and deep-learning-based embedding algorithms. The proposed methodology is applied to a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale study on school conflicts, where it identifies significant social effects, offering meaningful and interpretable insights into student behaviors.</p></details> | 78 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Depth-Breadth Synergy in RLVR: Unlocking LLM Reasoning Gains with Adaptive Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13755v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions: Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews: MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[FFHFlow: Diverse and Uncertainty-Aware Dexterous Grasp Generation via Flow Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15161v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands from partial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/ffhflow/home/).</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally, whose ordering decided via coin-tossing.

| **[Uncertainty-Guided Likelihood Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03951v3)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree search is a fundamental tool for planning, as many sequential decision-making problems can be framed as searching over tree-structured spaces. We propose an uncertainty-guided tree search algorithm for settings where the reward function is a log-likelihood function of the paths. Due to the combinatorial explosion of the tree size, the set of paths for which one can obtain rewards is sparse, particularly when the likelihood is obtained through expensive evaluations, such as by querying a large language model. We address this challenge by deriving an probabilistic search heuristic based on regularity assumptions for the likelihood. Unlike existing tree search methods, the proposed method can perform backtracking and trade-off exploration with exploitation, and yet does not require expensive roll-outs, or sophisticated Bayesian inference. Through extensive on-model and off-model experiments on timely, large-scale practical applications, we demonstrate that our method identifies paths with high likelihood while requiring fewer costly evaluations.</p></details> | 10 pages |

As object detection models are often used in real-world contexts, such as robotics, where inference time is paramount, simply measuring models' accuracy is not enough to compare them. We thus compare a large variety of object detection models' accuracy and inference speed on multiple graphics cards. In addition to this large benchmarking attempt, we also reproduce the following models from scratch using PyTorch on the MS COCO 2017 dataset: DETR, RTMDet, ViTDet and YOLOv7. More importantly, we propose a unified training and evaluation pipeline, based on MMDetection's features, to better compare models. Our implementation of DETR and ViTDet could not achieve accuracy or speed performances comparable to what is declared in the original papers. On the other hand, reproduced RTMDet and YOLOv7 could match such performances. Studied papers are also found to be generally lacking for reproducibility purposes. As for MMDetection pretrained models, speed performances are severely reduced with limited computing resources (larger, more accurate models even more so). Moreover, results exhibit a strong trade-off between accuracy and speed, prevailed by anchor-free models - notably RTMDet or YOLOx models. The code used is this paper and all the experiments is available in the repository at https://github.com/willGuimont/segdet_mlcr2024.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are presented in alphabetical order, each having equal contribution to the work</p></details> |
| **[Learning an Efficient Multi-Turn Dialogue Evaluator from Multiple Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00454v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging task. Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-turn dialogue evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast and flexible dialogue quality assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 pages, under review</p></details> |

Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However, less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures, thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code will be released in: https://github.com/bytedance/NEVC.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, Accepted to ACMMM 2025</p></details> |
| **[CP-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models for Constraint Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06052v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint Programming (CP) is widely used to solve combinatorial problems, but its core process, namely constraint modelling, requires significant expertise and is considered to be a bottleneck for wider adoption. Aiming to alleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform combinatorial problem descriptions into executable constraint models. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint modelling are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific instances, which do not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark that includes a diverse set of well-known combinatorial problems sourced from the CP community, structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With this dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we compare and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct constraint modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying syntax. Notably, the results show higher performance when modelling with a high-level Python-based framework. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the use of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods across different LLMs, which further increase accuracy, reaching up to 70% on this highly challenging benchmark.</p></details> | ECAI 25 |
| **[Towards understanding Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flow -- Analysis of Generalized Bilinear Kernels for Gaussian target distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04008v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and non-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as in Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks. Different from other particle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the gradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to score-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient high-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce accelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric space of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a momentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of particles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we also include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the conference version \cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target distributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an optimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by analyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium. Interestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on the covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel functions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target distributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other popular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian neural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of log-likelihood and total iteration times.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 4 figures, 4 algorithms, 4 tables, comments welcome!</p></details> |
| **[The joint survival super learner: A super learner for right-censored data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17259v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk prediction models are widely used to guide real-world decision-making in areas such as healthcare and economics, and they also play a key role in estimating nuisance parameters in semiparametric inference. The super learner is a machine learning framework that combines a library of prediction algorithms into a meta-learner using cross-validated loss. In the context of right-censored data, careful consideration must be given to both the choice of loss function and the estimation of expected loss. Moreover, estimators such as inverse probability of censoring weighting require accurate modeling and an estimator of the censoring distribution. We propose a novel approach to super learning for survival analysis that jointly evaluates candidate learners for both the event-time distribution and the censoring distribution. Our method imposes no restrictions on the algorithms included in the library, accommodates competing risks, and does not rely on a single pre-specified estimator of the censoring distribution. We establish a finite-sample bound on the average price we pay for using cross-validation, and show that this price vanishes asymptotically, up to poly-logarithmic terms, provided that the size of the library does not grow faster than at a polynomial rate in the sample size. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method using prostate cancer data and compare it to existing super learner algorithms for survival analysis using synthesized data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Shortened and rewritten for clarity.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning framework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our design incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the Memory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples, and the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by integrating local and global features. This architecture enables dynamic adaptation from a few labeled samples without retraining the base model. Attn-Adapter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization, maintaining efficient inference and scaling across CLIP backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 - LIMIT Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Machine Intelligence on Wireless Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12210v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine intelligence on edge devices enables low-latency processing and improved privacy, but is often limited by the energy and delay of moving and converting data. Current systems frequently avoid local model storage by sending queries to a server, incurring uplink cost, network latency, and privacy risk. We present the opposite approach: broadcasting model weights to clients that perform inference locally using in-physics computation inside the radio receive chain. A base station transmits weights as radio frequency (RF) waveforms; the client encodes activations onto the waveform and computes the result using existing mixer and filter stages, RF components already present in billions of edge devices such as cellphones, eliminating repeated signal conversions and extra hardware. Analysis shows that thermal noise and nonlinearity create an optimal energy window for accurate analog inner products. Hardware-tailored training through a differentiable RF chain preserves accuracy within this regime. Circuit-informed simulations, consistent with a companion experiment, demonstrate reduced memory and conversion overhead while maintaining high accuracy in realistic wireless edge scenarios.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, video understanding remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5, which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity, processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution (Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment, incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github page: https://github.com/Kwai-Keye/Keye</p></details> |

Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods in MFGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2024</p></details> |

However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) -- reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based model predictive control methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication, 13 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool for doc-mt systems.</p></details> | under preview |

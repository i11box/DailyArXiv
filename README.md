| **[MME-Unify: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03641v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing MLLM benchmarks face significant challenges in evaluating Unified MLLMs (U-MLLMs) due to: 1) lack of standardized benchmarks for traditional tasks, leading to inconsistent comparisons; 2) absence of benchmarks for mixed-modality generation, which fails to assess multimodal reasoning capabilities. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to systematically assess U-MLLMs. Our benchmark includes: Standardized Traditional Task Evaluation. We sample from 12 datasets, covering 10 tasks with 30 subtasks, ensuring consistent and fair comparisons across studies." 2. Unified Task Assessment. We introduce five novel tasks testing multimodal reasoning, including image editing, commonsense QA with image generation, and geometric reasoning. 3. Comprehensive Model Benchmarking. We evaluate 12 leading U-MLLMs, such as Janus-Pro, EMU3, VILA-U, and Gemini2-flash, alongside specialized understanding (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet) and generation models (e.g., DALL-E-3). Our findings reveal substantial performance gaps in existing U-MLLMs, highlighting the need for more robust models capable of handling mixed-modality tasks effectively.

| **[Bonsai: Interpretable Tree-Adaptive Grounded Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03640v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To develop general-purpose collaborative agents, humans need reliable AI systems that can (1) adapt to new domains and (2) transparently reason with uncertainty to allow for verification and correction. Black-box models demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.</p></details> | 9 pages, preprint |
| **[Shape My Moves: Text-Driven Shape-Aware Synthesis of Human Motions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03639v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore how body shapes influence human motion synthesis, an aspect often overlooked in existing text-to-motion generation methods due to the ease of learning a homogenized, canonical body shape. However, this homogenization can distort the natural correlations between different body shapes and their motion dynamics. Our method addresses this gap by generating body-shape-aware human motions from natural language prompts. We utilize a finite scalar quantization-based variational autoencoder (FSQ-VAE) to quantize motion into discrete tokens and then leverage continuous body shape information to de-quantize these tokens back into continuous, detailed motion. Additionally, we harness the capabilities of a pretrained language model to predict both continuous shape parameters and motion tokens, facilitating the synthesis of text-aligned motions and decoding them into shape-aware motions. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively, and also conduct a comprehensive perceptual study to demonstrate its efficacy in generating shape-aware motions.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[AdaCM$^2$: On Understanding Extremely Long-Term Video with Adaptive Cross-Modality Memory Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12593v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled the improvement of video understanding tasks by incorporating LLMs with visual models. However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Highlight |
| **[Modeling Charging Demand and Quantifying Flexibility Bounds for Large-Scale BEV Fleets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03633v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a bottom-up method to model baseline charging power demand and quantify available flexibility for large-scale BEV fleets. The method utilizes geographic and sociodemographic information to represent the fleet's mobility and driving energy needs. It models the charging decisions of drivers based on their driving energy needs and range comfort level using real-world data. The flexibility quantification provides an hourly maximum and minimum bound for the charging power and limits the amount of daily flexible charging energy. We apply the methodology to the future fully electrified fleet of Switzerland as a case study and compare the spatio-temporal characteristics of the charging demand and flexibility of different geographic areas and urbanization levels.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Reciprocity-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Map-Based Path Loss Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03625v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path loss modeling is a widely used technique for estimating point-to-point losses along a communications link from transmitter (Tx) to receiver (Rx). Accurate path loss predictions can optimize use of the radio frequency spectrum and minimize unwanted interference. Modern path loss modeling often leverages data-driven approaches, using machine learning to train models on drive test measurement datasets. Drive tests primarily represent downlink scenarios, where the Tx is located on a building and the Rx is located on a moving vehicle. Consequently, trained models are frequently reserved for downlink coverage estimation, lacking representation of uplink scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that data augmentation can be used to train a path loss model that is generalized to uplink, downlink, and backhaul scenarios, training using only downlink drive test measurements. By adding a small number of synthetic samples representing uplink scenarios to the training set, root mean squared error is reduced by >8 dB on uplink examples in the test set.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Search with In-Place Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03620v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum query complexity is typically characterized in terms of XOR queries |x,y> to |x,y+f(x)> or phase queries, which ensure that even queries to non-invertible functions are unitary. When querying a permutation, another natural model is unitary: in-place queries |x> to |f(x)>. Some problems are known to require exponentially fewer in-place queries than XOR queries, but no separation has been shown in the opposite direction. A candidate for such a separation was the problem of inverting a permutation over N elements. This task, equivalent to unstructured search in the context of permutations, is solvable with $O(\sqrt{N})$ XOR queries but was conjectured to require $\Omega(N)$ in-place queries. We refute this conjecture by designing a quantum algorithm for Permutation Inversion using $O(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Our algorithm achieves the same speedup as Grover's algorithm despite the inability to efficiently uncompute queries or perform straightforward oracle-controlled reflections. Nonetheless, we show that there are indeed problems which require fewer XOR queries than in-place queries. We introduce a subspace-conversion problem called Function Erasure that requires 1 XOR query and $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ in-place queries. Then, we build on a recent extension of the quantum adversary method to characterize exact conditions for a decision problem to exhibit such a separation, and we propose a candidate problem.</p></details> | 31 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A New Statistical Approach to Calibration-Free Localization Using Unlabeled Crowdsourced Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03619v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fingerprinting-based indoor localization methods typically require labor-intensive site surveys to collect signal measurements at known reference locations and frequent recalibration, which limits their scalability. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel approach for indoor localization that utilizes crowdsourced data {\em without location labels}. We leverage the statistical information of crowdsourced data and propose a cumulative distribution function (CDF) based distance estimation method that maps received signal strength (RSS) to distances from access points. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional distance estimation based on the empirical path loss model by efficiently capturing the impacts of shadow fading and multipath. Compared to fingerprinting, our {\em unsupervised} statistical approach eliminates the need for signal measurements at known reference locations. The estimated distances are then integrated into a three-step framework to determine the target location. The localization performance of our proposed method is evaluated using RSS data generated from ray-tracing simulations. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in localization accuracy compared to methods based on the empirical path loss model. Furthermore, our statistical approach, which relies on unlabeled data, achieves localization accuracy comparable to that of the {\em supervised} approach, the $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) algorithm, which requires fingerprints with location labels. For reproducibility and future research, we make the ray-tracing dataset publicly available at [2].</p></details> | 15 pages |

The design of ranking mechanisms is critical to marketplace efficiency, as it influences both short-term revenue from promoted job placements and long-term health through sustained seeker engagement. Our analysis focuses on the tradeoff between revenue and relevance, as well as the innovations in job auction design. We demonstrated two ways to improve relevance with minimal impact on revenue: incorporating the seekers preferences and applying position-aware auctions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compu...</summary><p>Computational Jobs Marketplace, AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[AIR: A Systematic Analysis of Annotations, Instructions, and Response Pairs in Preference Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03612v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference learning is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet its success hinges on high-quality datasets comprising three core components: Preference \textbf{A}nnotations, \textbf{I}nstructions, and \textbf{R}esponse Pairs. Current approaches conflate these components, obscuring their individual impacts and hindering systematic optimization. In this work, we propose \textbf{AIR}, a component-wise analysis framework that systematically isolates and optimizes each component while evaluating their synergistic effects. Through rigorous experimentation, AIR reveals actionable principles: annotation simplicity (point-wise generative scoring), instruction inference stability (variance-based filtering across LLMs), and response pair quality (moderate margins + high absolute scores). When combined, these principles yield +5.3 average gains over baseline method, even with only 14k high-quality pairs. Our work shifts preference dataset design from ad hoc scaling to component-aware optimization, offering a blueprint for efficient, reproducible alignment.</p></details> | 29 pages, 11 figures |
| **[APIGen-MT: Agentic Pipeline for Multi-Turn Data Generation via Simulated Agent-Human Interplay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03601v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source both the synthetic data collected and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents. Models are available on HuggingFace at https://huggingface.co/collections/Salesforce/xlam-2-67ef5be12949d8dcdae354c4 and project website is https://apigen-mt.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages plus references and appendices</p></details> |
| **[MedSAM2: Segment Anything in 3D Medical Images and Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03600v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image and video segmentation is a critical task for precision medicine, which has witnessed considerable progress in developing task or modality-specific and generalist models for 2D images. However, there have been limited studies on building general-purpose models for 3D images and videos with comprehensive user studies. Here, we present MedSAM2, a promptable segmentation foundation model for 3D image and video segmentation. The model is developed by fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model 2 on a large medical dataset with over 455,000 3D image-mask pairs and 76,000 frames, outperforming previous models across a wide range of organs, lesions, and imaging modalities. Furthermore, we implement a human-in-the-loop pipeline to facilitate the creation of large-scale datasets resulting in, to the best of our knowledge, the most extensive user study to date, involving the annotation of 5,000 CT lesions, 3,984 liver MRI lesions, and 251,550 echocardiogram video frames, demonstrating that MedSAM2 can reduce manual costs by more than 85%. MedSAM2 is also integrated into widely used platforms with user-friendly interfaces for local and cloud deployment, making it a practical tool for supporting efficient, scalable, and high-quality segmentation in both research and healthcare environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://medsam2.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EnrichIndex: Using LLMs to Enrich Retrieval Indices Offline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03598v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing information retrieval systems excel in cases where the language of target documents closely matches that of the user query. However, real-world retrieval systems are often required to implicitly reason whether a document is relevant. For example, when retrieving technical texts or tables, their relevance to the user query may be implied through a particular jargon or structure, rather than explicitly expressed in their content. Large language models (LLMs) hold great potential in identifying such implied relevance by leveraging their reasoning skills. Nevertheless, current LLM-augmented retrieval is hindered by high latency and computation cost, as the LLM typically computes the query-document relevance online, for every query anew. To tackle this issue we introduce EnrichIndex, a retrieval approach which instead uses the LLM offline to build semantically-enriched retrieval indices, by performing a single pass over all documents in the retrieval corpus once during ingestion time. Furthermore, the semantically-enriched indices can complement existing online retrieval approaches, boosting the performance of LLM re-rankers. We evaluated EnrichIndex on five retrieval tasks, involving passages and tables, and found that it outperforms strong online LLM-based retrieval systems, with an average improvement of 11.7 points in recall @ 10 and 10.6 points in NDCG @ 10 compared to strong baselines. In terms of online calls to the LLM, it processes 293.3 times fewer tokens which greatly reduces the online latency and cost. Overall, EnrichIndex is an effective way to build better retrieval indices offline by leveraging the strong reasoning skills of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and code are available at https://peterbaile.github.io/enrichindex/</p></details> |
| **[Extending the SAREF4ENER Ontology with Flexibility Based on FlexOffers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03595v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key element to support the increased amounts of renewable energy in the energy system is flexibility, i.e., the possibility of changing energy loads in time and amount. Many flexibility models have been designed; however, exact models fail to scale for long time horizons or many devices. Because of this, the FlexOffer (FOs) model has been designed, to provide device-independent approximations of flexibility with good accuracy, and much better scaling for long time horizons and many devices. An important aspect of the real-life implementation of energy flexibility is enabling flexible data exchange with many types of smart energy appliances and market systems, e.g., in smart buildings. For this, ontologies standardizing data formats are required. However, the current industry standard ontology for integrating smart devices for energy purposes, SAREF for Energy Flexibility (SAREF4ENER) only has limited support for flexibility and thus cannot support important use cases. In this paper we propose an extension of SAREF4ENER that integrates full support for the complete FlexOffer model, including advanced use cases, while maintaining backward compatibility. This novel ontology module can accurately describe flexibility for advanced devices such as electric vehicles, batteries, and heat pumps. It can also capture the inherent uncertainty associated with many flexible load types.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

| **[A Lower Bound on Conservative Elementary Object Systems Coverability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03591v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elementary Object Systems (EOS) are a form of Petri Net (PN) where tokens carry internal PN. This model has been recently proposed for analysis of robustness of Multi Agent Systems. While EOS reachability is known to be undecidable, the decidability of coverability of its conservative fragment (where the type of internal PN cannot be completely deleted and, thus, is conserved) was proved a decade ago, no study charted its complexity. Here, we take a first step in this direction, by showing how to encode $\nu$PNs, a well studied form of PN enriched with data, into conservative EOS (cEOS). This yields a non-Primitive Recursive, $F_{\omega2}$ lower-bound on cEOS coverability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, part of a submission to a journal</p></details> |
| **[AutoSSVH: Exploring Automated Frame Sampling for Efficient Self-Supervised Video Hashing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03587v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Video Hashing (SSVH) compresses videos into hash codes for efficient indexing and retrieval using unlabeled training videos. Existing approaches rely on random frame sampling to learn video features and treat all frames equally. This results in suboptimal hash codes, as it ignores frame-specific information density and reconstruction difficulty. To address this limitation, we propose a new framework, termed AutoSSVH, that employs adversarial frame sampling with hash-based contrastive learning. Our adversarial sampling strategy automatically identifies and selects challenging frames with richer information for reconstruction, enhancing encoding capability. Additionally, we introduce a hash component voting strategy and a point-to-set (P2Set) hash-based contrastive objective, which help capture complex inter-video semantic relationships in the Hamming space and improve the discriminability of learned hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoSSVH achieves superior retrieval efficacy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Hallucination Detection on a Budget: Efficient Bayesian Estimation of Semantic Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03579v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting whether an LLM hallucinates is an important research challenge. One promising way of doing so is to estimate the semantic entropy (Farquhar et al., 2024) of the distribution of generated sequences. We propose a new algorithm for doing that, with two main advantages. First, due to us taking the Bayesian approach, we achieve a much better quality of semantic entropy estimates for a given budget of samples from the LLM. Second, we are able to tune the number of samples adaptively so that `harder' contexts receive more samples. We demonstrate empirically that our approach systematically beats the baselines, requiring only 59% of samples used by Farquhar et al. (2024) to achieve the same quality of hallucination detection as measured by AUROC. Moreover, quite counterintuitively, our estimator is useful even with just one sample from the LLM.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for Interpretable Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03745v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several deep learning (DL) approaches have been proposed to deal with image classification tasks. However, despite their effectiveness, they lack interpretability, as they are unable to explain or justify their results. To address the challenge of interpretable image classification, this paper introduces a novel framework, named Interpretable Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (I2FCMs).Intuitionistic FCMs (iFCMs) have been proposed as an extension of FCMs offering a natural mechanism to assess the quality of their output through the estimation of hesitancy, a concept resembling human hesitation in decision making. In the context of image classification, hesitancy is considered as a degree of unconfidence with which an image is categorized to a class. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time iFCMs are applied for image classification. Further novel contributions of the introduced framework include the following: a) a feature extraction process focusing on the most informative image regions; b) a learning algorithm for automatic data-driven determination of the intuitionistic fuzzy interconnections of the iFCM, thereby reducing human intervention in the definition of the graph structure; c) an inherently interpretable classification approach based on image contents, providing understandable explanations of its predictions, using linguistic terms. Furthermore, the proposed I2FCM framework can be applied to DL models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), rendering them interpretable. The effectiveness of I2FCM is evaluated on publicly available datasets, and the results confirm that it can provide enhanced classification performance, while providing interpretable inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> |
| **[PF3Det: A Prompted Foundation Feature Assisted Visual LiDAR 3D Detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03563v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection is crucial for autonomous driving, leveraging both LiDAR point clouds for precise depth information and camera images for rich semantic information. Therefore, the multi-modal methods that combine both modalities offer more robust detection results. However, efficiently fusing LiDAR points and images remains challenging due to the domain gaps. In addition, the performance of many models is limited by the amount of high quality labeled data, which is expensive to create. The recent advances in foundation models, which use large-scale pre-training on different modalities, enable better multi-modal fusion. Combining the prompt engineering techniques for efficient training, we propose the Prompted Foundational 3D Detector (PF3Det), which integrates foundation model encoders and soft prompts to enhance LiDAR-camera feature fusion. PF3Det achieves the state-of-the-art results under limited training data, improving NDS by 1.19% and mAP by 2.42% on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrating its efficiency in 3D detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to the CVPR 2025 Workshop on Distillation of Foundation Models for Autonomous Driving (WDFM-AD)</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Knowledge Distillation Using Partial Information Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07483v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation deploys complex machine learning models in resource-constrained environments by training a smaller student model to emulate internal representations of a complex teacher model. However, the teacher's representations can also encode nuisance or additional information not relevant to the downstream task. Distilling such irrelevant information can actually impede the performance of a capacity-limited student model. This observation motivates our primary question: What are the information-theoretic limits of knowledge distillation? To this end, we leverage Partial Information Decomposition to quantify and explain the transferred knowledge and knowledge left to distill for a downstream task. We theoretically demonstrate that the task-relevant transferred knowledge is succinctly captured by the measure of redundant information about the task between the teacher and student. We propose a novel multi-level optimization to incorporate redundant information as a regularizer, leading to our framework of Redundant Information Distillation (RID). RID leads to more resilient and effective distillation under nuisance teachers as it succinctly quantifies task-relevant knowledge rather than simply aligning student and teacher representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive functional principal components analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16091v4)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional data analysis almost always involves smoothing discrete observations into curves, because they are never observed in continuous time and rarely without error. Although smoothing parameters affect the subsequent inference, data-driven methods for selecting these parameters are not well-developed, frustrated by the difficulty of using all the information shared by curves while being computationally efficient. On the one hand, smoothing individual curves in an isolated, albeit sophisticated way, ignores useful signals present in other curves. On the other hand, bandwidth selection by automatic procedures such as cross-validation after pooling all the curves together quickly become computationally unfeasible due to the large number of data points. In this paper we propose a new data-driven, adaptive kernel smoothing, specifically tailored for functional principal components analysis through the derivation of sharp, explicit risk bounds for the eigen-elements. The minimization of these quadratic risk bounds provide refined, yet computationally efficient bandwidth rules for each eigen-element separately. Both common and independent design cases are allowed. Rates of convergence for the estimators are derived. An extensive simulation study, designed in a versatile manner to closely mimic the characteristics of real data sets supports our methodological contribution. An illustration on a real data application is provided.</p></details> | Final version |
| **[Agentic Knowledgeable Self-awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03553v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved considerable performance across various agentic planning tasks. However, traditional agent planning approaches adopt a "flood irrigation" methodology that indiscriminately injects gold trajectories, external feedback, and domain knowledge into agent models. This practice overlooks the fundamental human cognitive principle of situational self-awareness during decision-making-the ability to dynamically assess situational demands and strategically employ resources during decision-making. We propose agentic knowledgeable self-awareness to address this gap, a novel paradigm enabling LLM-based agents to autonomously regulate knowledge utilization. Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs. Our experiments demonstrate that KnowSelf can outperform various strong baselines on different tasks and models with minimal use of external knowledge.

Specifically, our work explores to provide a general representation to boost the temporal matching ability in various downstream tracking tasks. To achieve this, we firstly find that a simple extension of MAE, which randomly masks out frame patches in videos and reconstruct the frame pixels, heavily relies on spatial cues while ignoring temporal relations for frame reconstruction, thus leading to sub-optimal temporal matching representations. To alleviate this, we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the frame reconstruction to facilitate temporal correspondence learning in videos. We obtain several important findings with DropMAE: 1) DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner, which achieves better fine-tuning results on matching-based tasks than the ImageNet-based MAE with 2x faster pre-training speed. 2) DropMAE is effective for different tracking tasks, i.e., object-level matching tasks including VOT and VOS, dense tracking tasks including optical flow estimation and tracking any point (TAP), and even 3D tracking in the different modality of point cloud data. Since none exists, we build ViT-based trackers for different downstream tracking tasks, and our pre-trained DropMAE model can be directly loaded in these ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning without further modifications. Experiments on 6 downstream tracking tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of DropMAE as a general pre-trained representation for diverse tracking tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of DropMAE for 6 temporal matching-based downstream tasks</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting MAE pre-training for 3D medical image segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23132v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) presents an exciting opportunity to unlock the potential of vast, untapped clinical datasets, for various downstream applications that suffer from the scarcity of labeled data. While SSL has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by three key pitfalls: Small pre-training dataset sizes, architectures inadequate for 3D medical image analysis, and insufficient evaluation practices. In this paper, we address these issues by i) leveraging a large-scale dataset of 39k 3D brain MRI volumes and ii) using a Residual Encoder U-Net architecture within the state-of-the-art nnU-Net framework. iii) A robust development framework, incorporating 5 development and 8 testing brain MRI segmentation datasets, allowed performance-driven design decisions to optimize the simple concept of Masked Auto Encoders (MAEs) for 3D CNNs. The resulting model not only surpasses previous SSL methods but also outperforms the strong nnU-Net baseline by an average of approximately 3 Dice points setting a new state-of-the-art.

| **[AutoML Benchmark with shorter time constraints and early stopping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01222v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) automatically builds machine learning (ML) models on data. The de facto standard for evaluating new AutoML frameworks for tabular data is the AutoML Benchmark (AMLB). AMLB proposed to evaluate AutoML frameworks using 1- and 4-hour time budgets across 104 tasks. We argue that shorter time constraints should be considered for the benchmark because of their practical value, such as when models need to be retrained with high frequency, and to make AMLB more accessible. This work considers two ways in which to reduce the overall computation used in the benchmark: smaller time constraints and the use of early stopping. We conduct evaluations of 11 AutoML frameworks on 104 tasks with different time constraints and find the relative ranking of AutoML frameworks is fairly consistent across time constraints, but that using early-stopping leads to a greater variety in model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on the Future of Machine Learning Data Practices and Repositories, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

The paper deals with general binary sources where the distribution of any symbol (0 or 1) may depend on an unbounded part of the previous history. The paper studies Shannon weights: whereas the classical Shannon entropy ${\cal E}_{\mu}$ is the average amount of information brought by one symbol of the emitted word, the Shannon weight sequence deals with the average amount of information $m_{\mu}(n)$ that is brought by the emitted prefix of length $n$. For a source with a non zero entropy, the estimate $m_{\mu}(n)\sim{\cal E}_{\mu} \cdot n$ thus holds. The paper considers the model of dynamical sources, where a source word isemitted as an encoded trajectory of a dynamical system of the unit interval, when endowed with probability $\mu$. It focus on sources with zero entropy and gives explicit constructions for sources whose Shannon weight sequence satisfies $m_{\mu}(n)=o(n)$, with a prescribed behaviour. In this case, sources with zero entropy lead to dynamical systems built on maps with an indifferent fixed point. This class notably contains the celebrated Farey source, which presents well-known intermittency phenomena. Methods are based on analytic combinatorics and generating functions, and they are enlarged, in the present dynamical case, with dynamical systems tools (mainly transfer operators).</p></details> | 51 pages, 3 figures |

Current approaches rely on generative models to synthesize multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction and animation. However, directly generating multiple views from a single human image suffers from geometric inconsistencies, resulting in issues like fragmented or blurred limbs in the reconstructed models. To tackle these limitations, we introduce \textbf{HumanDreamer-X}, a novel framework that integrates multi-view human generation and reconstruction into a unified pipeline, which significantly enhances the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models. In this framework, 3D Gaussian Splatting serves as an explicit 3D representation to provide initial geometry and appearance priority. Building upon this foundation, \textbf{HumanFixer} is trained to restore 3DGS renderings, which guarantee photorealistic results. Furthermore, we delve into the inherent challenges associated with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, and propose an attention modulation strategy that effectively enhances geometric details identity consistency across multi-view. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach markedly improves generation and reconstruction PSNR quality metrics by 16.45% and 12.65%, respectively, achieving a PSNR of up to 25.62 dB, while also showing generalization capabilities on in-the-wild data and applicability to various human reconstruction backbone models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://humandreamer-x.github.io/</p></details> |

This method uses a conservative extension of $ZF$ known as $ZF_{\varepsilon}$, where two membership relations co-exist, the usual one denoted $\in$ and a stricter one denoted $\varepsilon$ that does not satisfy the axiom of extensionality; accordingly we have two equality relations, the extensional one $\simeq$ and the strict identity $=$ referring to sets that satisfy the same formulas. We define recursive names using an operator that we call reish, and we show that the class of recursive names for ordinals coincides extensionally with the class of ordinals of realizability models. We show that reish$(\omega)$ is extensionally equal to omega in any realizability model, thus recursive names provide a useful tool for computing $\omega$ in realizability models. We show that on the contrary $\varepsilon$-totally ordered sets do not form a proper class and therefore cannot be used to fully represent the ordinals in realizability models. Finally we present some tools for preserving cardinals in realizability models, including an analogue for realizability algebras of the forcing property known as the $\kappa$-chain condition.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Within the context of GF-RA, this study investigates the efficiency of employing supervised machine learning techniques to tackle the challenges on the device activity detection (AD). GF-RA addresses scalability by employing non-orthogonal pilot sequences, which provides an efficient alternative comparing to conventional grant-based random access (GB-RA) technique that are constrained by the scarcity of orthogonal preamble resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight data-driven algorithmic framework specifically designed for activity detection in GF-RA for mMTC in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. We propose two distinct framework deployment strategies, centralized and decentralized, both tailored to streamline the proposed approach implementation across network infrastructures. Moreover, we introduce optimized post-detection methodologies complemented by a clustering stage to enhance overall detection performances. Our 3GPP-compliant simulations have validated that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art model-based activity detection accuracy while significantly reducing complexity. Achieving 99% accuracy, it demonstrates real-world viability and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.07160</p></details> |

However, most existing LLM-based models (e.g., VideoLLaMA, VideoChat) are constrained to processing short-duration videos. Recent attempts to understand long-term videos by extracting and compressing visual features into a fixed memory size. Nevertheless, those methods leverage only visual modality to merge video tokens and overlook the correlation between visual and textual queries, leading to difficulties in effectively handling complex question-answering tasks. To address the challenges of long videos and complex prompts, we propose AdaCM$^2$, which, for the first time, introduces an adaptive cross-modality memory reduction approach to video-text alignment in an auto-regressive manner on video streams. Our extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as video captioning, video question answering, and video classification, demonstrate that AdaCM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while significantly reducing memory usage. Notably, it achieves a 4.5% improvement across multiple tasks in the LVU dataset with a GPU memory consumption reduction of up to 65%.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 Highlight |

We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source both the synthetic data collected and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

Existing approaches rely on random frame sampling to learn video features and treat all frames equally. This results in suboptimal hash codes, as it ignores frame-specific information density and reconstruction difficulty. To address this limitation, we propose a new framework, termed AutoSSVH, that employs adversarial frame sampling with hash-based contrastive learning. Our adversarial sampling strategy automatically identifies and selects challenging frames with richer information for reconstruction, enhancing encoding capability. Additionally, we introduce a hash component voting strategy and a point-to-set (P2Set) hash-based contrastive objective, which help capture complex inter-video semantic relationships in the Hamming space and improve the discriminability of learned hash codes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoSSVH achieves superior retrieval efficacy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Yet to understand the future of work, we need to know more about what people actually do in their jobs, going beyond educational credentials or job descriptions. Here we analyze work in the global software industry using tens of millions of Question and Answer posts on Stack Overflow to create a fine-grained taxonomy of software tasks, the elementary building blocks of software development work. These tasks predict salaries and job requirements in real-world job ads. We also observe how individuals learn within tasks and diversify into new tasks. Tasks that people acquire tend to be related to their old ones, but of lower value, suggesting that they are easier. An exception is users of Python, an increasingly popular programming language known for its versatility. Python users enter tasks that tend to be higher-value, providing an explanation for the language's growing popularity based on the tasks Python enables its users to perform. In general, these insights demonstrate the value of task taxonomies extracted at scale from large datasets: they offer high resolution and near real-time descriptions of changing labor markets. In the case of software tasks, they map such changes for jobs at the forefront of a digitizing global economy.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |
| **[PHOENIX: Pauli-Based High-Level Optimization Engine for Instruction Execution on NISQ Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03529v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational quantum algorithms (VQA) based on Hamiltonian simulation represent a specialized class of quantum programs well-suited for near-term quantum computing applications due to its modest resource requirements in terms of qubits and circuit depth. Unlike the conventional single-qubit (1Q) and two-qubit (2Q) gate sequence representation, Hamiltonian simulation programs are essentially composed of disciplined subroutines known as Pauli exponentiations (Pauli strings with coefficients) that are variably arranged. To capitalize on these distinct program features, this study introduces PHOENIX, a highly effective compilation framework that primarily operates at the high-level Pauli-based intermediate representation (IR) for generic Hamiltonian simulation programs. PHOENIX exploits global program optimization opportunities to the greatest extent, compared to existing SOTA methods despite some of them also utilizing similar IRs. PHOENIX employs the binary symplectic form (BSF) to formally describe Pauli strings and reformulates IR synthesis as reducing the column weights of BSF by appropriate Clifford transformations. It comes with a heuristic BSF simplification algorithm that searches for the most appropriate 2Q Clifford operators in sequence to maximally simplify the BSF at each step, until the BSF can be directly synthesized by basic 1Q and 2Q gates. PHOENIX further performs a global ordering strategy in a Tetris-like fashion for these simplified IR groups, carefully balancing optimization opportunities for gate cancellation, minimizing circuit depth, and managing qubit routing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that PHOENIX outperforms SOTA VQA compilers across diverse program categories, backend ISAs, and hardware topologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures; To be published as a conference paper at DAC 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any U-Net-based architecture.

Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Semi-Supervised Model-Free Bayesian State Estimation from Compressed Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07368v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider data-driven Bayesian state estimation from compressed measurements (BSCM) of a model-free process. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than that of the temporal state vector to be estimated, leading to an under-determined inverse problem. The underlying dynamical model of the state's evolution is unknown for a 'model-free process.' Hence, it is difficult to use traditional model-driven methods, for example, Kalman and particle filters. Instead, we consider data-driven methods. We experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem in a model-free process. The methods are -- data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) and deep Markov model (DMM). While DANSE provides good predictive/forecasting performance to model the temporal measurement data as a time series, its unsupervised learning lacks suitable regularization for tackling the BSCM task. We then propose a semi-supervised learning approach and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In SemiDANSE, we use a large amount of unlabelled data along with a limited amount of labelled data, i.e., pairwise measurement-and-state data, which provides the desired regularization. Using three benchmark dynamical systems, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive state estimation performance for BSCM against a hybrid method called KalmanNet and two model-driven methods (extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter) that know the dynamical models exactly.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, under review at IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 WDFM-AD |

However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a persistent challenge, particularly in the presence of significant domain shifts across tasks. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. The orthogonal LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in an orthogonal subspace of previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while the residual LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in the residual subspace spanned by task-specific bases without interaction across tasks, offering complementary capabilities for fine-tuning new tasks. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and memory efficiency over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a major deduction error in Section 4.1 of the paper, and the relevant results in Table 1 and Table 2 need to be corrected</p></details> |

The formula allows for estimation of the Stieltjes transform of the population spectral distribution $s_H(z)$, when $z$ is sufficiently far from the support of the population spectral distribution $H$. If the dimension $d$ and the sample size $n$ go to infinity simultaneously such that $\frac{d}{n} \rightarrow c>0$, the estimation error is shown to be asymptotically less than $\frac{n^{\varepsilon}}{n}$ for arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$. By integrating along a curve around the support of $H$, estimators for population linear spectral statistics are constructed, which benefit from this convergence speed of $\frac{n^{\varepsilon}}{n}$.</p></details> | 34 pages, 2 figures |

A dual-functional base station conducts downlink data transmission services based on RSMA for multiple users, while sensing surrounding multiple targets. To enable effective multicast communications and ensure fair and balanced multi-target sensing and under a constrained power budget, we propose a multi-target sensing enhancement scheme incorporating fairness-aware BF, common rate splitting, and sensing power allocation. The proposed scheme minimizes the sensing CRB, while maximizing communication rate demands. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for both sensing CRB and communication rates. Building upon them, we formulate an optimization problem aiming to minimize the sensing CRB, while maximizing the communication rates. Considering the non-convex nature of the original optimization problem poses significant computational challenges, we transform the tradeoff optimization into a Pareto-optimal problem by employing Taylor series expansion, semi-definite relaxation, successive convex approximation, and penalty function to transform the non-convex problem and associated constraints into tractable forms. Extensive simulations validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed RSMA-based fairness-aware BF over non-orthogonal multiple access, space division multiple access, and orthogonal multiple access, through comprehensive comparisons in two key aspects: CRB performance improvement and sensing-communication tradeoff characteristics. The proposed optimization framework exhibits remarkable superiority in enhancing both sensing accuracy and communication quality for ISAC systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 17 figures, journal article</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to directly estimate the contribution of data during pretraining and select pretraining data in an efficient manner. Specifically, we draw inspiration from recent findings showing that compression efficiency (i.e., the normalized loss) of diverse models on certain text correlates strongly with their downstream performance, when the text domain aligns with the downstream benchmarks(Huang et al., 2024). Building on this observation, we hypothesize that data on which model losses are predictive of downstream abilities also contribute effectively to learning. To leverage this insight, we introduce predictive data selection (PreSelect), a lightweight and efficient data selection method that requires training and deploying only a fastText-based scorer. Through comprehensive experiments with 1B and 3B parameter models, we demonstrate that models trained on 30B tokens selected with PreSelect surpass the performance of the vanilla baseline trained on 300B tokens, achieving a 10x reduction in compute requirements. Furthermore, PreSelect significantly outperforms other competitive data selection baselines, such as DCLM and FineWeb-Edu on a scale of 3B models trained on 100B tokens. We open-source our trained data selection scorer along with the curated datasets at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/PreSelect.</p></details> | 22 pages |

However, the field faces challenges such as limited large-scale datasets and high data acquisition costs, which hinder the development of robust algorithms. Data augmentation techniques show promise in addressing these issues, but their application to biomechanical time-series data requires comprehensive evaluation. This scoping review investigates data augmentation methods for time-series data in the biomechanics domain. It analyzes current approaches for augmenting and generating time-series datasets, evaluates their effectiveness, and offers recommendations for applying these techniques in biomechanics. Four databases, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, were searched for studies published between 2013 and 2024. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a two-stage screening identified 21 relevant publications. Results show that there is no universally preferred method for augmenting biomechanical time-series data; instead, methods vary based on study objectives. A major issue identified is the absence of soft tissue artifacts in synthetic data, leading to discrepancies referred to as the synthetic gap. Moreover, many studies lack proper evaluation of augmentation methods, making it difficult to assess their effects on model performance and data quality. This review highlights the critical role of data augmentation in addressing limited dataset availability and improving model generalization in biomechanics. Tailoring augmentation strategies to the characteristics of biomechanical data is essential for advancing predictive modeling. A better understanding of how different augmentation methods impact data quality and downstream tasks will be key to developing more effective and realistic techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review at PLOS ONE</p></details> |

However, by treating entire networks as flat parameter vectors, it overlooks key structural information and is susceptible to task interference. In this paper, we study task vectors at the layer level, focusing on task layer matrices and their singular value decomposition. In particular, we concentrate on the resulting singular vectors, which we refer to as Task Singular Vectors (TSV). Recognizing that layer task matrices are often low-rank, we propose TSV-Compress (TSV-C), a simple procedure that compresses them to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. We further leverage this low-rank space to define a new measure of task interference based on the interaction of singular vectors from different tasks. Building on these findings, we introduce TSV-Merge (TSV-M), a novel model merging approach that combines compression with interference reduction, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition 2025 (CVPR)</p></details> |

Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |

Within the realm of music recommendation, graphs play a crucial role in enhancing genre-based recommendations by integrating Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with advanced graph embeddings. This study explores the efficacy of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Transformer (GT) models in learning embeddings that effectively capture intricate relationships between music items and genres represented within graph structures. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world music datasets, our findings consistently demonstrate that these graph-based approaches outperform traditional methods that rely solely on MFCC features or collaborative filtering techniques. Specifically, the graph-enhanced models achieve notably higher accuracy in predicting genre-specific preferences and offering relevant music suggestions to users. These results underscore the effectiveness of utilizing graph embeddings to enrich feature representations and exploit latent associations within music data, thereby illustrating their potential to advance the capabilities of personalized and context-aware music recommendation systems.

In the algorithm, the derived optimal probability measure is based on the criterion of minimizing the variance of the importance sampling estimator within a parametric exponential tilting family. Since the copula model is defined by its marginals and a copula function, and its moment-generating function is difficult to derive, we apply the transform likelihood ratio method to first identify an alternative exponential tilting family, after which we obtain simple and explicit expressions of equations. Then, the optimal alternative probability measure can be calculated under this transformed exponential tilting family. The proposed importance sampling framework is quite general and can be implemented for many classes of copula models, including some traditional parametric copula families and a class of semiparametric copulas called regular vine copulas, from which sampling is feasible. The theoretical results of the logarithmic efficiency and bounded relative error are proved for some commonly-used copula models under the case of simple rare events. Monte Carlo experiments are conducted, in which we study the relative efficiency of the crude Monte Carlo estimator with respect to the proposed importance-sampling-based estimators, such that substantial variance reductions are obtained in comparison to the standard Monte Carlo estimators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SCIENTIA SINICA Mathematica (in Chinese)</p></details> |

We introduce two core concepts: the Tensor Net function and the characteristic time property of neural learning. First, we reinterpret the learning rate as a time step in a continuous system. This transforms neural learning from discrete optimization into continuous-time evolution. We show that learning dynamics remain consistent when the product of learning rate and iteration steps stays constant. This reveals a time-invariant behavior and identifies an intrinsic timescale of the network. Second, we define the Tensor Net function as a measure that captures the relationship between decision probabilities, entropy gradients, and knowledge change. Additionally, we define its zero-crossing as the equilibrium state between decision probabilities and entropy gradients. We show that the convergence of entropy and knowledge flow provides a natural stopping condition, replacing arbitrary thresholds with an information-theoretic criterion. We also establish that SKA dynamics satisfy a variational principle based on the Euler-Lagrange equation. These findings extend SKA into a continuous and self-organizing learning model. The framework links computational learning with physical systems that evolve by natural laws. By understanding learning as a time-based process, we open new directions for building efficient, robust, and biologically-inspired AI systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Unlike previous methods that require extensive training on captured video sequences or rely on auxiliary neural networks for animation and rendering during inference, our approach generates Gaussian heads that are immediately animatable and renderable. Specifically, LAM creates an animatable Gaussian head in a single forward pass, enabling reenactment and rendering without additional networks or post-processing steps. This capability allows for seamless integration into existing rendering pipelines, ensuring real-time animation and rendering across a wide range of platforms, including mobile phones. The centerpiece of our framework is the canonical Gaussian attributes generator, which utilizes FLAME canonical points as queries. These points interact with multi-scale image features through a Transformer to accurately predict Gaussian attributes in the canonical space. The reconstructed canonical Gaussian avatar can then be animated utilizing standard linear blend skinning (LBS) with corrective blendshapes as the FLAME model did and rendered in real-time on various platforms. Our experimental results demonstrate that LAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on existing benchmarks.

To formalize a suitable notion of equivalence in this setting, we introduce the concept of database transformers, which transform database instances between graph and relational models. We then propose a novel verification methodology that checks equivalence modulo a given transformer by reducing the original problem to verifying equivalence between a pair of SQL queries. This reduction is achieved by embedding a subset of Cypher into SQL through syntax-directed translation, allowing us to leverage existing research on automated reasoning for SQL while obviating the need for reasoning simultaneously over two different data models. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Graphiti and used it to check equivalence between graph and relational queries. Our experiments demonstrate that Graphiti is useful both for verification and refutation and that it can uncover subtle bugs, including those found in Cypher tutorials and academic papers.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 23 figures, 5 tables, PLDI 2025</p></details> |

Using the BridgeData V2 dataset, we generate fine-tuned image captions with a pretrained BLIP-2 vision-language model and combine them with visual features through an early fusion strategy. The fused representations are processed using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal agents achieve a 20% improvement in task completion rates and significantly outperform visual-only and textual-only baselines after sufficient training. Compared to transformer-based and recurrent multimodal RL models, our approach achieves superior performance in cumulative reward and caption quality metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE-L). These results highlight the impact of semantically aligned language cues in enhancing agent learning efficiency and generalization.

Recently, deep learning has shown great potential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled measurements. However, one needs to train multiple models for different undersampling patterns and desired output image resolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such approaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling patterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different real-time imaging and diagnostic requirements. We propose a unified MRI reconstruction model robust to various measurement undersampling patterns and image resolutions. Our approach uses neural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture applied in both image and measurement spaces, to capture local and global features. Empirically, our model improves SSIM by 11% and PSNR by 4 dB over a state-of-the-art CNN (End-to-End VarNet), with 600$\times$ faster inference than diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enables zero-shot super-resolution and extended field-of-view reconstruction, offering a versatile and efficient solution for clinical MR imaging. Our unified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to various measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly effective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging.

However, delays in knowledge updates may cause them to reason incorrectly or produce harmful results. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide rich and reliable contextual information for the reasoning process of LLMs by structurally organizing and connecting a wide range of entities and relations. Existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods only inject KGs' knowledge into prompts in a textual form, ignoring its structural information. Moreover, they mostly rely on close-source models or open-source models with large parameters, which poses challenges to high resource consumption. To address this, we propose a novel Lightweight and efficient Prompt learning-ReasOning Framework for KGQA (LightPROF), which leverages the full potential of LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, LightPROF follows a "Retrieve-Embed-Reason process", first accurately, and stably retrieving the corresponding reasoning graph from the KG through retrieval module. Next, through a Transformer-based Knowledge Adapter, it finely extracts and integrates factual and structural information from the KG, then maps this information to the LLM's token embedding space, creating an LLM-friendly prompt to be used by the LLM for the final reasoning. Additionally, LightPROF only requires training Knowledge Adapter and can be compatible with any open-source LLM. Extensive experiments on two public KGQA benchmarks demonstrate that LightPROF achieves superior performance with small-scale LLMs. Furthermore, LightPROF shows significant advantages in terms of input token count and reasoning time.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

A vital issue is that ViTs pre-trained to cover a broad range of tasks are \textit{over-qualified} for edge devices that usually demand only part of a ViT's knowledge for specific tasks. Their task-specific accuracy on these edge devices is suboptimal. We discovered that small ViTs that focus on device-specific tasks can improve model accuracy and in the meantime, accelerate model inference. This paper presents NuWa, an approach that derives small ViTs from the base ViT for edge devices with specific task requirements. NuWa can transfer task-specific knowledge extracted from the base ViT into small ViTs that fully leverage constrained resources on edge devices to maximize model accuracy with inference latency assurance. Experiments with three base ViTs on three public datasets demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art solutions, NuWa improves model accuracy by up to $\text{11.83}\%$ and accelerates model inference by 1.29$\times$ - 2.79$\times$.

Specifically, they can be trained online to efficiently sample diverse candidates near the Pareto front. A key advantage of OP GFlowNets is their ability to impose a local order on training samples based on Pareto dominance, eliminating the need for scalarization - a common requirement in other approaches like Preference-Conditional GFlowNets. However, we identify an important limitation of OP GFlowNets: imposing a local order on training samples can lead to conflicting optimization objectives. To address this issue, we introduce Global-Order GFlowNets, which transform the local order into a global one, thereby resolving these conflicts. Our experimental evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and promise of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, ICLR 2025 Workshop format</p></details> |

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden states. We present a practical framework for instantiating sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and expressive hidden states. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Similar to Transformer, TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The current version contains updates on related work and limitations.

This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

This raises the question of whether Transformer models are real reasoning engines, despite their impressive abilities in mathematical problem solving and code synthesis. In this paper, we offer a vanishing variance perspective on this issue. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that even for today's frontier models, a longer sequence length results in a decrease in variance in the output of the multi-head attention modules. On the argmax retrieval and dictionary lookup tasks, our experiments show that applying layer normalization after the attention outputs leads to significantly better length generalization. Our analyses attribute this improvement to a reduction-though not a complete elimination-of the distribution shift caused by vanishing variance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ruiningli.com/vanishing-variance.

Black-box models demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.</p></details> | 9 pages, preprint |

However, current approaches that heavily rely on repeated LLM-driven HTML parsing are computationally expensive and error-prone, particularly when handling dynamic web interfaces and multi-step tasks. We introduce PAFFA (Premeditated Actions For Fast Agents), a method that makes LLMs faster and more accurate in completing tasks on the internet using a novel inference-time technique that requires no task-specific training. PAFFA constructs an 'Action Library', leveraging the parametric knowledge of the base LLM to pre-compute browser interaction patterns that generalize across tasks. By strategically re-using LLM inference across tasks - either via 'Dist-Map' for task-agnostic identification of key interactive web elements, or 'Unravel' for first-encounter, stateful exploration of novel tasks/sites) - PAFFA drastically reduces inference time tokens by 87% while maintaining robust performance (achieving 0.57 vs. 0.50 step accuracy compared to baseline). Further, Unravel's ability to update its action library based on explorations allows generalization and adaptation to unseen websites. In sum, this work exhibits that LLM reasoning sequences can generalize across prompts, offering a way to scale inference-time techniques for internet-scale data with sublinear token count.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Current approaches conflate these components, obscuring their individual impacts and hindering systematic optimization. In this work, we propose \textbf{AIR}, a component-wise analysis framework that systematically isolates and optimizes each component while evaluating their synergistic effects. Through rigorous experimentation, AIR reveals actionable principles: annotation simplicity (point-wise generative scoring), instruction inference stability (variance-based filtering across LLMs), and response pair quality (moderate margins + high absolute scores). When combined, these principles yield +5.3 average gains over baseline method, even with only 14k high-quality pairs. Our work shifts preference dataset design from ad hoc scaling to component-aware optimization, offering a blueprint for efficient, reproducible alignment.</p></details> | 29 pages, 11 figures |

This task is typically addressed by finding a graph Laplacian on which the observed signals are smooth. With the extension of graphs to hypergraphs - where edges can connect more than two nodes - graph learning methods have similarly been generalized to hypergraphs. However, the absence of a unified framework for calculating total variation has led to divergent definitions of smoothness and, consequently, differing approaches to hyperedge recovery. We confront this challenge through generalization of several previously proposed hypergraph total variations, subsequently allowing ease of substitution into a vector based optimization. To this end, we propose a novel hypergraph learning method that recovers a hypergraph topology from time-series signals based on a smoothness prior. Our approach addresses key limitations in prior works, such as hyperedge selection and convergence issues, by formulating the problem as a convex optimization solved via a forward-backward-forward algorithm, ensuring guaranteed convergence. Additionally, we introduce a process that simultaneously limits the span of the hyperedge search and maintains a valid hyperedge selection set. In doing so, our method becomes scalable in increasingly complex network structures. The experimental results demonstrate improved performance, in terms of accuracy, over other state-of-the-art hypergraph inference methods; furthermore, we empirically show our method to be robust to total variation terms, biased towards global smoothness, and scalable to larger hypergraphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, despite their effectiveness, they lack interpretability, as they are unable to explain or justify their results. To address the challenge of interpretable image classification, this paper introduces a novel framework, named Interpretable Intuitionistic Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (I2FCMs).Intuitionistic FCMs (iFCMs) have been proposed as an extension of FCMs offering a natural mechanism to assess the quality of their output through the estimation of hesitancy, a concept resembling human hesitation in decision making. In the context of image classification, hesitancy is considered as a degree of unconfidence with which an image is categorized to a class. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time iFCMs are applied for image classification. Further novel contributions of the introduced framework include the following: a) a feature extraction process focusing on the most informative image regions; b) a learning algorithm for automatic data-driven determination of the intuitionistic fuzzy interconnections of the iFCM, thereby reducing human intervention in the definition of the graph structure; c) an inherently interpretable classification approach based on image contents, providing understandable explanations of its predictions, using linguistic terms. Furthermore, the proposed I2FCM framework can be applied to DL models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), rendering them interpretable. The effectiveness of I2FCM is evaluated on publicly available datasets, and the results confirm that it can provide enhanced classification performance, while providing interpretable inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible journal publication</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive functional principal components analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16091v4)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional data analysis almost always involves smoothing discrete observations into curves, because they are never observed in continuous time and rarely without error. Although smoothing parameters affect the subsequent inference, data-driven methods for selecting these parameters are not well-developed, frustrated by the difficulty of using all the information shared by curves while being computationally efficient. On the one hand, smoothing individual curves in an isolated, albeit sophisticated way, ignores useful signals present in other curves. On the other hand, bandwidth selection by automatic procedures such as cross-validation after pooling all the curves together quickly become computationally unfeasible due to the large number of data points. In this paper we propose a new data-driven, adaptive kernel smoothing, specifically tailored for functional principal components analysis through the derivation of sharp, explicit risk bounds for the eigen-elements. The minimization of these quadratic risk bounds provide refined, yet computationally efficient bandwidth rules for each eigen-element separately. Both common and independent design cases are allowed. Rates of convergence for the estimators are derived. An extensive simulation study, designed in a versatile manner to closely mimic the characteristics of real data sets supports our methodological contribution.

For example, in the field of renewable energy sources there is high variability and uncertainty of power production, which makes forecasting and the evaluation hereof crucial both for power trading and power grid balancing. In particular, probabilistic forecasts represented by ensembles are popular due to their ability to cover the full range of scenarios that can occur, thus enabling forecast users to make more informed decisions than what would be possible with simple deterministic forecasts. The selection of open source software that supports evaluation of ensemble forecasts, and especially event detection, is currently limited. As a solution, evalprob4cast is a new R-package for probabilistic forecast evaluation that aims to provide its users with all the tools needed for the assessment of ensemble forecasts, in the form of metrics and visualization methods. Both univariate and multivariate probabilistic forecasts as well as event detection are covered. Furthermore, it offers a user-friendly design where all of the evaluation methods can be applied in a fast and easy way, as long as the input data is organized in accordance with the format defined by the package. While its development is motivated by forecasting of renewables, the package can be used for any application with ensemble forecasts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

As latency is principally inevitable, video prediction can be utilized to mitigate the latency and ultimately enable zero-latency transmission. However, most of the existing video prediction methods are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. In this work, we therefore propose real-time video prediction towards the zero-latency interaction over networks, called IFRVP (Intermediate Feature Refinement Video Prediction). Firstly, we propose three training methods for video prediction that extend frame interpolation models, where we utilize a simple convolution-only frame interpolation network based on IFRNet. Secondly, we introduce ELAN-based residual blocks into the prediction models to improve both inference speed and accuracy.

Previous studies have unveiled the roles of attention blocks in the U-Net. However, they overlook the dynamic evolution of their importance during the inference process, which hinders their further exploitation to improve image applications. In this study, we first theoretically proved that, re-weighting the outputs of the Transformer blocks within the U-Net is a "free lunch" for improving the signal-to-noise ratio during the sampling process. Next, we proposed Importance Probe to uncover and quantify the dynamic shifts in importance of the Transformer blocks throughout the denoising process. Finally, we design an adaptive importance-based re-weighting schedule tailored to specific image generation and editing tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the inference process, and enhances the aesthetic quality of the samples with identity consistency. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into any U-Net-based architecture.

Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

Owing to its sensing capabilities in all weather conditions, 4D radar has recently received much attention. However, compared to LiDAR, 4D radar provides much sparser point cloud. In this paper, we propose a 3D object detection method, termed ZFusion, which fuses 4D radar and vision modality. As the core of ZFusion, our proposed FP-DDCA (Feature Pyramid-Double Deformable Cross Attention) fuser complements the (sparse) radar information and (dense) vision information, effectively. Specifically, with a feature-pyramid structure, the FP-DDCA fuser packs Transformer blocks to interactively fuse multi-modal features at different scales, thus enhancing perception accuracy. In addition, we utilize the Depth-Context-Split view transformation module due to the physical properties of 4D radar. Considering that 4D radar has a much lower cost than LiDAR, ZFusion is an attractive alternative to LiDAR-based methods. In typical traffic scenarios like the VoD (View-of-Delft) dataset, experiments show that with reasonable inference speed, ZFusion achieved the state-of-the-art mAP (mean average precision) in the region of interest, while having competitive mAP in the entire area compared to the baseline methods, which demonstrates performance close to LiDAR and greatly outperforms those camera-only methods.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 WDFM-AD |
| **[Dual Low-Rank Adaptation for Continual Learning with Pre-Trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00623v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of foundation models, we revisit continual learning~(CL), which aims to enable vision transformers (ViTs) to learn new tasks over time. However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a persistent challenge, particularly in the presence of significant domain shifts across tasks. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. The orthogonal LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in an orthogonal subspace of previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while the residual LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in the residual subspace spanned by task-specific bases without interaction across tasks, offering complementary capabilities for fine-tuning new tasks. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and memory efficiency over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There is a major deduction error in Section 4.1 of the paper, and the relevant results in Table 1 and Table 2 need to be corrected</p></details> |

However, deploying large diffusion models on computationally restricted devices such as mobile phones remains impractical due to the large model size and high latency. This is compounded for SR as it often operates at high res (e.g. 4Kx3K). In this work, we introduce Edge-SD-SR, the first parameter efficient and low latency diffusion model for image super-resolution. Edge-SD-SR consists of ~169M parameters, including UNet, encoder and decoder, and has a complexity of only ~142 GFLOPs. To maintain a high visual quality on such low compute budget, we introduce a number of training strategies: (i) A novel conditioning mechanism on the low resolution input, coined bidirectional conditioning, which tailors the SD model for the SR task. (ii) Joint training of the UNet and encoder, while decoupling the encodings of the HR and LR images and using a dedicated schedule. (iii) Finetuning the decoder using the UNet's output to directly tailor the decoder to the latents obtained at inference time. Edge-SD-SR runs efficiently on device, e.g. it can upscale a 128x128 patch to 512x512 in 38 msec while running on a Samsung S24 DSP, and of a 512x512 to 2048x2048 (requiring 25 model evaluations) in just ~1.1 sec. Furthermore, we show that Edge-SD-SR matches or even outperforms state-of-the-art SR approaches on the most established SR benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The formula allows for estimation of the Stieltjes transform of the population spectral distribution $s_H(z)$, when $z$ is sufficiently far from the support of the population spectral distribution $H$. If the dimension $d$ and the sample size $n$ go to infinity simultaneously such that $\frac{d}{n} \rightarrow c>0$, the estimation error is shown to be asymptotically less than $\frac{n^{\varepsilon}}{n}$ for arbitrary $\varepsilon > 0$. By integrating along a curve around the support of $H$, estimators for population linear spectral statistics are constructed, which benefit from this convergence speed of $\frac{n^{\varepsilon}}{n}$.</p></details> | 34 pages, 2 figures |

| **[Mixing Samples to Address Weak Overlap in Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10801v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In observational studies, the assumption of sufficient overlap (positivity) is fundamental for the identification and estimation of causal effects. Failing to account for this assumption yields inaccurate and potentially infeasible estimators. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet novel approach, \textit{mixing}, which mitigates overlap violations by constructing a synthetic treated group that combines treated and control units. Our strategy offers three key advantages. First, it improves the accuracy of the estimator by preserving unbiasedness while reducing variance. The benefit is particularly significant in settings with weak overlap, though the method remains effective regardless of the overlap level. This phenomenon results from the shrinkage of propensity scores in the mixed sample, which enhances robustness to poor overlap. Second, it enables direct estimation of the target estimand without discarding extreme observations or modifying the target population, thus facilitating a straightforward interpretation of the results. Third, the mixing approach is highly adaptable to various weighting schemes, including contemporary methods such as entropy balancing. The estimation of the Mixed IPW (MIPW) estimator is done via M-estimation, and the method extends to a broader class of weighting estimators through a resampling algorithm. We illustrate the mixing approach through extensive simulation studies and provide practical guidance with a real-data analysis.</p></details> | 37 pages, 5 figures |

We consider a legitimate communication link in the presence of multiple jammers and propose deploying a movable antenna array at the receiver to combat jamming attacks. We formulate the problem as a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio maximization, by jointly optimizing the receive beamforming and antenna element positioning. Due to the non-convexity and multi-fold difficulties from an optimization perspective, we develop a deep learning-based framework where beamforming is tackled as a Rayleigh quotient problem, while antenna positioning is addressed through multi-layer perceptron training. The neural network parameters are optimized using stochastic gradient descent to achieve effective jamming mitigation strategy, featuring offline training with marginal complexity for online inference. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal anti-jamming performance thereby significantly improving the efficiency in strategy determination.</p></details> | Accepted @ IEEE TVT |

Model quantization has emerged as a key technique to enable efficient LLM inference by reducing model size and computational overhead. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 28 quantized LLMs from the Ollama library, which applies by default Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and weight-only quantization techniques, deployed on an edge device (Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM). We evaluate energy efficiency, inference performance, and output accuracy across multiple quantization levels and task types. Models are benchmarked on five standardized datasets (CommonsenseQA, BIG-Bench Hard, TruthfulQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval), and we employ a high-resolution, hardware-based energy measurement tool to capture real-world power consumption. Our findings reveal the trade-offs between energy efficiency, inference speed, and accuracy in different quantization settings, highlighting configurations that optimize LLM deployment for resource-constrained environments. By integrating hardware-level energy profiling with LLM benchmarking, this study provides actionable insights for sustainable AI, bridging a critical gap in existing research on energy-aware LLM deployment.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

When a robot lacks the necessary tools to accomplish a task requested by a human, it autonomously designs the required instruments and learns how to use them to achieve the goal. Evolution 6.0 is an autonomous robotic system powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Vision-Language Action (VLA) models, and Text-to-3D generative models for tool design and task execution. The system comprises two key modules: the Tool Generation Module, which fabricates task-specific tools from visual and textual data, and the Action Generation Module, which converts natural language instructions into robotic actions. It integrates QwenVLM for environmental understanding, OpenVLA for task execution, and Llama-Mesh for 3D tool generation. Evaluation results demonstrate a 90% success rate for tool generation with a 10-second inference time, and action generation achieving 83.5% in physical and visual generalization, 70% in motion generalization, and 37% in semantic generalization. Future improvements will focus on bimanual manipulation, expanded task capabilities, and enhanced environmental interpretation to improve real-world adaptability.</p></details> | Submitted to IROS |
| **[Minority-Focused Text-to-Image Generation via Prompt Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07838v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the generation of minority samples using pretrained text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models. Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for high-quality generation. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that encourages emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Extensive experiments conducted across various types of T2I models demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.

| **[FRESA: Feedforward Reconstruction of Personalized Skinned Avatars from Few Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19207v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel method for reconstructing personalized 3D human avatars with realistic animation from only a few images. Due to the large variations in body shapes, poses, and cloth types, existing methods mostly require hours of per-subject optimization during inference, which limits their practical applications. In contrast, we learn a universal prior from over a thousand clothed humans to achieve instant feedforward generation and zero-shot generalization. Specifically, instead of rigging the avatar with shared skinning weights, we jointly infer personalized avatar shape, skinning weights, and pose-dependent deformations, which effectively improves overall geometric fidelity and reduces deformation artifacts. Moreover, to normalize pose variations and resolve coupled ambiguity between canonical shapes and skinning weights, we design a 3D canonicalization process to produce pixel-aligned initial conditions, which helps to reconstruct fine-grained geometric details. We then propose a multi-frame feature aggregation to robustly reduce artifacts introduced in canonicalization and fuse a plausible avatar preserving person-specific identities. Finally, we train the model in an end-to-end framework on a large-scale capture dataset, which contains diverse human subjects paired with high-quality 3D scans. Extensive experiments show that our method generates more authentic reconstruction and animation than state-of-the-arts, and can be directly generalized to inputs from casually taken phone photos.

Producing such semantic co-speech gestures has been a major challenge for the existing neural systems that can generate rhythmic beat gestures, but struggle to produce semantically meaningful gestures. Therefore, we present RAG-Gesture, a diffusion-based gesture generation approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce natural-looking and semantically rich gestures. Our neuro-explicit gesture generation approach is designed to produce semantic gestures grounded in interpretable linguistic knowledge. We achieve this by using explicit domain knowledge to retrieve exemplar motions from a database of co-speech gestures. Once retrieved, we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further, we propose a control paradigm for guidance, that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence. Our comparative evaluations demonstrate the validity of our approach against recent gesture generation approaches.

| **[VLIPP: Towards Physically Plausible Video Generation with Vision and Language Informed Physical Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23368v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video diffusion models (VDMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the generation of highly realistic videos and drawing the attention of the community in their potential as world simulators. However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics with vision and language informed physical prior. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods.

Unlike previous methods that require extensive training on captured video sequences or rely on auxiliary neural networks for animation and rendering during inference, our approach generates Gaussian heads that are immediately animatable and renderable. Specifically, LAM creates an animatable Gaussian head in a single forward pass, enabling reenactment and rendering without additional networks or post-processing steps. This capability allows for seamless integration into existing rendering pipelines, ensuring real-time animation and rendering across a wide range of platforms, including mobile phones. The centerpiece of our framework is the canonical Gaussian attributes generator, which utilizes FLAME canonical points as queries. These points interact with multi-scale image features through a Transformer to accurately predict Gaussian attributes in the canonical space. The reconstructed canonical Gaussian avatar can then be animated utilizing standard linear blend skinning (LBS) with corrective blendshapes as the FLAME model did and rendered in real-time on various platforms.

However, their slow inference speed limits practical applications. Despite the development of various distillation techniques for diffusion models, we found that naive diffusion distillation methods do not yield satisfactory results. Distilled models exhibit reduced robustness with open-set input images and a decreased correlation between audio and video compared to teacher models, undermining the advantages of diffusion models. To address this, we propose FADA (Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation). We first designed a mixed-supervised loss to leverage data of varying quality and enhance the overall model capability as well as robustness. Additionally, we propose a multi-CFG distillation with learnable tokens to utilize the correlation between audio and reference image conditions, reducing the threefold inference runs caused by multi-CFG with acceptable quality degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FADA generates vivid videos comparable to recent diffusion model-based methods while achieving an NFE speedup of 4.17-12.5 times.

In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment.

This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs.

Due to the limited control of audio signals in driving human motion, existing methods often add auxiliary spatial signals to stabilize movements, which may compromise the naturalness and freedom of motion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end audio-only conditioned video diffusion model named Loopy. Specifically, we designed an inter- and intra-clip temporal module and an audio-to-latents module, enabling the model to leverage long-term motion information from the data to learn natural motion patterns and improving audio-portrait movement correlation. This method removes the need for manually specified spatial motion templates used in existing methods to constrain motion during inference.

| **[Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries For Fast Frequency Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03150v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%-57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages,7figures.Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy</p></details> |

Recently, deep learning has shown great potential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled measurements. However, one needs to train multiple models for different undersampling patterns and desired output image resolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such approaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling patterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different real-time imaging and diagnostic requirements. We propose a unified MRI reconstruction model robust to various measurement undersampling patterns and image resolutions. Our approach uses neural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture applied in both image and measurement spaces, to capture local and global features. Empirically, our model improves SSIM by 11% and PSNR by 4 dB over a state-of-the-art CNN (End-to-End VarNet), with 600$\times$ faster inference than diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enables zero-shot super-resolution and extended field-of-view reconstruction, offering a versatile and efficient solution for clinical MR imaging. Our unified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to various measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly effective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging.

While recent approaches achieve significant improvements in denoising quality by leveraging deep learning, they are prone to unexpected failures due to discrepancies between training data distributions and the wide variety of noise patterns found in real-world videos. These methods also tend to be slow and lack user control. In contrast, traditional denoising methods perform reliably on in-the-wild videos and run relatively quickly on modern hardware. However, they require manually tuning parameters for each input video, which is not only tedious but also requires skill. We bridge the gap between these two paradigms by proposing a differentiable denoising pipeline based on traditional methods. A neural network is then trained to predict the optimal denoising parameters for each specific input, resulting in a robust and efficient approach that also supports user control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://srameo.github.io/projects/levd/</p></details> |
| **[Variational Search Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06142v5)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop VSD, a method for conditioning a generative model of discrete, combinatorial designs on a rare desired class by efficiently evaluating a black-box (e.g. experiment, simulation) in a batch sequential manner. We call this task active generation; we formalize active generation's requirements and desiderata, and formulate a solution via variational inference. VSD uses off-the-shelf gradient based optimization routines, can learn powerful generative models for desirable designs, and can take advantage of scalable predictive models. We derive asymptotic convergence rates for learning the true conditional generative distribution of designs with certain configurations of our method. After illustrating the generative model on images, we empirically demonstrate that VSD can outperform existing baseline methods on a set of real sequence-design problems in various protein and DNA/RNA engineering tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster in the thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[NuWa: Deriving Lightweight Task-Specific Vision Transformers for Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03118v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in computer vision tasks but lack flexibility for edge devices' diverse needs. A vital issue is that ViTs pre-trained to cover a broad range of tasks are \textit{over-qualified} for edge devices that usually demand only part of a ViT's knowledge for specific tasks. Their task-specific accuracy on these edge devices is suboptimal. We discovered that small ViTs that focus on device-specific tasks can improve model accuracy and in the meantime, accelerate model inference. This paper presents NuWa, an approach that derives small ViTs from the base ViT for edge devices with specific task requirements. NuWa can transfer task-specific knowledge extracted from the base ViT into small ViTs that fully leverage constrained resources on edge devices to maximize model accuracy with inference latency assurance. Experiments with three base ViTs on three public datasets demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art solutions, NuWa improves model accuracy by up to $\text{11.83}\%$ and accelerates model inference by 1.29$\times$ - 2.79$\times$.

| **[The Amenability Framework: Rethinking Causal Ordering Without Estimating Causal Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02456v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Who should we prioritize for intervention when we cannot estimate intervention effects? In many applied domains (e.g., advertising, customer retention, and behavioral nudging) prioritization is guided by predictive models that estimate outcome probabilities rather than causal effects. This paper investigates when these predictions (scores) can effectively rank individuals by their intervention effects, particularly when direct effect estimation is infeasible or unreliable. We propose a conceptual framework based on amenability: an individual's latent proclivity to be influenced by an intervention. We then formalize conditions under which predictive scores serve as effective proxies for amenability. These conditions justify using non-causal scores for intervention prioritization, even when the scores do not directly estimate effects. We further show that, under plausible assumptions, predictive models can outperform causal effect estimators in ranking individuals by intervention effects. Empirical evidence from an advertising context supports our theoretical findings, demonstrating that predictive modeling can offer a more robust approach to targeting than effect estimation. Our framework suggests a shift in focus, from estimating effects to inferring who is amenable, as a practical and theoretically grounded strategy for prioritizing interventions in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This was meant to serve as a replacement of arXiv:2206.12532, not a new submission.

| **[The Use of Gaze-Derived Confidence of Inferred Operator Intent in Adjusting Safety-Conscious Haptic Assistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03098v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans directly completing tasks in dangerous or hazardous conditions is not always possible where these tasks are increasingly be performed remotely by teleoperated robots. However, teleoperation is difficult since the operator feels a disconnect with the robot caused by missing feedback from several senses, including touch, and the lack of depth in the video feedback presented to the operator. To overcome this problem, the proposed system actively infers the operator's intent and provides assistance based on the predicted intent. Furthermore, a novel method of calculating confidence in the inferred intent modifies the human-in-the-loop control. The operator's gaze is employed to intuitively indicate the target before the manipulation with the robot begins. A potential field method is used to provide a guiding force towards the intended target, and a safety boundary reduces risk of damage. Modifying these assistances based on the confidence level in the operator's intent makes the control more natural, and gives the robot an intuitive understanding of its human master. Initial validation results show the ability of the system to improve accuracy, execution time, and reduce operator error.</p></details> | 12 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Context-Aware Self-Adaptation for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03064v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization aims at developing suitable learning algorithms in source training domains such that the model learned can generalize well on a different unseen testing domain. We present a novel two-stage approach called Context-Aware Self-Adaptation (CASA) for domain generalization. CASA simulates an approximate meta-generalization scenario and incorporates a self-adaptation module to adjust pre-trained meta source models to the meta-target domains while maintaining their predictive capability on the meta-source domains. The core concept of self-adaptation involves leveraging contextual information, such as the mean of mini-batch features, as domain knowledge to automatically adapt a model trained in the first stage to new contexts in the second stage. Lastly, we utilize an ensemble of multiple meta-source models to perform inference on the testing domain. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 AdvML Frontiers workshop</p></details> |
| **[Cooperative Inference for Real-Time 3D Human Pose Estimation in Multi-Device Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03052v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and real-time three-dimensional (3D) pose estimation is challenging in resource-constrained and dynamic environments owing to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel cooperative inference method for real-time 3D human pose estimation in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. In the proposed method, multiple end devices equipped with lightweight inference models employ dual confidence thresholds to filter ambiguous images. Only the filtered images are offloaded to an edge server with a more powerful inference model for re-evaluation, thereby improving the estimation accuracy under computational and communication constraints. We numerically analyze the performance of the proposed inference method in terms of the inference accuracy and end-to-end delay and formulate a joint optimization problem to derive the optimal confidence thresholds and transmission time for each device, with the objective of minimizing the mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) while satisfying the required end-to-end delay constraint. To solve this problem, we demonstrate that minimizing the MPJPE is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the inference accuracies for all devices, decompose the problem into manageable subproblems, and present a low-complexity optimization algorithm to obtain a near-optimal solution. The experimental results show that a trade-off exists between the MPJPE and end-to-end delay depending on the confidence thresholds. Furthermore, the results confirm that the proposed cooperative inference method achieves a significant reduction in the MPJPE through the optimal selection of confidence thresholds and transmission times, while consistently satisfying the end-to-end delay requirement in various MEC environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Multi-marginal Schrödinger Bridges with Iterative Reference Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06277v4)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practitioners often aim to infer an unobserved population trajectory using sample snapshots at multiple time points. E.g., given single-cell sequencing data, scientists would like to learn how gene expression changes over a cell's life cycle. But sequencing any cell destroys that cell. So we can access data for any particular cell only at a single time point, but we have data across many cells. The deep learning community has recently explored using Schr\"odinger bridges (SBs) and their extensions in similar settings. However, existing methods either (1) interpolate between just two time points or (2) require a single fixed reference dynamic (often set to Brownian motion within SBs). But learning piecewise from adjacent time points can fail to capture long-term dependencies. And practitioners are typically able to specify a model family for the reference dynamic but not the exact values of the parameters within it. So we propose a new method that (1) learns the unobserved trajectories from sample snapshots across multiple time points and (2) requires specification only of a family of reference dynamics, not a single fixed one. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on simulated and real data.</p></details> | 39 pages, 9 figures |

In particular, our technique enables high-quality scene reconstruction from Large field-of-view (FOV) imagery taken with wide-angle lenses, allowing the scene to be modeled from a smaller number of images. Our approach introduces a novel method for modeling complex lens distortions using a hybrid network that combines invertible residual networks with explicit grids. This design effectively regularizes the optimization process, achieving greater accuracy than conventional camera models. Additionally, we propose a cubemap-based resampling strategy to support large FOV images without sacrificing resolution or introducing distortion artifacts. Our method is compatible with the fast rasterization of Gaussian Splatting, adaptable to a wide variety of camera lens distortion, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://denghilbert.github.io/self-cali/</p></details> |
| **[Comprehensive Relighting: Generalizable and Consistent Monocular Human Relighting and Harmonization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03011v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Comprehensive Relighting, the first all-in-one approach that can both control and harmonize the lighting from an image or video of humans with arbitrary body parts from any scene. Building such a generalizable model is extremely challenging due to the lack of dataset, restricting existing image-based relighting models to a specific scenario (e.g., face or static human). To address this challenge, we repurpose a pre-trained diffusion model as a general image prior and jointly model the human relighting and background harmonization in the coarse-to-fine framework. To further enhance the temporal coherence of the relighting, we introduce an unsupervised temporal lighting model that learns the lighting cycle consistency from many real-world videos without any ground truth. In inference time, our temporal lighting module is combined with the diffusion models through the spatio-temporal feature blending algorithms without extra training; and we apply a new guided refinement as a post-processing to preserve the high-frequency details from the input image. In the experiments, Comprehensive Relighting shows a strong generalizability and lighting temporal coherence, outperforming existing image-based human relighting and harmonization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://junyingw.github.io/paper/relighting.

| **[TILP: Differentiable Learning of Temporal Logical Rules on Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12309v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared with static knowledge graphs, temporal knowledge graphs (tKG), which can capture the evolution and change of information over time, are more realistic and general. However, due to the complexity that the notion of time introduces to the learning of the rules, an accurate graph reasoning, e.g., predicting new links between entities, is still a difficult problem. In this paper, we propose TILP, a differentiable framework for temporal logical rules learning. By designing a constrained random walk mechanism and the introduction of temporal operators, we ensure the efficiency of our model. We present temporal features modeling in tKG, e.g., recurrence, temporal order, interval between pair of relations, and duration, and incorporate it into our learning process. We compare TILP with state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets. We show that our proposed framework can improve upon the performance of baseline methods while providing interpretable results. In particular, we consider various scenarios in which training samples are limited, data is biased, and the time range between training and inference are different. In all these cases, TILP works much better than the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | ICLR 2023 |

However, it is difficult to collect large real-world visual datasets in this domain, in part due to privacy and expense constraints, which in turn presents significant challenges for training and deploying deep learning models. Existing in-bed human mesh estimation methods often rely heavily on real-world data, limiting their ability to generalize across different in-bed scenarios, such as varying coverings and environmental settings. To address this, we propose a Sim-to-Real Transfer Framework for in-bed human mesh recovery from overhead depth images, which leverages large-scale synthetic data alongside limited or no real-world samples. We introduce a diffusion model that bridges the gap between synthetic data and real data to support generalization in real-world in-bed pose and body inference scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and adaptability across diverse healthcare scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 19 figures.

Vision-based tactile sensors are promising for providing multimodal capabilities and high robustness, yet existing technologies still have limitations in sensitivity, spatial resolution, and high computational demands of deep learning-based image processing. This paper presents a comprehensive approach combining a novel microstructure-based sensor design and efficient image processing, demonstrating that carefully engineered microstructures can significantly enhance performance while reducing computational load. Without traditional tracking markers, our sensor incorporates an surface with micromachined trenches, as an example of microstructures, which modulate light transmission and amplify the response to applied force. The amplified image features can be extracted by a ultra lightweight convolutional neural network to accurately inferring contact location, displacement, and applied force with high precision. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrated that the micro trenches significantly amplified the visual effects of shape distortion. Using only a commercial webcam, the sensor system effectively detected forces below 5 mN, and achieved a millimetre-level single-point spatial resolution. Using a model with only one convolutional layer, a mean absolute error below 0.05 mm was achieved. Its soft sensor body allows seamless integration with soft robots, while its immunity to electrical crosstalk and interference guarantees reliability in complex human-machine environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 28 figures, 2 tables; rearranged figures; updated supplymentary information</p></details> |
| **[Floxels: Fast Unsupervised Voxel Based Scene Flow Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04718v2)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene flow estimation is a foundational task for many robotic applications, including robust dynamic object detection, automatic labeling, and sensor synchronization. Two types of approaches to the problem have evolved: 1) Supervised and 2) optimization-based methods. Supervised methods are fast during inference and achieve high-quality results, however, they are limited by the need for large amounts of labeled training data and are susceptible to domain gaps. In contrast, unsupervised test-time optimization methods do not face the problem of domain gaps but usually suffer from substantial runtime, exhibit artifacts, or fail to converge to the right solution. In this work, we mitigate several limitations of existing optimization-based methods. To this end, we 1) introduce a simple voxel grid-based model that improves over the standard MLP-based formulation in multiple dimensions and 2) introduce a new multiframe loss formulation. 3) We combine both contributions in our new method, termed Floxels. On the Argoverse 2 benchmark, Floxels is surpassed only by EulerFlow among unsupervised methods while achieving comparable performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Floxels achieves a massive speedup of more than ~60 - 140x over EulerFlow, reducing the runtime from a day to 10 minutes per sequence. Over the faster but low-quality baseline, NSFP, Floxels achieves a speedup of ~14x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

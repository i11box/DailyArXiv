| **[Relational Visual Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07833v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans do not just see attribute similarity -- we also see relational similarity. An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page, data, and code: https://thaoshibe.github.io/relsim</p></details> |
| **[UnityVideo: Unified Multi-Modal Multi-Task Learning for Enhancing World-Aware Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07831v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video generation models demonstrate impressive synthesis capabilities but remain limited by single-modality conditioning, constraining their holistic world understanding. This stems from insufficient cross-modal interaction and limited modal diversity for comprehensive world knowledge representation. To address these limitations, we introduce UnityVideo, a unified framework for world-aware video generation that jointly learns across multiple modalities (segmentation masks, human skeletons, DensePose, optical flow, and depth maps) and training paradigms. Our approach features two core components: (1) dynamic noising to unify heterogeneous training paradigms, and (2) a modality switcher with an in-context learner that enables unified processing via modular parameters and contextual learning. We contribute a large-scale unified dataset with 1.3M samples. Through joint optimization, UnityVideo accelerates convergence and significantly enhances zero-shot generalization to unseen data. We demonstrate that UnityVideo achieves superior video quality, consistency, and improved alignment with physical world constraints.

| **[OpenVE-3M: A Large-Scale High-Quality Dataset for Instruction-Guided Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07826v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality and diversity of instruction-based image editing datasets are continuously increasing, yet large-scale, high-quality datasets for instruction-based video editing remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce OpenVE-3M, an open-source, large-scale, and high-quality dataset for instruction-based video editing. It comprises two primary categories: spatially-aligned edits (Global Style, Background Change, Local Change, Local Remove, Local Add, and Subtitles Edit) and non-spatially-aligned edits (Camera Multi-Shot Edit and Creative Edit). All edit types are generated via a meticulously designed data pipeline with rigorous quality filtering. OpenVE-3M surpasses existing open-source datasets in terms of scale, diversity of edit types, instruction length, and overall quality. Furthermore, to address the lack of a unified benchmark in the field, we construct OpenVE-Bench, containing 431 video-edit pairs that cover a diverse range of editing tasks with three key metrics highly aligned with human judgment. We present OpenVE-Edit, a 5B model trained on our dataset that demonstrates remarkable efficiency and effectiveness by setting a new state-of-the-art on OpenVE-Bench, outperforming all prior open-source models including a 14B baseline.

| **[Training Task Reasoning LLM Agents for Multi-turn Task Planning via Single-turn Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20616v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in a lower bound of the multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)</p></details> |
| **[Provable Long-Range Benefits of Next-Token Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07818v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Why do modern language models, trained to do well on next-word prediction, appear to generate coherent documents and capture long-range structure? Here we show that next-token prediction is provably powerful for learning longer-range structure, even with common neural network architectures. Specifically, we prove that optimizing next-token prediction over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) yields a model that closely approximates the training distribution: for held-out documents sampled from the training distribution, no algorithm of bounded description length limited to examining the next $k$ tokens, for any $k$, can distinguish between $k$ consecutive tokens of such documents and $k$ tokens generated by the learned language model following the same prefix. We provide polynomial bounds (in $k$, independent of the document length) on the model size needed to achieve such $k$-token indistinguishability, offering a complexity-theoretic explanation for the long-range coherence observed in practice.</p></details> | 66 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Beyond the Singular: Revealing the Value of Multiple Generations in Benchmark Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08943v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant utility in real-world applications, exhibiting impressive capabilities in natural language processing and understanding. Benchmark evaluations are crucial for assessing the capabilities of LLMs as they can provide a comprehensive assessment of their strengths and weaknesses. However, current evaluation methods often overlook the inherent randomness of LLMs by employing deterministic generation strategies or relying on a single random sample, resulting in unaccounted sampling variance and unreliable benchmark score estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical statistical model that provides a more comprehensive representation of the benchmarking process by incorporating both benchmark characteristics and LLM randomness. We show that leveraging multiple generations improves the accuracy of estimating the benchmark score and reduces variance. Multiple generations also allow us to define $\mathbb P\left(\text{correct}\right)$, a prompt-level difficulty score based on correct ratios, providing fine-grained insights into individual prompts. Additionally, we create a data map that visualizes difficulty and semantics of prompts, enabling error detection and quality control in benchmark construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on LLM Evals</p></details> |
| **[Density Operator Expectation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22786v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning with density operators, the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics, is gaining prominence with rapid advances in quantum computing. Generative models based on density operators cannot yet handle tasks that are routinely handled by probabilistic models. The progress of latent variable models, a broad and influential class of probabilistic unsupervised models, was driven by the Expectation-Maximization framework. Deriving such a framework for density operators is challenging due to the non-commutativity of operators. To tackle this challenge, an inequality arising from the monotonicity of relative entropy is demonstrated to serve as an evidence lower bound for density operators. A minorant-maximization perspective on this bound leads to Density Operator Expectation Maximization (DO-EM), a general framework for training latent variable models defined through density operators. Through an information-geometric argument, the Expectation step in DO-EM is shown to be the Petz recovery map. The DO-EM algorithm is applied to Quantum Restricted Boltzmann Machines, adapting Contrastive Divergence to approximate the Maximization step gradient. Quantum interleaved Deep Boltzmann Machines and Quantum Gaussian-Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machines, new models introduced in this work, outperform their probabilistic counterparts on generative tasks when trained with similar computational resources and identical hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 34 pages 4 Figures.

| **[Understanding Privacy Risks in Code Models Through Training Dynamics: A Causal Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07814v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code (LLM4Code) have greatly improved developer productivity but also raise privacy concerns due to their reliance on open-source repositories containing abundant personally identifiable information (PII). Prior work shows that commercial models can reproduce sensitive PII, yet existing studies largely treat PII as a single category and overlook the heterogeneous risks among different types. We investigate whether distinct PII types vary in their likelihood of being learned and leaked by LLM4Code, and whether this relationship is causal. Our methodology includes building a dataset with diverse PII types, fine-tuning representative models of different scales, computing training dynamics on real PII data, and formulating a structural causal model to estimate the causal effect of learnability on leakage. Results show that leakage risks differ substantially across PII types and correlate with their training dynamics: easy-to-learn instances such as IP addresses exhibit higher leakage, while harder types such as keys and passwords leak less frequently. Ambiguous types show mixed behaviors. This work provides the first causal evidence that leakage risks are type-dependent and offers guidance for developing type-aware and learnability-aware defenses for LLM4Code.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Auditing Games for Sandbagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07810v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future AI systems could conceal their capabilities ('sandbagging') during evaluations, potentially misleading developers and auditors. We stress-tested sandbagging detection techniques using an auditing game. First, a red team fine-tuned five models, some of which conditionally underperformed, as a proxy for sandbagging. Second, a blue team used black-box, model-internals, or training-based approaches to identify sandbagging models. We found that the blue team could not reliably discriminate sandbaggers from benign models. Black-box approaches were defeated by effective imitation of a weaker model. Linear probes, a model-internals approach, showed more promise but their naive application was vulnerable to behaviours instilled by the red team. We also explored capability elicitation as a strategy for detecting sandbagging. Although Prompt-based elicitation was not reliable, training-based elicitation consistently elicited full performance from the sandbagging models, using only a single correct demonstration of the evaluation task. However the performance of benign models was sometimes also raised, so relying on elicitation as a detection strategy was prone to false-positives. In the short-term, we recommend developers remove potential sandbagging using on-distribution training for elicitation. In the longer-term, further research is needed to ensure the efficacy of training-based elicitation, and develop robust methods for sandbagging detection. We open source our model organisms at https://github.com/AI-Safety-Institute/sandbagging_auditing_games and select transcripts and results at https://huggingface.co/datasets/sandbagging-games/evaluation_logs .

| **[Incremental Generalized Hybrid A*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13392v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning. We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning. IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA* use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version of HA* (HA*M, an internal baseline). In simulated off- road experiments in a high-fidelity simulator, IGHA* outper- forms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex dynamics.

| **[Lang3D-XL: Language Embedded 3D Gaussians for Large-scale Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07807v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding a language field in a 3D representation enables richer semantic understanding of spatial environments by linking geometry with descriptive meaning. This allows for a more intuitive human-computer interaction, enabling querying or editing scenes using natural language, and could potentially improve tasks like scene retrieval, navigation, and multimodal reasoning. While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation. These are processed by rendering and passing them through a multi-resolution, feature-based, hash encoder. This significantly improves efficiency both in runtime and GPU memory. Second, we introduce an Attenuated Downsampler module and propose several regularizations addressing the semantic misalignment of ground truth 2D features. We evaluate our method on the in-the-wild HolyScenes dataset and demonstrate that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.

| **[Multi-view Pyramid Transformer: Look Coarser to See Broader](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07806v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Multi-view Pyramid Transformer (MVP), a scalable multi-view transformer architecture that directly reconstructs large 3D scenes from tens to hundreds of images in a single forward pass. Drawing on the idea of ``looking broader to see the whole, looking finer to see the details," MVP is built on two core design principles: 1) a local-to-global inter-view hierarchy that gradually broadens the model's perspective from local views to groups and ultimately the full scene, and 2) a fine-to-coarse intra-view hierarchy that starts from detailed spatial representations and progressively aggregates them into compact, information-dense tokens. This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes. We validate MVP on diverse datasets and show that, when coupled with 3D Gaussian Splatting as the underlying 3D representation, it achieves state-of-the-art generalizable reconstruction quality while maintaining high efficiency and scalability across a wide range of view configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: see https://gynjn.github.io/MVP/</p></details> |
| **[Group Representational Position Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07805v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GRAPE (Group RepresentAtional Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \in \mathbb{R}$) acts as $\mathbf{G}(n)=\exp(n\,ω\,\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

| **[OneStory: Coherent Multi-Shot Video Generation with Adaptive Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07802v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Storytelling in real-world videos often unfolds through multiple shots -- discontinuous yet semantically connected clips that together convey a coherent narrative. However, existing multi-shot video generation (MSV) methods struggle to effectively model long-range cross-shot context, as they rely on limited temporal windows or single keyframe conditioning, leading to degraded performance under complex narratives. In this work, we propose OneStory, enabling global yet compact cross-shot context modeling for consistent and scalable narrative generation. OneStory reformulates MSV as a next-shot generation task, enabling autoregressive shot synthesis while leveraging pretrained image-to-video (I2V) models for strong visual conditioning. We introduce two key modules: a Frame Selection module that constructs a semantically-relevant global memory based on informative frames from prior shots, and an Adaptive Conditioner that performs importance-guided patchification to generate compact context for direct conditioning. We further curate a high-quality multi-shot dataset with referential captions to mirror real-world storytelling patterns, and design effective training strategies under the next-shot paradigm. Finetuned from a pretrained I2V model on our curated 60K dataset, OneStory achieves state-of-the-art narrative coherence across diverse and complex scenes in both text- and image-conditioned settings, enabling controllable and immersive long-form video storytelling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zhaochongan.github.io/projects/OneStory</p></details> |
| **[Tyche: Stochastic In-Context Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13650v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing learning-based solutions to medical image segmentation have two important shortcomings. First, for most new segmentation task, a new model has to be trained or fine-tuned. This requires extensive resources and machine learning expertise, and is therefore often infeasible for medical researchers and clinicians. Second, most existing segmentation methods produce a single deterministic segmentation mask for a given image. In practice however, there is often considerable uncertainty about what constitutes the correct segmentation, and different expert annotators will often segment the same image differently. We tackle both of these problems with Tyche, a model that uses a context set to generate stochastic predictions for previously unseen tasks without the need to retrain. Tyche differs from other in-context segmentation methods in two important ways. (1) We introduce a novel convolution block architecture that enables interactions among predictions. (2) We introduce in-context test-time augmentation, a new mechanism to provide prediction stochasticity. When combined with appropriate model design and loss functions, Tyche can predict a set of plausible diverse segmentation candidates for new or unseen medical images and segmentation tasks without the need to retrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE / CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR) 2024 as a highlight.

| **[Large Causal Models from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07796v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new paradigm for building large causal models (LCMs) that exploits the enormous potential latent in today's large language models (LLMs). We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology. We discuss the limitations of the current DEMOCRITUS system, and outline directions for extending its capabilities.</p></details> | 29 pages |
| **[ReasonBENCH: Benchmarking the (In)Stability of LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07795v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in settings where reasoning, such as multi-step problem solving and chain-of-thought, is essential. Yet, current evaluation practices overwhelmingly report single-run accuracy while ignoring the intrinsic uncertainty that naturally arises from stochastic decoding. This omission creates a blind spot because practitioners cannot reliably assess whether a method's reported performance is stable, reproducible, or cost-consistent. We introduce ReasonBENCH, the first benchmark designed to quantify the underlying instability in LLM reasoning. ReasonBENCH provides (i) a modular evaluation library that standardizes reasoning frameworks, models, and tasks, (ii) a multi-run protocol that reports statistically reliable metrics for both quality and cost, and (iii) a public leaderboard to encourage variance-aware reporting. Across tasks from different domains, we find that the vast majority of reasoning strategies and models exhibit high instability. Notably, even strategies with similar average performance can display confidence intervals up to four times wider, and the top-performing methods often incur higher and less stable costs. Such instability compromises reproducibility across runs and, consequently, the reliability of reported performance. To better understand these dynamics, we further analyze the impact of prompts, model families, and scale on the trade-off between solve rate and stability. Our results highlight reproducibility as a critical dimension for reliable LLM reasoning and provide a foundation for future reasoning methods and uncertainty quantification techniques. ReasonBENCH is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/ReasonBench .</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

However, maintaining homeostasis within these networks is challenging, as it requires continuous adjustment of neural responses to preserve equilibrium and optimal processing efficiency amidst diverse and often unpredictable input signals. In response to these challenges, we propose the Asynchronous Bioplausible Neuron (ABN), a dynamic spike firing mechanism to auto-adjust the variations in the input signal. Comprehensive evaluation across various datasets demonstrates ABN's enhanced performance in image classification and segmentation, maintenance of neural equilibrium, and energy efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Aligning Machiavellian Agents: Behavior Steering via Test-Time Policy Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11551v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining alignment. For pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 AI Alignment Track</p></details> |

Exploring Ultra-Personalized AI-Powered AAC; an Autoethnographic Account](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13671v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generic AI auto-complete for message composition often fails to capture the nuance of personal identity, requiring significant editing. While harmless in low-stakes settings, for users of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, who rely on such systems for everyday communication, this editing burden is particularly acute. Intuitively, the need for edits would be lower if language models were personalized to the communication of the specific user. While personalization has been shown to be technically feasible, it raises questions about how such systems affect AAC users' agency, identity, and privacy. To understand how these shifts in practice, we conduct an autoethnographic study in three phases: (1) seven months of collecting all the lead author's AAC communication data, (2) fine-tuning a model on this dataset, and (3) three months of daily use of personalized AI suggestions. Observations across these phases include that logging everyday conversations reshaped the author's sense of agency, the model training selectively amplified or muted aspects of their identity, and suggestions occasionally resurfaced private details outside their original context. Our findings show that ultra-personalized AAC reshapes communication by continually renegotiating agency, identity, and privacy between user and model. We highlight design directions for building context-adaptive, user-controlled personalization AAC technology that supports expressive, authentic communication.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, "in-the-wild" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation. We publicly release all code and datasets to facilitate scalable, non-invasive monitoring of endangered species</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> |

For each neighborhood, we compute the average \emph{communicability curvature}, a graph-theoretic measure capturing the ability of a locality to influence others through multiple network paths. We integrate this metric into Negative Binomial models, fixed-effects regressions, SAR/SAC spatial models, and a hierarchical INLA/BYM2 specification. Across all frameworks, curvature is the strongest and most stable predictor of dengue risk.

The results show that dengue spread in Recife is driven less by geographic contiguity and more by network-mediated structural flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, tables</p></details> |
| **[Toward Seamless Physical Human-Humanoid Interaction: Insights from Control, Intent, and Modeling with a Vision for What Comes Next](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07765v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical Human-Humanoid Interaction (pHHI) is a rapidly advancing field with significant implications for deploying robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/xxiqiao/RL-MTJail. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful content.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |

In the past decades, it has been extended to various frameworks. The most famous are indexed linear logics which can describe the resource management or the complexity analysis of a program. From an other perspective, Differential Linear Logic is an extension which allows the linearization of proofs. In this article, we merge these two directions by first defining a differential version of Graded linear logic: this is made by indexing exponential connectives with a monoid of differential operators.

By leveraging the principle of \textit{generalized} spatial modulation (GSM), multiple receive antennas are independently activated for \textit{both} the in-phase and quadrature components of spatial symbols. To fully exploit the potential of RIS, we formulate a max-min optimization problem to adjust the phase shifts of all RIS elements, thereby maximizing the effective signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the activated antennas. Using Lagrange duality, the original high-dimensional non-convex problem is reduced to a tractable problem with a smaller number of real variables, and a closed-form suboptimal solution is also proposed, which achieves near-optimal performance with a sufficiently large RIS. At the receiver, a low-complexity non-coherent energy-based greedy detector (GD) is introduced for efficient symbol detection. We further extend the RIS-GRQSM framework to a multicast communication system, where all users receive identical information with equal SNR levels, and provide a detailed performance analysis of both systems. In particular, we derive the average bit error probability (ABEP) for the proposed RIS-GRQSM and multicast systems under optimal and suboptimal optimization strategies. Numerical results show that RIS-GRQSM significantly improves the SE and error rate performance compared with benchmark schemes, while the multicast extension achieves performance close to benchmark methods at substantially lower complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (2-column), 6 figures, 2 tables, prepared for an IEEE transaction.

Recently, the diffusion model has achieved significant advancements in the visual generation of AIGC, thereby raising an intuitive question, "whether diffusion model can boost image restoration". To answer this, some pioneering studies attempt to integrate diffusion models into the image restoration task, resulting in superior performances than previous GAN-based methods. Despite that, a comprehensive and enlightening survey on diffusion model-based image restoration remains scarce. In this paper, we are the first to present a comprehensive review of recent diffusion model-based methods on image restoration, encompassing the learning paradigm, conditional strategy, framework design, modeling strategy, and evaluation. Concretely, we first introduce the background of the diffusion model briefly and then present two prevalent workflows that exploit diffusion models in image restoration. Subsequently, we classify and emphasize the innovative designs using diffusion models for both IR and blind/real-world IR, intending to inspire future development. To evaluate existing methods thoroughly, we summarize the commonly-used dataset, implementation details, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, we present the objective comparison for open-sourced methods across three tasks, including image super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting. Ultimately, informed by the limitations in existing works, we propose five potential and challenging directions for the future research of diffusion model-based IR, including sampling efficiency, model compression, distortion simulation and estimation, distortion invariant learning, and framework design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCV 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Learning network that fuses two types of visual signals, event-based data and RGB frame data. The proposed Bimodal SegNet network has two distinct encoders, one for each signal input and a spatial pyramidal pooling with atrous convolutions. Encoders capture rich contextual information by pooling the concatenated features at different resolutions while the decoder obtains sharp object boundaries. The evaluation of the proposed method undertakes five unique image degradation challenges including occlusion, blur, brightness, trajectory and scale variance on the Event-based Segmentation (ESD) Dataset. The evaluation results show a 6-10\% segmentation accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean intersection over the union and pixel accuracy.

Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version).

However, this reuse of prior designs also leads to similar vulnerabilities across multiple processors. As processors grow increasingly complex with iterative modifications, efficiently detecting vulnerabilities from modern processors is critical. Inspired by software fuzzing, hardware fuzzing has recently demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting processor vulnerabilities. Yet, to our best knowledge, existing processor fuzzers fuzz each design individually, lacking the capability to understand known vulnerabilities in prior processors to fine-tune fuzzing to identify similar or new variants of vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present ReFuzz, an adaptive fuzzing framework that leverages contextual bandit to reuse highly effective tests from prior processors to fuzz a processor-under-test (PUT) within a given ISA. By intelligently mutating tests that trigger vulnerabilities in prior processors, ReFuzz effectively detects similar and new variants of vulnerabilities in PUTs. ReFuzz uncovered three new security vulnerabilities and two new functional bugs. ReFuzz detected one vulnerability by reusing a test that triggers a known vulnerability in a prior processor. One functional bug exists across three processors that share design modules. The second bug has two variants. Additionally, ReFuzz reuses highly effective tests to enhance efficiency in coverage, achieving an average 511.23x coverage speedup and up to 9.33% more total coverage, compared to existing fuzzers.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium, 2026</p></details> |

This objective integrates pointer-based candidate selection, rank-dependent weighting, and masked cross-entropy under vocabulary restriction, enabling stable and interpretable listwise optimization. By bridging generative modeling with discriminative ranking, our method produces coherent, fine-grained answer lists.

To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\%p improvement in CHAIR\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination.

However, training LLM agents for complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in a lower bound of the multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for long-horizon planning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)</p></details> |

This allows for a more intuitive human-computer interaction, enabling querying or editing scenes using natural language, and could potentially improve tasks like scene retrieval, navigation, and multimodal reasoning. While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation. These are processed by rendering and passing them through a multi-resolution, feature-based, hash encoder. This significantly improves efficiency both in runtime and GPU memory. Second, we introduce an Attenuated Downsampler module and propose several regularizations addressing the semantic misalignment of ground truth 2D features. We evaluate our method on the in-the-wild HolyScenes dataset and demonstrate that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025.

Drawing on the idea of ``looking broader to see the whole, looking finer to see the details," MVP is built on two core design principles: 1) a local-to-global inter-view hierarchy that gradually broadens the model's perspective from local views to groups and ultimately the full scene, and 2) a fine-to-coarse intra-view hierarchy that starts from detailed spatial representations and progressively aggregates them into compact, information-dense tokens. This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes. We validate MVP on diverse datasets and show that, when coupled with 3D Gaussian Splatting as the underlying 3D representation, it achieves state-of-the-art generalizable reconstruction quality while maintaining high efficiency and scalability across a wide range of view configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: see https://gynjn.github.io/MVP/</p></details> |
| **[Group Representational Position Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07805v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GRAPE (Group RepresentAtional Position Encoding), a unified framework for positional encoding based on group actions. GRAPE brings together two families of mechanisms: (i) multiplicative rotations (Multiplicative GRAPE) in $\mathrm{SO}(d)$ and (ii) additive logit biases (Additive GRAPE) arising from unipotent actions in the general linear group $\mathrm{GL}$. In Multiplicative GRAPE, a position $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ (or $t \in \mathbb{R}$) acts as $\mathbf{G}(n)=\exp(n\,ω\,\mathbf{L})$ with a rank-2 skew generator $\mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}$, yielding a relative, compositional, norm-preserving map with a closed-form matrix exponential. RoPE is recovered exactly when the $d/2$ planes are the canonical coordinate pairs with log-uniform spectrum. Learned commuting subspaces and compact non-commuting mixtures strictly extend this geometry to capture cross-subspace feature coupling at $O(d)$ and $O(r d)$ cost per head, respectively. In Additive GRAPE, additive logits arise as rank-1 (or low-rank) unipotent actions, recovering ALiBi and the Forgetting Transformer (FoX) as exact special cases while preserving an exact relative law and streaming cacheability. Altogether, GRAPE supplies a principled design space for positional geometry in long-context models, subsuming RoPE and ALiBi as special cases.

This can be mitigated by delaying full charging \ours until just before departure, which requires accurate prediction of user departure times. In this work, we propose Transformer-based real-time-to-event (TTE) model for accurate EV departure prediction. Our approach represents each day as a TTE sequence by discretizing time into grid-based tokens. Unlike previous methods primarily dependent on temporal dependency from historical patterns, our method leverages streaming contextual information to predict departures. Evaluation on a real-world study involving 93 users and passive smartphone data demonstrates that our method effectively captures irregular departure patterns within individual routines, outperforming baseline models. These results highlight the potential for practical deployment of the \ours algorithm and its contribution to sustainable transportation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, AAAI'26 (accepted)</p></details> |

Despite their remarkable performance, many challenges remain in training deep transformer networks, especially regarding the position of the layer normalization. While Pre-Norm structures facilitate more stable training owing to their stronger identity path, they often lead to suboptimal performance compared to Post-Norm. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{HybridNorm}$, a simple yet effective hybrid normalization strategy that integrates the advantages of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm. Specifically, HybridNorm employs QKV normalization within the attention mechanism and Post-Norm in the feed-forward network (FFN) of each transformer block. We provide both theoretical insights and empirical evidence to demonstrate that HybridNorm improves the gradient flow and the model robustness. Extensive experiments on large-scale transformer models, including both dense and sparse variants, show that HybridNorm consistently outperforms both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm approaches across multiple benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of HybridNorm as a more stable and effective technique for improving the training and performance of deep transformer models.

Yet, these models often rely on relaxed Bayesian assumptions, omitting critical uncertainty information needed for robust decision-making. Despite growing interest in probabilistic segmentation to address point-estimate limitations, the research landscape remains fragmented. In response, this review synthesizes foundational concepts in uncertainty modeling, analyzing how feature- and parameter-distribution modeling impact four key segmentation tasks: Observer Variability, Active Learning, Model Introspection, and Model Generalization. Our work establishes a common framework by standardizing theory, notation, and terminology, thereby bridging the gap between method developers, task specialists, and applied researchers. We then discuss critical challenges, including the nuanced distinction between uncertainty types, strong assumptions in spatial aggregation, the lack of standardized benchmarks, and pitfalls in current quantification methods. We identify promising avenues for future research, such as uncertainty-aware active learning, data-driven benchmarks, transformer-based models, and novel techniques to move from simple segmentation problems to uncertainty in holistic scene understanding. Based on our analysis, we offer practical guidelines for researchers on method selection, evaluation, reproducibility, and meaningful uncertainty estimation. Ultimately, our goal is to facilitate the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable segmentation models that can be confidently deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> | TMLR |

We focus on the primitive variant, where each relay observes a noisy version of the source signal and forwards a compressed description over an orthogonal, noiseless, finite-rate link to the destination. Compress-and-forward (CF) is particularly effective in this setting, especially under oblivious relaying where relays lack access to the source codebook. While neural CF methods have been studied in single-relay channels, extending them to the two-relay case is non-trivial, as it requires fully distributed compression without any inter-relay coordination. We demonstrate that learning-based quantizers at the relays can harness input correlations by operating remote, yet in a collaborative fashion, enabling effective distributed compression in line with Berger-Tung-style coding. Each relay separately compresses its observation using a one-shot learned quantizer, and the destination jointly decodes the source message. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme, trained end-to-end with finite-order modulation, operates close to the known theoretical bounds. These results demonstrate that neural CF can scale to multi-relay systems while maintaining both performance and interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 59th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</p></details> |

In-memory computing (IMC) with RRAM provides a promising alternative by providing analog computations with significant gains in latency and energy use. However, existing algorithms developed for conventional architectures do not translate to IMC, particularly for constrained optimization problems where frequent matrix reprogramming remains cost-prohibitive for IMC applications. Here we present a distributed in-memory primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, specifically co-designed for arrays of RRAM devices. Our approach minimizes costly write cycles, incorporates robustness against device non-idealities, and leverages a symmetric block-matrix formulation to unify operations across distributed crossbars. We integrate a physics-based simulation framework called MELISO+ to evaluate performance under realistic device conditions. Benchmarking against GPU-accelerated solvers on large-scale linear programs demonstrates that our RRAM-based solver achieves comparable accuracy with up to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy consumption and latency. These results demonstrate the first PDHG-based LP solver implemented on RRAMs, showcasing the transformative potential of algorithm-hardware co-design for solving large-scale optimization through distributed in-memory computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main Article (14 Pages, 3 Figures), Appendix (5 Pages) Accepted for presentation at SIAM PP26</p></details> |

This paper studies the inclusion of predefined chord constraints in melodic harmonization, i.e., where a desired chord at a specific location is provided along with the melody as inputs and the autoregressive transformer model needs to incorporate the chord in the harmonization that it generates. The peculiarities of involving such constraints is discussed and an algorithm is proposed for tackling this task. This algorithm is called B* and it combines aspects of beam search and A* along with backtracking to force pretrained transformers to satisfy the chord constraints, at the correct onset position within the correct bar. The algorithm is brute-force and has exponential complexity in the worst case; however, this paper is a first attempt to highlight the difficulties of the problem and proposes an algorithm that offers many possibilities for improvements since it accommodates the involvement of heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 6th Conference on AI Music Creativity (AIMC 2025), Brussels, Belgium, September 10th-12th</p></details> |

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

While most adhere to open-source licenses, some falsely claim original training despite clear derivation from public models, raising pressing concerns about intellectual property protection and the need to verify model provenance. In this paper, we propose GhostSpec, a lightweight yet effective method for verifying LLM lineage without access to training data or modification of model behavior. Our approach constructs compact and robust fingerprints by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to invariant products of internal attention weight matrices. Unlike watermarking or output-based methods, GhostSpec is fully data-free, non-invasive, and computationally efficient. Extensive experiments show it is robust to fine-tuning, pruning, expansion, and adversarial transformations, reliably tracing lineage with minimal overhead. By offering a practical solution for model verification, our method contributes to intellectual property protection and fosters a transparent, trustworthy LLM ecosystem.

| **[On Conditional Independence Graph Learning From Multi-Attribute Gaussian Dependent Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07557v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimation of the conditional independence graph (CIG) of high-dimensional multivariate Gaussian time series from multi-attribute data is considered. Existing methods for graph estimation for such data are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar time series with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector or vector time series. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning for dependent time series using a penalized log-likelihood objective function formulated in the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform of the time-domain data. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and non-convex (log-sum and SCAD group penalties) penalty/regularization functions. We establish sufficient conditions in a high-dimensional setting for consistency (convergence of the inverse power spectral density to true value in the Frobenius norm), local convexity when using non-convex penalties, and graph recovery. We do not impose any incoherence or irrepresentability condition for our convergence results. We also empirically investigate selection of the tuning parameters based on the Bayesian information criterion, and illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, EMMA primarily consists of 1) An efficient autoencoder with a 32x compression ratio, which significantly reduces the number of tokens required for generation. This also ensures the training balance between understanding and generation tasks by applying the same compression ratio to images. 2) Channel-wise concatenation instead of token-wise concatenation among visual understanding and generation tokens, which further reduces the visual tokens in unified architectures. 3) A shared-and-decoupled network that enables mutual improvements across tasks while meeting the task-specific modeling requirements. 4) A mixture-of-experts mechanism adopted for visual understanding encoder, which substantially improves perceptual capabilities with a few parameters increase. Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image). We believe that EMMA lays a solid foundation for the future development of unified multimodal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://emma-umm.github.io/emma/</p></details> |

SiLMs couple strong syntactic generalization behavior with competitive performance on various NLP tasks, but many of their basic properties are yet underexplored. In this work, we train three different SiLM architectures from scratch: Structformer (Shen et al., 2021), UDGN (Shen et al., 2022), and GPST (Hu et al., 2024b). We train these architectures on both natural language (English, German, and Chinese) corpora and synthetic bracketing expressions. The models are then evaluated with respect to (i) properties of the induced syntactic representations (ii) performance on grammaticality judgment tasks, and (iii) training dynamics. We find that none of the three architectures dominates across all evaluation metrics. However, there are significant differences, in particular with respect to the induced syntactic representations. The Generative Pretrained Structured Transformer (GPST; Hu et al. 2024) performs most consistently across evaluation settings, and outperforms the other models on long-distance dependencies in bracketing expressions. Furthermore, our study shows that small models trained on large amounts of synthetic data provide a useful testbed for evaluating basic model properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/davidarps/silm</p></details> |

By flattening graphs into random sequences of tokens through a reversible process, AutoGraph enables modeling graphs as sequences without relying on additional node features that are expensive to compute, in contrast to diffusion-based approaches. This results in sampling complexity and sequence lengths that scale optimally linearly with the number of edges, making it scalable and efficient for large, sparse graphs. A key success factor of AutoGraph is that its sequence prefixes represent induced subgraphs, creating a direct link to sub-sentences in language modeling. Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and molecular benchmarks, with up to 100x faster generation and 3x faster training than leading diffusion models. It also supports substructure-conditioned generation without fine-tuning and shows promising transferability, bridging language modeling and graph generation to lay the groundwork for graph foundation models.

It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 4 equations</p></details> |

This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity and spatial localization, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is Band-Localized Activation (BLA), a novel activation designed for joint frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). Through structured frequency control and spatially localized responses, BLA effectively mitigates spectral bias and enhances training stability. The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network, enabling precise frequency selection and adaptive band control. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation, as well as 3D shape reconstruction and novel view synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our project page at https://cmlab-korea.github.io/FLAIR/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust DeepFake Detection under Unstable Face Sequences: Adaptive Sparse Graph Embedding with Order-Free Representation and Explicit Laplacian Spectral Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07498v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the authenticity of video content remains challenging as DeepFake generation becomes increasingly realistic and robust against detection. Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues. Extensive experiments on FF++, Celeb-DFv2, and DFDC demonstrate that LR-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved robustness under severe global and local disruptions, including missing faces, occlusions, and adversarially perturbed face detections.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (including appendix)</p></details> |

While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterised by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well-supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a workflow for transforming such documents into structured data using a combination of multimodal large language models (LLMs), an ontology-based reasoning model, and a custom extension of the Linked Art framework. We show how vision-language models can accurately parse and transcribe born-digital and digitised programmes, achieving over 98% of correct extraction. To overcome the challenges of semantic annotation, we train a reasoning model (POntAvignon) using reinforcement learning with both formal and semantic rewards. This approach enables automated RDF triple generation and supports alignment with existing knowledge graphs. Through a case study based on the Festival d'Avignon corpus, we demonstrate the potential for large-scale, ontology-driven analysis of performing arts data. Our results open new possibilities for interoperable, explainable, and sustainable computational theatre historiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, 17 references</p></details> |

In RecSys, the retrieval stage is also follows a 'next-token prediction' paradigm, to recall the hunderds of items from the global item set, thus the generative recommendation usually refers specifically to the retrieval stage (without Tree-based methods). This raises a philosophical question: without a ground-truth next item, does the generative recommendation also holds a potential scaling law? In retrospect, the generative recommendation has two different technique paradigms: (1) ANN-based framework, utilizing the compressed user embedding to retrieve nearest other items in embedding space, e.g, Kuaiformer. (2) Auto-regressive-based framework, employing the beam search to decode the item from whole space, e.g, OneRec. In this paper, we devise a unified encoder-decoder framework to validate their scaling-laws at same time. Our empirical finding is that both of their losses strictly adhere to power-law Scaling Laws ($R^2$>0.9) within our unified architecture.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, existing methods are largely confined to single-agent scenarios, overlooking the physically plausible interplay essential for multi-agent interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose InterAgent, the first end-to-end framework for text-driven physics-based multi-agent humanoid control. At its core, we introduce an autoregressive diffusion transformer equipped with multi-stream blocks, which decouples proprioception, exteroception, and action to mitigate cross-modal interference while enabling synergistic coordination. We further propose a novel interaction graph exteroception representation that explicitly captures fine-grained joint-to-joint spatial dependencies to facilitate network learning. Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterAgent consistently outperforms multiple strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It enables producing coherent, physically plausible, and semantically faithful multi-agent behaviors from only text prompts.

A Million-Scale Benchmark and New Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07385v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism. We conduct experiments on the UAV-Anti-UAV dataset to validate the effectiveness of our method. A thorough experimental evaluation of 50 modern deep tracking algorithms demonstrates that there is still significant room for improvement in the UAV-Anti-UAV domain.

A fundamental challenge in deep hashing stems from the discrete nature of quantization in generating the codes. W-type regularizations, such as $||z|-1|$, have been proven effective as they encourage variables toward binary values. However, existing methods often directly optimize these regularizations without convergence guarantees. While proximal gradient methods offer a promising solution, the coupling between W-type regularizers and neural network outputs results in composite forms that generally lack closed-form proximal solutions. In this paper, we present a stochastic primal-dual hashing algorithm, referred to as DualHash, that provides rigorous complexity bounds. Using Fenchel duality, we partially transform the nonconvex W-type regularization optimization into the dual space, which results in a proximal operator that admits closed-form solutions. We derive two algorithm instances: a momentum-accelerated version with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ complexity and an improved $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ version using variance reduction. Experiments on three image retrieval databases demonstrate the superior performance of DualHash.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |

In particular, deep network models, widely used for health data processing, encode information from their training dataset, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information upon its export. This paper thoroughly examines this issue in the context of medical imaging data and introduces a novel data exfiltration attack based on image compression techniques. This attack, termed Data Exfiltration by Compression, requires only access to a data lake and is based on lossless or lossy image compression methods. Unlike previous data exfiltration attacks, it is compatible with any image processing task and depends solely on an exported network model without requiring any additional information to be collected during the training process. We explore various scenarios, and techniques to limit the size of the exported model and conceal the compression codes within the network. Using two public datasets of CT and MR images, we demonstrate that this attack can effectively steal medical images and reconstruct them outside the data lake with high fidelity, achieving an optimal balance between compression and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we investigate the impact of basic differential privacy measures, such as adding Gaussian noise to the model parameters, to prevent the Data Exfiltration by Compression Attack. We also show how the attacker can make their attack resilient to differential privacy at the expense of decreasing the number of stolen images. Lastly, we propose an alternative prevention strategy by fine-tuning the model to be exported.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:032</p></details> |

In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged. To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2026; code available at https://github.com/2019ChenGong/PrivORL</p></details> |

However, bond prices often move in the opposite direction to economic optimism, making general or equity-based sentiment tools potentially misleading. We introduce BondBERT, a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on bond-specific news. BondBERT can act as the perception and reasoning component of a financial decision-support agent, providing sentiment signals that integrate with forecasting models. We propose a generalisable framework for adapting transformers to low-volatility, domain-inverse sentiment tasks by compiling and cleaning 30,000 UK bond market articles (2018-2025). BondBERT's sentiment predictions are compared against FinBERT, FinGPT, and Instruct-FinGPT using event-based correlation, up/down accuracy analyses, and LSTM forecasting across ten UK sovereign bonds. We find that BondBERT consistently produces positive correlations with bond returns, and achieves higher alignment and forecasting accuracy than the three baseline models. These results demonstrate that domain-specific sentiment adaptation better captures fixed income dynamics, bridging a gap between NLP advances and bond market analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, author manuscript accepted for ICAART 2026: 18th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence, Mar. 2026, Marbella, Spain</p></details> |

Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48%, 93.05%, 93.63%, 92.48%, 94.93% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14%, 92.21%, 94.35%, 90.10%, 95.12% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13% accuracy, 74.25% UAR, 86.47% sensitivity, 62.04% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 37 figures, 19 tables</p></details> |

Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning. We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning. IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA* use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version of HA* (HA*M, an internal baseline). In simulated off- road experiments in a high-fidelity simulator, IGHA* outper- forms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex dynamics.

Drawing on the idea of ``looking broader to see the whole, looking finer to see the details," MVP is built on two core design principles: 1) a local-to-global inter-view hierarchy that gradually broadens the model's perspective from local views to groups and ultimately the full scene, and 2) a fine-to-coarse intra-view hierarchy that starts from detailed spatial representations and progressively aggregates them into compact, information-dense tokens. This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes. We validate MVP on diverse datasets and show that, when coupled with 3D Gaussian Splatting as the underlying 3D representation, it achieves state-of-the-art generalizable reconstruction quality while maintaining high efficiency and scalability across a wide range of view configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: see https://gynjn.github.io/MVP/</p></details> |
| **[Large Causal Models from Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07796v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new paradigm for building large causal models (LCMs) that exploits the enormous potential latent in today's large language models (LLMs). We describe our ongoing experiments with an implemented system called DEMOCRITUS (Decentralized Extraction of Manifold Ontologies of Causal Relations Integrating Topos Universal Slices) aimed at building, organizing, and visualizing LCMs that span disparate domains extracted from carefully targeted textual queries to LLMs. DEMOCRITUS is methodologically distinct from traditional narrow domain and hypothesis centered causal inference that builds causal models from experiments that produce numerical data. A high-quality LLM is used to propose topics, generate causal questions, and extract plausible causal statements from a diverse range of domains. The technical challenge is then to take these isolated, fragmented, potentially ambiguous and possibly conflicting causal claims, and weave them into a coherent whole, converting them into relational causal triples and embedding them into a LCM. Addressing this technical challenge required inventing new categorical machine learning methods, which we can only briefly summarize in this paper, as it is focused more on the systems side of building DEMOCRITUS. We describe the implementation pipeline for DEMOCRITUS comprising of six modules, examine its computational cost profile to determine where the current bottlenecks in scaling the system to larger models. We describe the results of using DEMOCRITUS over a wide range of domains, spanning archaeology, biology, climate change, economics, medicine and technology.

In this review, we examine the current state of the art in pHHI through three core pillars: (i) humanoid modeling and control, (ii) human intent estimation, and (iii) computational human models. For each pillar, we survey representative approaches, identify open challenges, and analyze current limitations that hinder robust, scalable, and adaptive interaction. These include the need for whole-body control strategies capable of handling uncertain human dynamics, real-time intent inference under limited sensing, and modeling techniques that account for variability in human physical states. Although significant progress has been made within each domain, integration across pillars remains limited. We propose pathways for unifying methods across these areas to enable cohesive interaction frameworks. This structure enables us not only to map the current landscape but also to propose concrete directions for future research that aim to bridge these domains. Additionally, we introduce a unified taxonomy of interaction types based on modality, distinguishing between direct interactions (e.g., physical contact) and indirect interactions (e.g., object-mediated), and on the level of robot engagement, ranging from assistance to cooperation and collaboration. For each category in this taxonomy, we provide the three core pillars that highlight opportunities for cross-pillar unification. Our goal is to suggest avenues to advance robust, safe, and intuitive physical interaction, providing a roadmap for future research that will allow humanoid systems to effectively understand, anticipate, and collaborate with human partners in diverse real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The project code is available at https://github.com/Nicolas-Yax/PhyloLM .

Although many platforms attempt to curb incivility through moderation and automated detection, the performance of existing approaches often remains limited in both accuracy and efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for detecting three types of uncivil behavior (i.e., toxicity, aggression, and personal attacks) within the English Wikipedia community. Our model represents each user comment as a node, with textual similarity between comments defining the edges, allowing the network to jointly learn from both linguistic content and relational structures among comments. We also introduce a dynamically adjusted attention mechanism that adaptively balances nodal and topological features during information aggregation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms 12 state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple metrics while requiring significantly lower inference cost. These findings highlight the crucial role of structural context in detecting online incivility and address the limitations of text-only LLM paradigms in behavioral prediction. All datasets and comparative outputs will be publicly available in our repository to support further research and reproducibility.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, the performance of the latter is often capped by the former. To circumvent this dilemma, we propose DMDR, a novel framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques into the distillation process. We show that for the RL of the few-step generator, the DMD loss itself is a more effective regularization compared to the traditional ones. In turn, RL can help to guide the mode coverage process in DMD more effectively. These allow us to unlock the capacity of the few-step generator by conducting distillation and RL simultaneously. Meanwhile, we design the dynamic distribution guidance and dynamic renoise sampling training strategies to improve the initial distillation process. The experiments demonstrate that DMDR can achieve leading visual quality, prompt coherence among few-step methods, and even exhibit performance that exceeds the multi-step teacher.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The synergy of reinforcement learning and distribution matching distillation.

We propose a latent variable model for drawing statistical inferences on covariate effects and predicting future outcomes based on high-dimensional multivariate longitudinal data. This model introduces unobserved factors to account for the between-variable and across-time dependence and assist the prediction. Statistical inference and prediction tools are developed under a general setting that allows outcome variables to be of mixed types and possibly unobserved for certain time points, for example, due to right censoring. A central limit theorem is established for drawing statistical inferences on regression coefficients. Additionally, an information criterion is introduced to choose the number of factors. The proposed model is applied to customer grocery shopping records to predict and understand shopping behavior.</p></details> | 117 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Semantic Faithfulness and Entropy Production Measures to Tame Your LLM Demons and Manage Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05156v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\bf Q}$ and ${\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Natur...</summary><p>Nature Communications (2025)</p></details> |

Despite significant recent efforts, machine performance in the wild remains nonviable, and the reasoning processes underlying this performance are opaque. As such, we extend PMD to require generating visual self-dialog rationales to inform decisions. Given the impressive, mature image understanding capabilities observed in recent vision-and-language models (VLMs), we curate a suitable benchmark dataset for PMD based on individual frames. As our reformulation enables unprecedented transparency, we leverage a natural language inference (NLI) model to formulate two automated metrics for the coherence of generated rationales. We establish baselines for this reframed task, showing that VLMs struggle off-the-shelf, but with some trade-offs, their accuracy, coherence, and efficiency can be improved by incorporating these metrics into common inference and fine-tuning methods. Lastly, our multi-faceted metrics visualize common outcomes, highlighting areas for further improvement.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100% navigation success and 0.09s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for publication and is currently under review</p></details> |

Given a trained model and an evaluation dataset, $φ$-test performs SHAP-guided screening and fits a linear surrogate on the screened features via a selection rule with a tractable selective-inference form. For each retained feature, it outputs a Shapley-based global score, a surrogate coefficient, and post-selection $p$-values and confidence intervals in a global feature-importance table. Experiments on real tabular regression tasks with tree-based and neural backbones suggest that $φ$-test can retain much of the predictive ability of the original model while using only a few features and producing feature sets that remain fairly stable across resamples and backbone classes. In these settings, $φ$-test acts as a practical global explanation layer linking Shapley-based importance summaries with classical statistical inference.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, the high energy and latency overhead induced by the KV cache limits the edge deployment, especially for long contexts. Emerging hybrid bonding (HB) technology has been proposed as a promising alternative to conventional near-memory processing (NMP) architectures, offering improved bandwidth efficiency and lower power consumption while exhibiting characteristics of distributed memory. In this paper, we propose H2EAL, a hybrid bonding-based accelerator with sparse attention algorithm-hardware co-design for efficient LLM inference at the edge. At the algorithm level, we propose a hybrid sparse attention scheme with static and dynamic sparsity for different heads to fully leverage the sparsity with high accuracy. At the hardware level, we co-design the hardware to support hybrid sparse attention and propose memory-compute co-placement to address the distributed memory bottleneck. Since different attention heads exhibit different sparse patterns and the attention structure often mismatches the HB architecture, we further develop a load-balancing scheduler with parallel tiled attention to address workload imbalance and optimize the mapping strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate H2EAL achieves 5.20~48.21x speedup and 6.22~73.48x energy efficiency improvement over baseline HB implementation, with a negligible average accuracy drop of 0.87% on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> |

Most popular methods for rank-order data postulate a linear specification for the latent scores, which determine the observed ranks, and ignore the temporal dependence of the ranking lists. To address these issues, novel nonparametric static (ROBART) and autoregressive (ARROBART) models are developed, with latent scores defined as nonlinear Bayesian additive regression tree functions of covariates. To make inferences in the dynamic ARROBART model, closed-form filtering, predictive, and smoothing distributions for the latent time-varying scores are derived. These results are applied in a Gibbs sampler with data augmentation for posterior inference. The proposed methods are shown to outperform existing competitors in simulation studies, static data applications to electoral data, stated preferences for sushi and movies, and dynamic data applications to economic complexity rankings of countries and weekly pollster rankings of NCAA football teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>The S...</summary><p>The Supplementary Material is available upon request to the authors</p></details> |
| **[MCMoE: Completing Missing Modalities with Mixture of Experts for Incomplete Multimodal Action Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17397v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Action Quality Assessment (AQA) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm. By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MCMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in both complete and incomplete multimodal learning on three public AQA benchmarks.

| **[Fast training and sampling of Restricted Boltzmann Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15376v3)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting insights from data, but their training is hindered by the slow mixing of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) processes, especially with highly structured datasets. In this study, we build on recent theoretical advances in RBM training and focus on the stepwise encoding of data patterns into singular vectors of the coupling matrix, significantly reducing the cost of generating new samples and evaluating the quality of the model, as well as the training cost in highly clustered datasets. The learning process is analogous to the thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. We leverage the continuous transitions in the training process to define a smooth annealing trajectory that enables reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimates. This approach enables online assessment during training and introduces a novel sampling strategy called Parallel Trajectory Tempering (PTT) that outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. To mitigate the critical slowdown effect in the early stages of training, we propose a pre-training phase. In this phase, the principal components are encoded into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process, facilitating efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. Our results demonstrate that this pre-training strategy allows RBMs to efficiently handle highly structured datasets where conventional methods fail. Additionally, our log-likelihood estimation outperforms computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios, while the PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 16 figures |

While neural network-based models have achieved notable success in this domain, complex channel-dependent models often suffer from performance degradation compared to channel-independent models that do not consider the relationship between components but provide high robustness due to small capacity. In this work, we propose HN-MVTS, a novel architecture that integrates a hypernetwork-based generative prior with an arbitrary neural network forecasting model. The input of this hypernetwork is a learnable embedding matrix of time series components. To restrict the number of new parameters, the hypernetwork learns to generate the weights of the last layer of the target forecasting networks, serving as a data-adaptive regularizer that improves generalization and long-range predictive accuracy. The hypernetwork is used only during the training, so it does not increase the inference time compared to the base forecasting model. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that application of HN-MVTS to the state-of-the-art models (DLinear, PatchTST, TSMixer, etc.) typically improves their performance. Our findings suggest that hypernetwork-driven parameterization offers a promising direction for enhancing existing forecasting techniques in complex scenarios.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

However, enabling them to "forget" designated information remains challenging, especially under privacy regulations such as the GDPR. Existing unlearning methods largely optimize for efficiency and scalability, yet they offer little transparency, and the black-box nature of GNNs makes it difficult to verify whether forgetting has truly occurred. We propose an explainability-driven verifier for GNN unlearning that snapshots the model before and after deletion, using attribution shifts and localized structural changes (for example, graph edit distance) as transparent evidence. The verifier uses five explainability metrics: residual attribution, heatmap shift, explainability score deviation, graph edit distance, and a diagnostic graph rule shift. We evaluate two backbones (GCN, GAT) and four unlearning strategies (Retrain, GraphEditor, GNNDelete, IDEA) across five benchmarks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Coauthor-CS, Coauthor-Physics). Results show that Retrain and GNNDelete achieve near-complete forgetting, GraphEditor provides partial erasure, and IDEA leaves residual signals. These explanation deltas provide the primary, human-readable evidence of forgetting; we also report membership-inference ROC-AUC as a complementary, graph-wide privacy signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in WSDM 2026 (ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining).

DNNs are often partitioned and executed across heterogeneous processing units to optimize latency and energy. However, the reliability of these partitioned models under hardware faults and communication errors remains a critical yet underexplored topic, especially in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we propose an accuracy-aware, fault-resilient DNN partitioning framework targeting multi-objective optimization using NSGA-II, where accuracy degradation under fault conditions is introduced as a core metric alongside energy and latency. Our framework performs runtime fault injection during optimization and utilizes a feedback loop to prioritize fault-tolerant partitioning. We evaluate our approach on benchmark CNNs including AlexNet, SqueezeNet and ResNet18 on hardware accelerators, and demonstrate up to 27.7% improvement in fault tolerance with minimal increase in performance overhead. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating resilience into DNN partitioning, and thereby paving the way for robust AI inference in error-prone environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Concurrently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering superior parameter efficiency and interpretability. To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning. Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed.

However, in the large majority of these applications, model checking is only used at the very end, when no counterexample can be found anymore for the latest hypothesis model. This contrasts with the original proposal of black-box checking (BBC) by Peled, Vardi & Yannakakis, which applies model checking for all hypotheses, also the intermediate ones. In this article, we present the first systematic evaluation of the ability of BBC to find bugs quickly, based on 77 benchmarks models from real protocol implementations and controllers for which specifications of safety properties are available. Our main finding are: (a) In cases where the full model can be learned, BBC detects violations of the specifications with just 3.4% of the queries needed by an approach in which model checking is only used for the full model. (b) Even when the full model cannot be learned, BBC is still able to detect many violations of the specification. In particular, BBC manages to detect 94% of the safety properties violations in the challenging RERS 2019 industrial LTL benchmarks. (c) Our results also confirm that BBC is way more effective than existing MBT algorithms in finding deep bugs in implementations.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

Language models frequently produce unreliable reasoning with plausible but incorrect solutions that are difficult to verify. To address this, we investigate fine-tuning models to use Prolog as an external tool for verifiable computation. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we fine-tune Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on a cleaned GSM8K-Prolog-Prover dataset while varying (i) prompt structure, (ii) reward composition (execution, syntax, semantics, structure), and (iii) inference protocol: single-shot, best-of-N, and two agentic modes where Prolog is invoked internally or independently. Our reinforcement learning approach outperforms supervised fine-tuning, with our 3B model achieving zero-shot MMLU performance comparable to 7B few-shot results. Our findings reveal that: 1) joint tuning of prompt, reward, and inference shapes program syntax and logic; 2) best-of-N with external Prolog verification maximizes accuracy on GSM8K; 3) agentic inference with internal repair yields superior zero-shot generalization on MMLU-Stem and MMLU-Pro. These results demonstrate that grounding model reasoning in formal verification systems substantially improves reliability and auditability for safety-critical applications.

Such models have primarily been seen through the lens of interpretability so far, wherein they offer transparency by inferring predictions as a linear combination of semantic concepts. However, a linear combination is inherently limiting. So we propose the enhancement of concept-based learning models through propositional logic. We introduce a logic module that is carefully designed to connect the learned concepts from CBMs through differentiable logic operations, such that our proposed LogicCBM can go beyond simple weighted combinations of concepts to leverage various logical operations to yield the final predictions, while maintaining end-to-end learnability. Composing concepts using a set of logic operators enables the model to capture inter-concept relations, while simultaneously improving the expressivity of the model in terms of logic operations. Our empirical studies on well-known benchmarks and synthetic datasets demonstrate that these models have better accuracy, perform effective interventions and are highly interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 19 figures, WACV 2026</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol, the global industry standard for smart home communication, SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 16 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals distinct capabilities and limitations across models. Models under 7B parameters exhibited negligible performance across all query types. Even GPT-4.1, the best-performing standard model, struggled with implicit intent inference, state verification, and particularly temporal scheduling. While reasoning models such as GPT-5.1 consistently outperformed standard models on every query type, they required over three times the average inference time, which can be prohibitive for real-time smart home applications. This highlights a critical trade-off between task performance and real-world practicality.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Equivariant Diffusion for Crystal Structure Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07289v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In addressing the challenge of Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), symmetry-aware deep learning models, particularly diffusion models, have been extensively studied, which treat CSP as a conditional generation task. However, ensuring permutation, rotation, and periodic translation equivariance during diffusion process remains incompletely addressed. In this work, we propose EquiCSP, a novel equivariant diffusion-based generative model. We not only address the overlooked issue of lattice permutation equivariance in existing models, but also develop a unique noising algorithm that rigorously maintains periodic translation equivariance throughout both training and inference processes. Our experiments indicate that EquiCSP significantly surpasses existing models in terms of generating accurate structures and demonstrates faster convergence during the training process.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Geo3DVQA: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for 3D Geospatial Reasoning from Aerial Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07276v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Three-dimensional geospatial analysis is critical to applications in urban planning, climate adaptation, and environmental assessment. Current methodologies depend on costly, specialized sensors (e.g., LiDAR and multispectral), which restrict global accessibility. Existing sensor-based and rule-driven methods further struggle with tasks requiring the integration of multiple 3D cues, handling diverse queries, and providing interpretable reasoning. We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning. GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved only 28.6% and 33.0% accuracy respectively, while domain-specific fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieved 49.6% (+24.8 points). These results reveal both the limitations of current VLMs and the effectiveness of domain adaptation. Geo3DVQA introduces new challenge frontiers for scalable, accessible, and holistic 3D geospatial analysis. The dataset and code will be released upon publication at https://github.com/mm1129/Geo3DVQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

| **[Splannequin: Freezing Monocular Mannequin-Challenge Footage with Dual-Detection Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05113v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

| **[DiTAR: Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling for Speech Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03930v4)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several recent studies have attempted to autoregressively generate continuous speech representations without discrete speech tokens by combining diffusion and autoregressive models, yet they often face challenges with excessive computational loads or suboptimal outcomes. In this work, we propose Diffusion Transformer Autoregressive Modeling (DiTAR), a patch-based autoregressive framework combining a language model with a diffusion transformer. This approach significantly enhances the efficacy of autoregressive models for continuous tokens and reduces computational demands. DiTAR utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy for patch generation, where the language model processes aggregated patch embeddings and the diffusion transformer subsequently generates the next patch based on the output of the language model. For inference, we propose defining temperature as the time point of introducing noise during the reverse diffusion ODE to balance diversity and determinism. We also show in the extensive scaling analysis that DiTAR has superb scalability. In zero-shot speech generation, DiTAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness, speaker similarity, and naturalness.</p></details> | <details><summary>ByteD...</summary><p>ByteDance Seed template, ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[MUST-RAG: MUSical Text Question Answering with Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23334v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an earlier version of the paper - ArtistMus: A Globally Diverse, Artist-Centric Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Music Question Answering.

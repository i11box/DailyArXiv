| **[TimeSearch-R: Adaptive Temporal Search for Long-Form Video Understanding via Self-Verification Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05489v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL). However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV, filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably, TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1% improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video reasoning model Video-R1.

| **[MIMIC-SR-ICD11: A Dataset for Narrative-Based Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05485v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease. Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates semantic compatibility from label frequency bias.</p></details> | 19 |
| **[FedFACT: A Provable Framework for Controllable Group-Fairness Calibration in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03777v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emerging application of Federated Learning (FL) in decision-making scenarios, it is imperative to regulate model fairness to prevent disparities across sensitive groups (e.g., female, male). Current research predominantly focuses on two concepts of group fairness within FL: Global Fairness (overall model disparity across all clients) and Local Fairness (the disparity within each client). However, the non-decomposable, non-differentiable nature of fairness criteria poses two fundamental, unresolved challenges for fair FL: (i) Harmonizing global and local fairness, especially in multi-class setting; (ii) Enabling a controllable, optimal accuracy-fairness trade-off. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel controllable federated group-fairness calibration framework, named FedFACT. FedFACT identifies the Bayes-optimal classifiers under both global and local fairness constraints, yielding models with minimal performance decline while guaranteeing fairness. Building on the characterization of the optimal fair classifiers, we reformulate fair federated learning as a personalized cost-sensitive learning problem for in-processing and a bi-level optimization for post-processing. Theoretically, we provide convergence and generalization guarantees for FedFACT to approach the near-optimal accuracy under given fairness levels. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various data heterogeneity demonstrate that FedFACT consistently outperforms baselines in balancing accuracy and global-local fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tactical Decision Making for Autonomous Trucks by Deep Reinforcement Learning with Total Cost of Operation Based Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06524v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework for tactical decision making in an autonomous truck, specifically for Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lane change maneuvers in a highway scenario. Our results demonstrate that it is beneficial to separate high-level decision-making processes and low-level control actions between the reinforcement learning agent and the low-level controllers based on physical models. In the following, we study optimizing the performance with a realistic and multi-objective reward function based on Total Cost of Operation (TCOP) of the truck using different approaches; by adding weights to reward components, by normalizing the reward components and by using curriculum learning techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper is accepted for publication in Artificial Intelligence Review</p></details> |
| **[TRACE: Textual Relevance Augmentation and Contextual Encoding for Multimodal Hate Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17902v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media memes are a challenging domain for hate detection because they intertwine visual and textual cues into culturally nuanced messages. To tackle these challenges, we introduce TRACE, a hierarchical multimodal framework that leverages visually grounded context augmentation, along with a novel caption-scoring network to emphasize hate-relevant content, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of CLIP's text encoder. Our experiments demonstrate that selectively fine-tuning deeper text encoder layers significantly enhances performance compared to simpler projection-layer fine-tuning methods. Specifically, our framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (0.807) and F1-score (0.806) on the widely-used Hateful Memes dataset, matching the performance of considerably larger models while maintaining efficiency. Moreover, it achieves superior generalization on the MultiOFF offensive meme dataset (F1-score 0.673), highlighting robustness across meme categories. Additional analyses confirm that robust visual grounding and nuanced text representations significantly reduce errors caused by benign confounders. We publicly release our code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Special Track on AI for Social Impact (AISI) at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Metamorphic Testing Perspective on Knowledge Distillation for Language Models of Code: Does the Student Deeply Mimic the Teacher?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05476v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |
| **[Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 16 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Explainable Fake Image Detection with Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14245v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Progress in image generation raises significant public security concerns. We argue that fake image detection should not operate as a "black box". Instead, an ideal approach must ensure both strong generalization and transparency. Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offers new opportunities for reasoning-based AI-generated image detection. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in comparison to traditional detection methods and human evaluators, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we design six distinct prompts and propose a framework that integrates these prompts to develop a more robust, explainable, and reasoning-driven detection system. The code is available at https://github.com/Gennadiyev/mllm-defake.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025; 14 pages including Appendix</p></details> |
| **[To Word Senses and Beyond: Inducing Concepts with Contextualized Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20054v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polysemy and synonymy are two crucial interrelated facets of lexical ambiguity. While both phenomena are widely documented in lexical resources and have been studied extensively in NLP, leading to dedicated systems, they are often being considered independently in practical problems. While many tasks dealing with polysemy (e.g. Word Sense Disambiguation or Induction) highlight the role of word's senses, the study of synonymy is rooted in the study of concepts, i.e. meanings shared across the lexicon. In this paper, we introduce Concept Induction, the unsupervised task of learning a soft clustering among words that defines a set of concepts directly from data. This task generalizes Word Sense Induction. We propose a bi-level approach to Concept Induction that leverages both a local lemma-centric view and a global cross-lexicon view to induce concepts. We evaluate the obtained clustering on SemCor's annotated data and obtain good performance (BCubed F1 above 0.60). We find that the local and the global levels are mutually beneficial to induce concepts and also senses in our setting. Finally, we create static embeddings representing our induced concepts and use them on the Word-in-Context task, obtaining competitive performance with the State-of-the-Art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in EMNLP 2024 main conference proceedings</p></details> |
| **[EventFlow: Real-Time Neuromorphic Event-Driven Classification of Two-Phase Boiling Flow Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05467v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution, making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this, we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing event-based information. We develop five classification models using both traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed, achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal management.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, Under review in Droplet (Manuscript ID: DRO-2025-0045.R1)</p></details> |
| **[Modulation Schemes for Functionalized Vesicle-based MC Transmitters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25676v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular communication (MC) enables information exchange through the transmission of signaling molecules (SMs) and holds promise for many innovative applications. However, most existing works in MC rely on simplified transmitter (TX) models that do not account for the physical and biochemical limitations of realistic biological hardware and environments. This work extends previous efforts toward developing models for practical MC systems by proposing a more realistic TX model that incorporates the delay in SM release and TX noise introduced by biological components. Building on this more realistic, functionalized vesicle-based TX model, we propose two novel modulation schemes specifically designed for this TX to mitigate TX-induced memory effects that arise from delayed and imperfectly controllable SM release. The proposed modulation schemes enable low-complexity receiver designs by mitigating memory effects directly at the TX. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed schemes improve communication reliability under realistic biochemical constraints, offering an important step toward physically realizable MC systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures.

| **[On the Brittleness of CLIP Text Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04247v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal co-embedding models, especially CLIP, have advanced the state of the art in zero-shot classification and multimedia information retrieval in recent years by aligning images and text in a shared representation space. However, such modals trained on a contrastive alignment can lack stability towards small input perturbations. Especially when dealing with manually expressed queries, minor variations in the query can cause large differences in the ranking of the best-matching results. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the effect of multiple classes of non-semantic query perturbations in an multimedia information retrieval scenario. We evaluate a diverse set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic perturbations across multiple CLIP variants using the TRECVID Ad-Hoc Video Search queries and the V3C1 video collection. Across models, we find that syntactic and semantic perturbations drive the largest instabilities, while brittleness is concentrated in trivial surface edits such as punctuation and case. Our results highlight robustness as a critical dimension for evaluating vision-language models beyond benchmark accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MMM'26.

| **[Synapse: Adaptive Arbitration of Complementary Expertise in Time Series Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05460v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting, their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative, context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models. Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Self-adaptive weighting and sampling for physics-informed neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05452v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.</p></details> | 11 figures |
| **[How Many Tokens Do 3D Point Cloud Transformer Architectures Really Need?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05449v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

Diffusion, Flow Matching and Continuous Normalising Flows have shown effectiveness across various modalities, and rely on latent variables for generation. For experimental design or creative applications that require more control over the generation process, it has become common to manipulate the latent variable directly. However, existing approaches for performing such manipulations (e.g. interpolation or forming low-dimensional representations) only work well in special cases or are network or data-modality specific. We propose Latent Optimal Linear combinations (LOL) as a general-purpose method to form linear combinations of latent variables that adhere to the assumptions of the generative model. As LOL is easy to implement and naturally addresses the broader task of forming any linear combinations, e.g. the construction of subspaces of the latent space, LOL dramatically simplifies the creation of expressive low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

Both unsupervised and supervised classification methods are utilised using the similarity measure between two realisations derived as empirical estimates of $\mathcal N$-distances quantified based on geometric characteristics of the realisations, namely the boundary curvature and the perimeter over area ratios of obtained samples of connected components from the realisations. To justify the proposed methodology, a simulation study is performed using random set models. The methods are used further for classifying histological images of mastopathy and mammary cancer tissue.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures, supplementary material: 39 pages, 36 figures</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Ransomware Lateral Movement Susceptibility via Privilege-Weighted Adjacency Matrix Exponentiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21005v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ransomware impact hinges on how easily an intruder can move laterally and spread to the maximum number of assets. We present a graph-theoretic formulation that casts lateral movement as a path-closure problem over a probability semiring to measure lateral-movement susceptibility and estimate blast radius. We build a directed multigraph where vertices represent assets and edges represent reachable services (e.g., RDP/SSH) between them. We model lateral movement as a probabilistic process using a pivot potential factor $\pi(s)$ for each service, with step successes composed via a probabilistic path operator \( \otimes \) and alternative paths aggregated via a probabilistic union \( \oplus \) (noisy-OR). This yields a monotone fixed-point (iterative) computation of a $K$-hop compromise probability matrix that captures how compromise propagates through the network. Metrics derived from this model include: (1) Lateral-Movement Susceptibility (LMS$_K$): the average probability of a successful lateral movement between any two assets (0-1 scale); and (2) Blast-Radius Estimate (BRE$_K$): the expected percentage of assets compromised in an average attack scenario. Interactive services (SSH 22, RDP 3389) receive higher $\pi(s)$ than app-only ports (MySQL 3306, MSSQL 1433), which seldom enable pivoting without an RCE. Across anonymized enterprise snapshots, pruning high-$\pi(s)$ edges yields the largest LMS$_K$/BRE$_K$ drop, aligning with CISA guidance, MITRE ATT\&CK (TA0008: Lateral Movement), and NIST SP~800-207. The framework evaluates (micro)segmentation and helps prioritize controls that reduce lateral-movement susceptibility and shrink blast radius.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

| **[Bioinspired Soft Quadrotors Jointly Unlock Agility, Squeezability, and Collision Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05426v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways, and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off. We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3 g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8. Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience, surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress, enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77 N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility, squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without compromising flight performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables, 9 videos (not yet disclosed, awaiting peer review)</p></details> |
| **[Sharing the Learned Knowledge-base to Estimate Convolutional Filter Parameters for Continual Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05421v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However, existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead. Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time. Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks.

| **[LimiX: Unleashing Structured-Data Modeling Capability for Generalist Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03505v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX-16M and LimiX-2M, two instantiations of our large structured-data models (LDMs). Both models treat structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. They are pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX models across 11 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. LimiX-16M consistently surpasses strong baselines, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. Notably, LimiX-2M delivers strong results under tight compute and memory budgets. We also present the first scaling law study for LDMs, revealing how data and model scaling jointly influence downstream performance and offering quantitative guidance for tabular foundation modeling. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 61 pages |
| **[Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information.

| **[A semiparametric generalized exponential regression model with a principled distance-based prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03165v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalized exponential distribution is a well-known probability model in lifetime data analysis and several other research areas, including precipitation modeling. Despite having broad applications for independently and identically distributed observations, its uses as a generalized linear model for non-identically distributed data are limited. This paper introduces a semiparametric Bayesian generalized exponential (GE) regression model. Our proposed approach involves modeling the GE rate parameter within a generalized additive model framework. An important feature is the integration of a principled distance-based prior for the GE shape parameter; this allows the model to shrink to an exponential regression model that retains the advantages of the exponential family. We draw inferences using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and discuss some theoretical results pertaining to Bayesian asymptotics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms simpler alternatives. The Western Ghats mountain range holds critical importance in regulating monsoon rainfall across Southern India, profoundly impacting regional agriculture. Here, we analyze daily wet-day rainfall data for the monsoon months between 1901--2022 for the Northern, Middle, and Southern Western Ghats regions. Applying the proposed model to analyze the rainfall data over 122 years provides insights into model parameters, short-term temporal patterns, and the impact of climate change. We observe a significant decreasing trend in wet-day rainfall for the Southern Western Ghats region.</p></details> | 34 pages, 8 figures |

One major safety measure is to proactively test the LLMs with jailbreaks prior to the release. Therefore, such testing will require a method that can generate jailbreaks massively and efficiently. In this paper, we follow a novel yet intuitive strategy to generate jailbreaks in the style of the human generation. We propose a role-playing system that assigns four different roles to the user LLMs to collaborate on new jailbreaks. Furthermore, we collect existing jailbreaks and split them into different independent characteristics using clustering frequency and semantic patterns sentence by sentence. We organize these characteristics into a knowledge graph, making them more accessible and easier to retrieve. Our system of different roles will leverage this knowledge graph to generate new jailbreaks, which have proved effective in inducing LLMs to generate unethical or guideline-violating responses. In addition, we also pioneer a setting in our system that will automatically follow the government-issued guidelines to generate jailbreaks to test whether LLMs follow the guidelines accordingly. We refer to our system as GUARD (Guideline Upholding through Adaptive Role-play Diagnostics). We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on three cutting-edge open-sourced LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, and Llama-2-7B), as well as a widely-utilized commercial LLM (ChatGPT). Moreover, our work extends to the realm of vision language models (MiniGPT-v2 and Gemini Vision Pro), showcasing GUARD's versatility and contributing valuable insights for the development of safer, more reliable LLM-based applications across diverse modalities.</p></details> | 28 papges |

When the same response strategy is applied across users, minority users may assign different satisfaction ratings than majority users due to variations in individual intents and preferences. However, existing alignment methods typically train one-size-fits-all models that aim for broad consensus, often overlooking minority perspectives and user-specific adaptation. We propose a unified framework that models both individual- and group-level preferences for user satisfaction estimation. First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and group preferences. Experiments on the Emotional Support Conversation dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in user satisfaction estimation, particularly for underrepresented user groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCNL...</summary><p>IJCNLP-AACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |
| **[Advanced Hybrid Transformer LSTM Technique with Attention and TS Mixer for Drilling Rate of Penetration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05210v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rate of Penetration (ROP) prediction is critical for drilling optimization yet remains challenging due to the nonlinear, dynamic, and heterogeneous characteristics of drilling data. Conventional empirical, physics-based, and standard machine learning models rely on oversimplified assumptions or intensive feature engineering, constraining their capacity to model long-term dependencies and intricate feature interactions. To address these issues, this study presents a new deep learning Hybrid LSTM-Trans-Mixer-Att framework that first processes input data through a customized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies aligned with drilling cycles. Subsequently, an Enhanced Transformer encoder with drilling-specific positional encodings and real-time optimization refines the features. Concurrently, a parallel Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) block introduced facilitates efficient cross-feature interaction modeling of static and categorical parameters, including lithological indices and mud properties. The feature representations extracted from the Enhanced Transformer and TS-Mixer modules are integrated through a dedicated fusion layer. Finally, an adaptive attention mechanism then dynamically assigns contextual weights to salient features, enhancing discriminative representation learning and enabling high-fidelity ROP prediction. The proposed framework combines sequential memory, static feature interactions, global context learning, and dynamic feature weighting, providing a comprehensive solution for the heterogeneous and event-driven nature of drilling dynamics. Experimental validation on real-world drilling datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving an Rsquare of 0.9991 and a MAPE of 1.447%, significantly outperforming existing baseline and hybrid models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 16 Figures, 9 Tables</p></details> |

While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets.

However, these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

| **[Bioinspired Soft Quadrotors Jointly Unlock Agility, Squeezability, and Collision Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05426v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways, and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off. We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3 g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8. Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience, surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress, enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77 N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility, squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without compromising flight performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables, 9 videos (not yet disclosed, awaiting peer review)</p></details> |
| **[Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference latency and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by 12.0 points on AIME 24, 8.6 on GPQA, and 9.7 on LiveCodeBench on average for an equivalent number of memory reads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Loop Closure Detection with Foundation Models in Severely Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05404v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability, demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and pose estimation.

| **[TeaRAG: A Token-Efficient Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05385v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes external knowledge to augment Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability. For flexibility, agentic RAG employs autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed. Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/TeaRAG.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Attention and Compression is all you need for Controllably Efficient Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05313v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress & Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once, unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring 2-9x lower total memory usage.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Rethinking Metrics and Diffusion Architecture for 3D Point Cloud Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05308v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions, particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new state-of-the-art.

| **[Entropy-Rank Ratio: A Novel Entropy-Based Perspective for DNA Complexity and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05300v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shannon entropy is widely used to measure the complexity of DNA sequences but suffers from saturation effects that limit its discriminative power for long uniform segments. We introduce a novel metric, the entropy rank ratio R, which positions a target sequence within the full distribution of all possible sequences of the same length by computing the proportion of sequences that have an entropy value equal to or lower than that of the target. In other words, R expresses the relative position of a sequence within the global entropy spectrum, assigning values close to 0 for highly ordered sequences and close to 1 for highly disordered ones. DNA sequences are partitioned into fixed-length subsequences and non-overlapping n-mer groups; frequency vectors become ordered integer partitions and a combinatorial framework is used to derive the complete entropy distribution. Unlike classical measures, R is a normalized, distribution-aware measure bounded in [0,1] at fixed (T,n), which avoids saturation to log2 4 and makes values comparable across sequences under the same settings. We integrate R into data augmentation for convolutional neural networks by proposing ratio-guided cropping techniques and benchmark them against random, entropy-based, and compression-based methods. On two independent datasets, viral genes and human genes with polynucleotide expansions, models augmented via R achieve substantial gains in classification accuracy using extremely lightweight architectures.</p></details> | 31 pages, 10 figures |

To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

However, standard Federated Learning (FL), a natural fit for this distributed task, struggles with performance degradation in accuracy and communication efficiency under the non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data conditions inherent to these new environments. This paper proposes EPFL-REMNet, an efficient personalized federated framework for constructing a high-fidelity digital twin of the 6G heterogeneous radio environment. The proposed EPFL-REMNet employs a"shared backbone + lightweight personalized head" model, where only the compressed shared backbone is transmitted between the server and clients, while each client's personalized head is maintained locally. We tested EPFL-REMNet by constructing three distinct Non-IID scenarios (light, medium, and heavy) based on radio environment complexity, with data geographically partitioned across 90 clients. Experimental results demonstrate that EPFL-REMNet simultaneously achieves higher digital twin fidelity (accuracy) and lower uplink overhead across all Non-IID settings compared to standard FedAvg and recent state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, it significantly reduces performance disparities across datasets and improves local map accuracy for long-tail clients, enhancing the overall integrity of digital twin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appro...</summary><p>Approx. 12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; focuses on 6G heterogeneous radio environment digital twin construction via personalized federated learning</p></details> |

While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to previous dynamic scene representations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs, and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms, namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology, to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus, guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service (QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic, such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection, securing and enhancing. The proposed study offers an innovative, extensible way to improve cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and the administration of next-generation programmable networks.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |

This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 4 figures.

Guaranteed recovery conditions are provided for affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier modulation (SCM), highlighting the superiority of AFDM in terms of doubly sparse channel estimation. To address arbitrary Doppler shifts, a relaxed version of the on-grid model is introduced by making use of multiple elementary Expansion Models (BEM) each based on Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS). Next, theoretical guarantees are provided for the precision of this off-grid model before further extending it to tackle channel prediction by exploiting the inherent DPSS extrapolation capability. Finally, numerical results are provided to both validate the proposed off-grid model for channel estimation and prediction purposes under the double sparsity assumption and to compare the corresponding mean squared error (MSE) and the overhead performance when the different wireless waveforms are used.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version after reviewers comments for IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

In this paper, we address this gap by introducing ManufactuBERT, a RoBERTa model continually pretrained on a large-scale corpus curated for the manufacturing domain. We present a comprehensive data processing pipeline to create this corpus from web data, involving an initial domain-specific filtering step followed by a multi-stage deduplication process that removes redundancies. Our experiments show that ManufactuBERT establishes a new state-of-the-art on a range of manufacturing-related NLP tasks, outperforming strong specialized baselines. More importantly, we demonstrate that training on our carefully deduplicated corpus significantly accelerates convergence, leading to a 33\% reduction in training time and computational cost compared to training on the non-deduplicated dataset. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible example for developing high-performing encoders in other specialized domains. We will release our model and curated corpus at https://huggingface.co/cea-list-ia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to LREC 2026</p></details> |

This approach leads to estimators that are highly robust against outliers and highly efficient for normal data. These properties not only hold for estimators of the regression parameter, but also for estimators of scale invariant transformations of the variance parameters. Of main interest are MM-estimators for linear mixed effects models, but our approach also includes MM-estimators in several other standard multivariate models. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of MM-functionals and MM-estimators, establish asymptotic properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality, and derive their robustness properties in terms of breakdown point and influence function. All the results are obtained for general identifiable covariance structures and are established under mild conditions on the distribution of the observations, which goes far beyond models with elliptically contoured densities.</p></details> | 62 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Grounded in Reality: Learning and Deploying Proactive LLM from Offline Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25441v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Auto-Compressing Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09714v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. We introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. By analyzing the distinct dynamics induced by this modification, we reveal a unique property we coin as auto-compression, the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations suitable for noisy real-world tasks and continual learning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 21 pages</p></details> |

We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables, 2 supplementary figures, 4 supplementary tables, submitted to Journal of Biomedical Informatics on 6 Nov, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Challenges in 3D Data Synthesis for Training Neural Networks on Topological Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04972v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and techniques for TDA.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[USF-MAE: Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22990v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities, offering real-time, radiation-free assessment across diverse clinical domains. However, interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high noise levels, operator dependence, and limited field of view, resulting in substantial inter-observer variability. Current Deep Learning approaches are hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between general and sonographic images, which limits the transferability of models pretrained on non-medical data. To address these challenges, we introduce the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46, spanning over twenty anatomical regions. This curated dataset has been made publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility. Using a Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, USF-MAE reconstructs masked image patches, enabling it to learn rich, modality-specific representations directly from unlabeled data. The pretrained encoder was fine-tuned on three public downstream classification benchmarks: BUS-BRA (breast cancer), MMOTU-2D (ovarian tumors), and GIST514-DB (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Across all tasks, USF-MAE consistently outperformed conventional CNN and ViT baselines, achieving F1-scores of 81.6%, 79.6%, and 82.4%, respectively. Despite not using labels during pretraining, USF-MAE approached the performance of the supervised foundation model UltraSam on breast cancer classification and surpassed it on the other tasks, demonstrating strong cross-anatomical generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing public CRC datasets often lack morphologic diversity, suffer from class imbalance, and contain low-quality image tiles, limiting model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford coloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue classification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image tiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000 tiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++, designed to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an encoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors from tiles within each whole-slide image. Then, K-means clustering groups morphologically similar tiles, followed by equal-frequency binning to sample diverse morphologic patterns within each class. The selected tiles are subsequently verified by expert gastrointestinal pathologists to ensure accuracy. This semi-automated process significantly reduces manual effort while producing high-quality, diverse tiles. To evaluate STARC-9, we benchmarked convolutional neural networks, transformers, and pathology-specific foundation models on multi-class CRC tissue classification and segmentation tasks, showing superior generalizability compared to models trained on existing datasets. Although we demonstrate the utility of DeepCluster++ on CRC as a pilot use-case, it is a flexible framework that can be used for constructing high-quality datasets from large WSI repositories across a wide range of cancer and non-cancer applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 18 figures, Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Generalizable, real-time neural decoding with hybrid state-space models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05320v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time decoding of neural activity is central to neuroscience and neurotechnology applications, from closed-loop experiments to brain-computer interfaces, where models are subject to strict latency constraints. Traditional methods, including simple recurrent neural networks, are fast and lightweight but often struggle to generalize to unseen data. In contrast, recent Transformer-based approaches leverage large-scale pretraining for strong generalization performance, but typically have much larger computational requirements and are not always suitable for low-resource or real-time settings. To address these shortcomings, we present POSSM, a novel hybrid architecture that combines individual spike tokenization via a cross-attention module with a recurrent state-space model (SSM) backbone to enable (1) fast and causal online prediction on neural activity and (2) efficient generalization to new sessions, individuals, and tasks through multi-dataset pretraining. We evaluate POSSM's decoding performance and inference speed on intracortical decoding of monkey motor tasks, and show that it extends to clinical applications, namely handwriting and speech decoding in human subjects. Notably, we demonstrate that pretraining on monkey motor-cortical recordings improves decoding performance on the human handwriting task, highlighting the exciting potential for cross-species transfer. In all of these tasks, we find that POSSM achieves decoding accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art Transformers, at a fraction of the inference cost (up to 9x faster on GPU). These results suggest that hybrid SSMs are a promising approach to bridging the gap between accuracy, inference speed, and generalization when training neural decoders for real-time, closed-loop applications.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We ask whether meta-learning can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining, producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications. Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and (iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller, shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and WandB logs are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (oral) to Student Research Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution, making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this, we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing event-based information. We develop five classification models using both traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed, achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal management.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, Under review in Droplet (Manuscript ID: DRO-2025-0045.R1)</p></details> |

However, these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures.

This field has witnessed numerous advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However, existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead. Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time. Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks.

This report presents LimiX-16M and LimiX-2M, two instantiations of our large structured-data models (LDMs). Both models treat structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. They are pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX models across 11 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. LimiX-16M consistently surpasses strong baselines, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. Notably, LimiX-2M delivers strong results under tight compute and memory budgets. We also present the first scaling law study for LDMs, revealing how data and model scaling jointly influence downstream performance and offering quantitative guidance for tabular foundation modeling. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 61 pages |

However, in Transformer LLMs, generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference. The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference latency and memory load. For instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by 12.0 points on AIME 24, 8.6 on GPQA, and 9.7 on LiveCodeBench on average for an equivalent number of memory reads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A semiparametric generalized exponential regression model with a principled distance-based prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03165v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalized exponential distribution is a well-known probability model in lifetime data analysis and several other research areas, including precipitation modeling. Despite having broad applications for independently and identically distributed observations, its uses as a generalized linear model for non-identically distributed data are limited. This paper introduces a semiparametric Bayesian generalized exponential (GE) regression model. Our proposed approach involves modeling the GE rate parameter within a generalized additive model framework. An important feature is the integration of a principled distance-based prior for the GE shape parameter; this allows the model to shrink to an exponential regression model that retains the advantages of the exponential family. We draw inferences using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and discuss some theoretical results pertaining to Bayesian asymptotics. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms simpler alternatives. The Western Ghats mountain range holds critical importance in regulating monsoon rainfall across Southern India, profoundly impacting regional agriculture. Here, we analyze daily wet-day rainfall data for the monsoon months between 1901--2022 for the Northern, Middle, and Southern Western Ghats regions. Applying the proposed model to analyze the rainfall data over 122 years provides insights into model parameters, short-term temporal patterns, and the impact of climate change. We observe a significant decreasing trend in wet-day rainfall for the Southern Western Ghats region.</p></details> | 34 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Block-structured Operator Inference for coupled multiphysics model reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05389v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a block-structured formulation of Operator Inference as a way to learn structured reduced-order models for multiphysics systems. The approach specifies the governing equation structure for each physics component and the structure of the coupling terms. Once the multiphysics structure is specified, the reduced-order model is learned from snapshot data following the nonintrusive Operator Inference methodology. In addition to preserving physical system structure, which in turn permits preservation of system properties such as stability and second-order structure, the block-structured approach has the advantages of reducing the overall dimensionality of the learning problem and admitting tailored regularization for each physics component. The numerical advantages of the block-structured formulation over a monolithic Operator Inference formulation are demonstrated for aeroelastic analysis, which couples aerodynamic and structural models. For the benchmark test case of the AGARD 445.6 wing, block-structured Operator Inference provides an average 20% online prediction speedup over monolithic Operator Inference across subsonic and supersonic flow conditions in both the stable and fluttering parameter regimes while preserving the accuracy achieved with monolithic Operator Inference.</p></details> | 28 pages, 19 figures |
| **[Star-Based Separators for Intersection Graphs of $c$-Colored Pseudo-Segments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05371v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Planar Separator Theorem, which states that any planar graph $\mathcal{G}$ has a separator consisting of $O(\sqrt{n})$ nodes whose removal partitions $\mathcal{G}$ into components of size at most $\tfrac{2n}{3}$, is a widely used tool to obtain fast algorithms on planar graphs. Intersection graphs of disks, which generalize planar graphs, do not admit such separators. It has recently been shown that disk graphs do admit so-called clique-based separators that consist of $O(\sqrt{n})$ cliques. This result has been generalized to intersection graphs of various other types of disk-like objects. Unfortunately, segment intersection graphs do not admit small clique-based separators, because they can contain arbitrarily large bicliques. This is true even in the simple case of axis-aligned segments. In this paper we therefore introduce biclique-based separators (and, in particular, star-based separators), which are separators consisting of a small number of bicliques (or stars). We prove that any $c$-oriented set of $n$ segments in the plane, where $c$ is a constant, admits a star-based separator consisting of $O(\sqrt{n})$ stars. In fact, our result is more general, as it applies to any set of $n$ pseudo-segments that is partitioned into $c$ subsets such that the pseudo-segments in the same subset are pairwise disjoint. We extend our result to intersection graphs of $c$-oriented polygons. These results immediately lead to an almost-exact distance oracle for such intersection graphs, which has $O(n\sqrt{n})$ storage and $O(\sqrt{n})$ query time, and that can report the hop-distance between any two query nodes in the intersection graph with an additive error of at most 2. This is the first distance oracle for such types of intersection graphs that has subquadratic storage and sublinear query time and that only has an additive error.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

Under a Poisson framework, we consider two related goals: (i) parametric inference, the estimation of the full distributional parameter tensor, and (ii) multiway analysis, the recovery of its canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition factors. Our main result shows that in the rank-one setting, a rank-constrained maximum-likelihood estimator achieves multiway analysis with variance matching the Cram\'{e}r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) up to absolute constants and logarithmic factors. This provides a general framework for studying "near-efficient" multiway estimators in finite-sample settings. For higher ranks, we illustrate that our multiway estimator may not attain the CRLB; nevertheless, CP-based parametric inference remains nearly minimax optimal, with error bounds that improve on prior work by offering more favorable dependence on the CP rank. Numerical experiments corroborate near-efficiency in the rank-one case and highlight the efficiency gap in higher-rank scenarios.</p></details> | 28 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Latent-Variable Formulation of the Poisson Canonical Polyadic Tensor Model: Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Fisher Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05352v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish parameter inference for the Poisson canonical polyadic (PCP) tensor model through a latent-variable formulation. Our approach exploits the observation that any random PCP tensor can be derived by marginalizing an unobservable random tensor of one dimension larger. The loglikelihood of this larger dimensional tensor, referred to as the "complete" loglikelihood, is comprised of multiple rank one PCP loglikelihoods. Using this methodology, we first derive non-iterative maximum likelihood estimators for the PCP model and demonstrate that several existing algorithms for fitting non-negative matrix and tensor factorizations are Expectation-Maximization algorithms. Next, we derive the observed and expected Fisher information matrices for the PCP model. The Fisher information provides us crucial insights into the well-posedness of the tensor model, such as the role that tensor rank plays in identifiability and indeterminacy. For the special case of rank one PCP models, we demonstrate that these results are greatly simplified.</p></details> | 24 pages, 2 figures |

We represent these models with colored DAGs and investigate their properties for use in statistical and causal inference. Local and global Markov properties are provided and shown to characterize the colored DAG model. Additional properties relevant to causal discovery are studied, including the existence and non-existence of faithful distributions and structural identifiability. Extending prior work of Peters and B\"uhlmann and Wu and Drton, we prove structural identifiability under the assumption of homogeneous structural coefficients, as well as for a family of models with partially homogeneous structural coefficients. The latter models, termed BPEC-DAGs, capture additional causal insights by clustering the direct causes of each node into communities according to their effect on their common target. An analogue of the GES algorithm for learning BPEC-DAGs is given and evaluated on real and synthetic data. Regarding model geometry, we provide a proof of a conjecture of Sullivant which generalizes to colored DAG models, colored undirected graphical models and directed ancestral graph models. The proof yields a tool for identification of Markov properties for any rationally parameterized model with globally, rationally identifiable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages; v3: another major revision</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

Inferring Chinese Cuisine Intake from Wearable IMUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05292v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias, while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore, existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at https://github.com/joeeeeyin/CuisineSense.git.</p></details> | 5 pages |

In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a proceedings paper at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2025, December 1-2, 2025, San Diego, United States, 15 pages</p></details> |

However, we reveal that this approach can lead to weak vision-language alignment, making these models overly dependent on costly instruction-following data. To address this, we introduce ExGra-Med, a novel multi-graph alignment framework that jointly aligns images, instruction responses, and extended captions in the latent space, advancing semantic grounding and cross-modal coherence. To scale to large LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-7B), we develop an efficient end-to-end training scheme using black-box gradient estimation, enabling fast and scalable optimization. Empirically, ExGra-Med matches LLaVA-Med's performance using just 10% of the pre-training data, achieving a 20.13% gain on VQA-RAD and approaching full-data performance. It also outperforms strong baselines like BioMedGPT and RadFM on visual chatbot and zero-shot classification tasks, demonstrating its promise for efficient, high-quality vision-language integration in medical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated. Specifically, they tend to overestimate the success probability that a partial reasoning step will lead to a correct final answer, particularly when smaller LLMs are used to complete the reasoning trajectory. To address this, we present a calibration approach -- performed via quantile regression -- that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the compute budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective IAS, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Statistical Inference for Extended Target Detection in mmWave Automotive Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26573v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar systems offer high range resolution due to their wide bandwidth, enabling the detection of multiple spatially distributed scatterers from a single extended target, such as a vehicle. Traditional CFAR-based detection methods often treat these scatterers as independent point targets, thereby neglecting the inherent spatial structure of extended objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Range-Doppler (RD) segment-based statistical inference framework that captures the characteristic scattering profile of extended automotive targets. The framework employs Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for statistical parameter extraction and utilizes Gibbs sampling within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme to model the posterior distribution of the segment features. A skewness-based test statistic, derived from the estimated distribution, is introduced for binary hypothesis testing to distinguish extended targets. Furthermore, we develop a detection pipeline incorporating Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics and peak-centric segment alignment, optimized for single-dwell radar operations. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving enhanced detection accuracy and robustness in automotive radar scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

We prove a variational principle for the limiting pseudo-maximum likelihood which also characterizes the performance of the corresponding pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator. We show that this variational principle is universal and depends only on four parameters determined by the corresponding null model. Through this universality, we introduce a notion of equivalence for estimation problems of this type and, in particular, show that a broad class of estimation tasks, including community detection, sparse submatrix detection, and non-linear spiked matrix models, are equivalent to spiked matrix models. As an application, we obtain a complete description of the performance of the least-squares (or ``best rank one'') estimator for any rank one matrix estimation problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 3 figures; added more examples and figures, modified the orgainization of the article</p></details> |

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.</p></details> | 9 pages |

For decades, operationalizing this step for complex, non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework, a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity, individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 10 figures.

Learned Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization. However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties. Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages.

Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization. Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control, enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5 percent additional cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NIPS 2025</p></details> |

Our results show that DeepONets, and especially PI-DeepONets, achieve accurate predictions under diverse scenarios, providing over 30 times speedup compared to high-order ODE solvers. Benchmarking against Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) highlights superior stability and scalability.

A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion, then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models, which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the parameter-efficient adaptation of binary-quantized generative models for image editing, and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose EditInfinity, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our EditInfinity to perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark across `add', `change', and `delete' editing operations, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

| **[Rethinking Approximate Gaussian Inference in Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03366v3)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classification tasks, softmax functions are ubiquitously used as output activations to produce predictive probabilities. Such outputs only capture aleatoric uncertainty. To capture epistemic uncertainty, approximate Gaussian inference methods have been proposed. We develop a common formalism to describe such methods, which we view as outputting Gaussian distributions over the logit space. Predictives are then obtained as the expectations of the Gaussian distributions pushed forward through the softmax. However, such softmax Gaussian integrals cannot be solved analytically, and Monte Carlo (MC) approximations can be costly and noisy. We propose to replace the softmax activation by element-wise normCDF or sigmoid, which allows for the accurate sampling-free approximation of predictives. This also enables the approximation of the Gaussian pushforwards by Dirichlet distributions with moment matching. This approach entirely eliminates the runtime and memory overhead associated with MC sampling. We evaluate it combined with several approximate Gaussian inference methods (Laplace, HET, SNGP) on large- and small-scale datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10), demonstrating improved uncertainty quantification capabilities compared to softmax MC sampling.

Different meta-learning approaches all work under/with the mini-batch episodic training framework. Such framework naturally gives the information about task identity, which can serve as additional supervision for meta-training to improve generalizability. We propose to exploit task identity as additional supervision in meta-training, inspired by the alignment and discrimination ability which is is intrinsic in human's fast learning. This is achieved by contrasting what meta-learners learn, i.e., model representations. The proposed ConML is evaluating and optimizing the contrastive meta-objective under a problem- and learner-agnostic meta-training framework. We demonstrate that ConML integrates seamlessly with existing meta-learners, as well as in-context learning models, and brings significant boost in performance with small implementation cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Recei...</summary><p>Received by NeurIPS2025 (Oral)</p></details> |

One interesting example is the Mondrian random forest, in which the underlying constituent trees are constructed via a Mondrian process. We give precise bias and variance characterizations, along with a Berry-Esseen-type central limit theorem, for the Mondrian random forest regression estimator. By combining these results with a carefully crafted debiasing approach and an accurate variance estimator, we present valid statistical inference methods for the unknown regression function. These methods come with explicitly characterized error bounds in terms of the sample size, tree complexity parameter, and number of trees in the forest, and include coverage error rates for feasible confidence interval estimators. Our debiasing procedure for the Mondrian random forest also allows it to achieve the minimax-optimal point estimation convergence rate in mean squared error for multivariate $\beta$-H\"older regression functions, for all $\beta > 0$, provided that the underlying tuning parameters are chosen appropriately. Efficient and implementable algorithms are devised for both batch and online learning settings, and we study the computational complexity of different Mondrian random forest implementations. Finally, simulations with synthetic data validate our theory and methodology, demonstrating their excellent finite-sample properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables</p></details> |

Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce Prediction-Powered Adaptive Shrinkage (PAS), a method that bridges PPI with empirical Bayes shrinkage to improve the estimation of multiple means. PAS debiases noisy ML predictions within each task and then borrows strength across tasks by using those same predictions as a reference point for shrinkage. The amount of shrinkage is determined by minimizing an unbiased estimate of risk, and we prove that this tuning strategy is asymptotically optimal. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PAS adapts to the reliability of the ML predictions and outperforms traditional and modern baselines in large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as poster in ICML 2025</p></details> |

Traditional causal inference often focuses on unidirectional effects, overlooking the common bidirectional relationships in real-world phenomena. Building on heteroskedasticity-based identification, the proposed method integrates a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for simultaneous equation models with large scale online kernel learning. It employs random Fourier feature approximations to flexibly model nonlinear conditional means and variances, while an adaptive online gradient descent algorithm ensures computational efficiency for streaming and high-dimensional data. Results from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy and stability than single equation and polynomial approximation baselines, exhibiting lower bias and root mean squared error across various data-generating processes. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively captures complex bidirectional causal effects with near-linear computational scaling. By combining econometric identification with modern machine learning techniques, the proposed framework offers a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for large scale causal inference in natural/social science, policy making, business, and industrial applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proceedings of the 2025 International Conference on Data Science and Intelligent Systems (DSIS 2025)</p></details> |

We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles.

Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04412v5)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.

| **[Consistency Trajectory Matching for One-Step Generative Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20349v5)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) approaches achieve commendable performance at the cost of high inference overhead. Therefore, distillation techniques are utilized to accelerate the multi-step teacher model into one-step student model. Nevertheless, these methods significantly raise training costs and constrain the performance of the student model by the teacher model. To overcome these tough challenges, we propose Consistency Trajectory Matching for Super-Resolution (CTMSR), a distillation-free strategy that is able to generate photo-realistic SR results in one step. Concretely, we first formulate a Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory to establish a deterministic mapping from low-resolution (LR) images with noise to high-resolution (HR) images. Then we apply the Consistency Training (CT) strategy to directly learn the mapping in one step, eliminating the necessity of pre-trained diffusion model. To further enhance the performance and better leverage the ground-truth during the training process, we aim to align the distribution of SR results more closely with that of the natural images. To this end, we propose to minimize the discrepancy between their respective PF-ODE trajectories from the LR image distribution by our meticulously designed Distribution Trajectory Matching (DTM) loss, resulting in improved realism of our recovered HR images. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods can attain comparable or even superior capabilities on both synthetic and real datasets while maintaining minimal inference latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[LoRA-Edge: Tensor-Train-Assisted LoRA for Practical CNN Fine-Tuning on Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03765v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-device fine-tuning of CNNs is essential to withstand domain shift in edge applications such as Human Activity Recognition (HAR), yet full fine-tuning is infeasible under strict memory, compute, and energy budgets. We present LoRA-Edge, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that builds on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with tensor-train assistance. LoRA-Edge (i) applies Tensor-Train Singular Value Decomposition (TT-SVD) to pre-trained convolutional layers, (ii) selectively updates only the output-side core with zero-initialization to keep the auxiliary path inactive at the start, and (iii) fuses the update back into dense kernels, leaving inference cost unchanged. This design preserves convolutional structure and reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to two orders of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning. Across diverse HAR datasets and CNN backbones, LoRA-Edge achieves accuracy within 4.7% of full fine-tuning while updating at most 1.49% of parameters, consistently outperforming prior parameter-efficient baselines under similar budgets. On a Jetson Orin Nano, TT-SVD initialization and selective-core training yield 1.4-3.8x faster convergence to target F1. LoRA-Edge thus makes structure-aligned, parameter-efficient on-device CNN adaptation practical for edge platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, DATE 2026 accepted paper</p></details> |
| **[Challenges in 3D Data Synthesis for Training Neural Networks on Topological Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04972v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and techniques for TDA.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Fine-Tuning Masked Diffusion for Provable Self-Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01384v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality, limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM. Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales: Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authorship statement: Jaeyeon Kim and Seunggeun Kim contributed equally, and Taekyun Lee is also a co first author</p></details> |

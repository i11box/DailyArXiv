| **[OmniVinci: Enhancing Architecture and Data for Omni-Modal Understanding LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15870v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[LightsOut: Diffusion-based Outpainting for Enhanced Lens Flare Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15868v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

| **[BiomedXPro: Prompt Optimization for Explainable Diagnosis with Biomedical Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15866v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features, grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages + 15 Supplementary Material Pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[PolySkill: Learning Generalizable Skills Through Polymorphic Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15863v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed). Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum, leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web continuously.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[InfiMed-ORBIT: Aligning LLMs on Open-Ended Complex Tasks via Rubric-Based Incremental Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15859v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[SpeechLLMs for Large-scale Contextualized Zero-shot Slot Filling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15851v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slot filling is a crucial subtask in spoken language understanding (SLU), traditionally implemented as a cascade of speech recognition followed by one or more natural language understanding (NLU) components. The recent advent of speech-based large language models (speechLLMs), which integrate speech and textual foundation models, has opened new avenues for achieving speech understanding tasks in a more unified, generative, and instruction-following manner while promising data and compute efficiency with zero-shot abilities, generalizing to unseen slot labels. We address the slot-filling task by creating an empirical upper bound for the task, identifying performance, robustness, and generalization gaps, and proposing improvements to the training data, architecture, and training strategies to narrow the gap with the upper bound result. We show that each of these measures improve performance substantially, while highlighting practical challenges and providing empirical guidance and insights for harnessing these emerging models.</p></details> | 13 pages, EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Kernel-based Koopman approximants for control: Flexible sampling, error analysis, and stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02811v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven techniques for analysis, modeling, and control of complex dynamical systems are on the uptake. Koopman theory provides the theoretical foundation for the popular kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kEDMD). In this work, we propose a novel kEDMD scheme to approximate nonlinear control systems accompanied by an in-depth error analysis. Key features are regularization-based robustness and an adroit decomposition into micro and macro grids enabling flexible sampling. But foremost, we prove proportionality, i.e., explicit dependence on the distance to the (controlled) equilibrium, of the derived bound on the full approximation error. Leveraging this key property, we rigorously show that asymptotic stability of the data-driven surrogate (control) system implies asymptotic stability of the original (control) system and vice versa.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |
| **[3DPR: Single Image 3D Portrait Relight using Generative Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15846v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry, material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods, particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

| **[Paper2Web: Let's Make Your Paper Alive!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15842v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction. However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM) generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity, Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity, aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

| **[Transfer Orthology Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15837v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space. The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)</p></details> |
| **[Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group With Vision-Language Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05342v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

| **[FinChain: A Symbolic Benchmark for Verifiable Chain-of-Thought Financial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02515v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step symbolic reasoning is essential for robust financial analysis; yet, current benchmarks largely overlook this capability. Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, includes figures and tables; introduces the FinChain benchmark and ChainEval metric</p></details> |
| **[GENESIS: A Generative Model of Episodic-Semantic Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15828v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to explain how semantic and episodic memory, two major forms of declarative memory, typically associated with cortical and hippocampal processing, interact to support learning, recall, and imagination. Despite significant advances, we still lack a unified computational framework that jointly accounts for core empirical phenomena across both semantic and episodic processing domains. Here, we introduce the Generative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational model that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity generative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and generalization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and retrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS reproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic memory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in episodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their dynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the fidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces systematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can recombine previous experiences. Together, these results provide a principled account of memory as an active, constructive, and resource-bounded process. GENESIS thus advances a unified theoretical framework that bridges semantic and episodic memory, offering new insights into the generative foundations of human cognition.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Blackwell's Approachability for Sequential Conformal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15824v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study conformal inference in non-exchangeable environments through the lens of Blackwell's theory of approachability. We first recast adaptive conformal inference (ACI, Gibbs and Cand\`es, 2021) as a repeated two-player vector-valued finite game and characterize attainable coverage--efficiency tradeoffs. We then construct coverage and efficiency objectives under potential restrictions on the adversary's play, and design a calibration-based approachability strategy to achieve these goals. The resulting algorithm enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and provides practical insights, though its computational burden may limit deployment in practice.</p></details> | 25 pages, 0 figures |
| **[What's Wrong with Your Code Generated by Large Language Models? An Extensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06153v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing development of LLMs in code generation has drawn significant attention among researchers. To enhance LLM-based code generation ability, current efforts are predominantly directed towards collecting high-quality datasets and leveraging diverse training technologies. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies examining the limitations and boundaries of existing methods. To bridge this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study evaluating the performance of three leading closed-source LLMs and six popular open-source LLMs on three commonly used benchmarks. Our investigation, which evaluated the length, cyclomatic complexity and API number of the generated code, revealed that these LLMs face challenges in generating successful code for more complex problems, and tend to produce code that is shorter yet more complicated as compared to canonical solutions. Additionally, we developed a taxonomy of bugs for incorrect codes that includes three categories and ten sub-categories, and analyzed the root cause for common bug types. To better understand the performance of LLMs in real-world projects, we also manually created a real-world benchmark RWPB. We analyzed bugs on RWPB to highlight distinct differences in bug distributions between actual scenarios and existing benchmarks. Finally, we propose a novel training-free iterative method that introduces self-critique, enabling LLMs to critique and correct their generated code based on bug types and compiler feedback. Our comprehensive and extensive study provides insights into the current limitations of LLM-based code generation and opportunities for enhancing the accuracy and quality of the generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences (SCIS)</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Interpret Weight Differences in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05092v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project code and links to weight diffs, adapters, and training data can be found at https://github.com/Aviously/diff-interpretation-tuning</p></details> |

Although termed differently, these methods share common concepts and methods, suggesting unification under what-if analysis. Yet a unified framework to define motivations, core components, and its distinct types is lacking. To address this gap, we reviewed 141 publications from leading visual analytics and HCI venues (2014-2024). Our analysis (1) outlines the motivations for what-if analysis, (2) introduces Praxa, a structured framework that identifies its fundamental components and characterizes its distinct types, and (3) highlights challenges associated with the application and implementation. Together, our findings establish a standardized vocabulary and structural understanding, enabling more consistent use across domains and communicate with greater conceptual clarity. Finally, we identify open research problems and future directions to advance what-if analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>What-...</summary><p>What-if analysis for business intelligence</p></details> |
| **[On Universality of Deep Equivariant Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15814v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universality results for equivariant neural networks remain rare. Those that do exist typically hold only in restrictive settings: either they rely on regular or higher-order tensor representations, leading to impractically high-dimensional hidden spaces, or they target specialized architectures, often confined to the invariant setting. This work develops a more general account. For invariant networks, we establish a universality theorem under separation constraints, showing that the addition of a fully connected readout layer secures approximation within the class of separation-constrained continuous functions. For equivariant networks, where results are even scarcer, we demonstrate that standard separability notions are inadequate and introduce the sharper criterion of $\textit{entry-wise separability}$. We show that with sufficient depth or with the addition of appropriate readout layers, equivariant networks attain universality within the entry-wise separable regime. Together with prior results showing the failure of universality for shallow models, our findings identify depth and readout layers as a decisive mechanism for universality, additionally offering a unified perspective that subsumes and extends earlier specialized results.</p></details> | Preprint. 22 pages |

This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the engagement effectiveness of cognitive attacks by introducing a weighted interaction metric that accounts for both the type and volume of user engagement relative to the number of attacker-generated transmissions. Applying this model to real-world disinformation campaigns across social media platforms, we demonstrate how the metric captures not just reach but the behavioral depth of user engagement. Our findings provide new insights into the behavioral dynamics of cognitive warfare and offer actionable tools for researchers and practitioners seeking to assess and counter the spread of malicious influence online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unive...</summary><p>University of Colorado Colorado Springs and Department of the Air Force, US Air Force Academy.

| **[Emergence of Linear Truth Encodings in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15804v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models. Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear truth representations can emerge in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[ERNet: Efficient Non-Rigid Registration Network for Point Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15800v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges, we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach (i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[Ambusher: Exploring the Security of Distributed SDN Controllers Through Protocol State Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15798v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed SDN (Software-Defined Networking) controllers have rapidly become an integral element of Wide Area Networks (WAN), particularly within SD-WAN, providing scalability and fault-tolerance for expansive network infrastructures. However, the architecture of these controllers introduces new potential attack surfaces that have thus far received inadequate attention. In response to these concerns, we introduce Ambusher, a testing tool designed to discover vulnerabilities within protocols used in distributed SDN controllers. Ambusher achieves this by leveraging protocol state fuzzing, which systematically finds attack scenarios based on an inferred state machine. Since learning states from a cluster is complicated, Ambusher proposes a novel methodology that extracts a single and relatively simple state machine, achieving efficient state-based fuzzing. Our evaluation of Ambusher, conducted on a real SD-WAN deployment spanning two campus networks and one enterprise network, illustrates its ability to uncover 6 potential vulnerabilities in the widely used distributed controller platform.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

Approximate methods such as variational inference (VI), inducing points (sparse GPs), low-rank factorizations (RFFs), local factorizations and approximations (INLA), improve scalability but trade off accuracy or flexibility. We introduce DeepRV, a neural-network surrogate that closely matches full GP accuracy including hyperparameter estimates, while reducing computational complexity to $O(N^2)$, increasing scalability and inference speed. DeepRV serves as a drop-in replacement for GP prior realisations in e.g. MCMC-based probabilistic programming pipelines, preserving full model flexibility. Across simulated benchmarks, non-separable spatiotemporal GPs, and a real-world application to education deprivation in London (n = 4,994 locations), DeepRV achieves the highest fidelity to exact GPs while substantially accelerating inference. Code is provided in the accompanying ZIP archive, with all experiments run on a single consumer-grade GPU to ensure accessibility for practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code to reproduce all experiments is available in the ancillary file deep_rv_code, with instructions in the included README</p></details> |

We synthesize a brake controller that assists drivers and guarantees safety against excessive lateral motions (i.e., prevents the vehicle from spinning out) while minimizing the stopping distance. We address this safety-critical control problem in the presence of input constraints, since braking forces are limited by the available friction on the road. We use backup control barrier functions for safe control design. As this approach requires the construction of a backup set and a backup controller, we propose a novel, systematic method to creating valid backup set-backup controller pairs based on feedback linearization and continuous-time Lyapunov equations. We use simple examples to demonstrate our proposed safety-critical control method. Finally, we implement our approach on a four-wheel vehicle model for braking on asymmetric surfaces and present simulation results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering. 14 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

The optimal strategy for this problem is given by Wald's Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), which compares the log-likelihood ratio against fixed thresholds to determine a stopping time. Classical proofs of this result typically rely on analytical, continuous, and non-constructive arguments. In this paper, we present a discrete, self-contained proof of the optimality of the SPRT for this problem. We model the problem as a biased random walk on the two-dimensional (heads, tails) integer lattice, and model strategies as marked stopping times on this lattice. Our proof takes a straightforward greedy approach, showing how any arbitrary strategy may be transformed into the optimal, parallel-line "difference policy" corresponding to the SPRT, via a sequence of local perturbations that improve a Bayes risk objective.</p></details> | 20 pages |

However, no causal discovery methods currently incorporate explainability into their models to derive the causal graphs. Thus, in this paper we explore this innovative approach, as it offers substantial potential and represents a promising new direction worth investigating. Specifically, we introduce ReX, a causal discovery method that leverages machine learning (ML) models coupled with explainability techniques, specifically Shapley values, to identify and interpret significant causal relationships among variables. Comparative evaluations on synthetic datasets comprising continuous tabular data reveal that ReX outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods across diverse data generation processes, including non-linear and additive noise models. Moreover, ReX was tested on the Sachs single-cell protein-signaling dataset, achieving a precision of 0.952 and recovering key causal relationships with no incorrect edges. Taking together, these results showcase ReX's effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures while minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse datasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and explainability techniques with causal discovery, ReX bridges the gap between predictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for understanding complex causal structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 30 figures, Published in Elsevier's Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

Yet their rapid rise raises a key question: should researchers train specialist models from scratch, fine-tune generalist foundation models, or use hybrid approaches? The trade-offs in data efficiency, accuracy, cost, and robustness to out-of-distribution failure remain unclear. We introduce a benchmarking framework using defect migration pathways, evaluated through nudged elastic band trajectories, as diagnostic probes that test both interpolation and extrapolation. Using Cr-doped Sb2Te3 as a representative two-dimensional material, we benchmark multiple training paradigms within the MACE architecture across equilibrium, kinetic (atomic migration), and mechanical (interlayer sliding) tasks. Fine-tuned models substantially outperform from-scratch and zero-shot approaches for kinetic properties but show partial loss of long-range physics. Representational analysis reveals distinct, non-overlapping latent encodings, indicating that different training strategies learn different aspects of system physics.

But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1) are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location; 2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions. However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data, achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone architectures, and data scales.

We explore the use of graph states with flexible, non-trivial qubit-to-node assignments. This flexibility enables adaptable engineering of the entanglement topology of an arbitrary quantum network. In particular, we focus on cluster states with arbitrary allocation as network resource states and as a promising candidate for a network core-level entangled resource, due to its intrinsic flexible connectivity properties and resilience to particle losses. We introduce a modeling framework for overlaying entanglement topologies on physical networks and demonstrate how optimized and even random qubit assignment, creates shortcuts and improves robustness and memory savings, while substantially reducing the average hop distance between remote network nodes, when compared to conventional approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been funded by the European Union under the ERC grant QNattyNet, n. 101169850</p></details> |

Modern examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example, fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools, LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The `dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.</p></details> | 50 pages, 4 figures |

TRON leverages orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space. The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.</p></details> | 4 pages |

We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models. Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then -- over a longer horizon -- learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear truth representations can emerge in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Neurips 2025</p></details> |

We bridge this gap by assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small, carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis.

Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce, and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs -- struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks, reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as training data for supervised finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 16 figures, website: http://proof-optimizer.github.io/</p></details> |

While existing approaches have achieved notable results in verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1) Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to semantically grounded verification.

Two context generation strategies are examined: one focused on named entities and the other on full-text prompting. Four methods of incorporating context into the classifier input are compared: text concatenation, embedding concatenation, a hierarchical transformer-based fusion, and LLM-driven text enhancement. Experiments are conducted on the textual Latent Hatred dataset of implicit hate speech and applied in a multimodal setting on the MAMI dataset of misogynous memes. Results suggest that both the contextual information and the method by which it is incorporated are key, with gains of up to 3 and 6 F1 points on textual and multimodal setups respectively, from a zero-context baseline to the highest-performing system, based on embedding concatenation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, submitted to LREC 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD, particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, BraTS GoAT 2025 challenge</p></details> |

A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters (i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as TinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning across benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and Contriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve improved retrieval performance.

We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED), addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in microscopy workflows.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 Figures |

Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.13725</p></details> |

Robust EEG analytics have the potential to greatly improve patient care. However, traditional deep learning models, especially Transformer-based architectures, are hindered by their quadratic time and memory complexity, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we present FEMBA (Foundational EEG Mamba + Bidirectional Architecture), a novel self-supervised framework that establishes new efficiency benchmarks for EEG analysis through bidirectional state-space modeling. Unlike Transformer-based models, which incur quadratic time and memory complexity, FEMBA scales linearly with sequence length, enabling more scalable and efficient processing of extended EEG recordings. Trained on over 21,000 hours of unlabeled EEG and fine-tuned on three downstream tasks, FEMBA achieves competitive performance in comparison with transformer models, with significantly lower computational cost. Specifically, it reaches 81.82% balanced accuracy (0.8921 AUROC) on TUAB and 0.949 AUROC on TUAR, while a tiny 7.8M-parameter variant demonstrates viability for resource-constrained devices. These results pave the way for scalable, general-purpose EEG analytics in both clinical and highlight FEMBA as a promising candidate for wearable applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, Camera-ready version, EMBC 2025</p></details> |

Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints, enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values (M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures.

In the case of algebraic tensor functions, we prove that the asymptotic exponent of both the tensor-tensor multiplication and the tensor polynomial evaluation problem under this multiplication is the same as that of the matrix multiplication, unless the linear map is injective. As for non-algebraic functions, we define the tensor geometric mean and the tensor Wasserstein mean for pseudo-positive-definite tensors under the tensor-tensor multiplication with invertible linear maps, and we show that the tensor geometric mean can be calculated by solving a specific Riccati tensor equation. Furthermore, we show that the tensor geometric mean does not satisfy the resultantal (determinantal) identity in general, which the matrix geometric mean always satisfies. Then we define a pseudo-SVD for the injective linear map case and we apply it on image data compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 3 figures.

Content-based sequential recommendation has recently emerged as a promising direction that exploits items' textual and visual features to enhance preference learning. However, there are still three key challenges: (i) how to reduce the semantic gap between different content modality representations; (ii) how to jointly model user behavior preferences and content preferences; and (iii) how to design an effective training strategy to align ID representations and content representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, self-supervised representation learning with ID-Content modality alignment, named SICSRec. Firstly, we propose a LLM-driven sample construction method and develop a supervised fine-tuning approach to align item-level modality representations. Secondly, we design a novel Transformer-based sequential model, where an ID-modality sequence encoder captures user behavior preferences, a content-modality sequence encoder learns user content preferences, and a mix-modality sequence decoder grasps the intrinsic relationship between these two types of preferences. Thirdly, we propose a two-step training strategy with a content-aware contrastive learning task to align modality representations and ID representations, which decouples the training process of content modality dependency and item collaborative dependency. Extensive experiments conducted on four public video streaming datasets demonstrate our SICSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art ID-modality sequential recommenders and content-modality sequential recommenders by 8.04% on NDCG@5 and 6.62% on NDCD@10 on average, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-025-50269-4}</p></details> |

We first formulate the image recovery as a special multiple measurement vector (MMV) compressed sensing (CS) problem, where at various frequencies the sensing matrices can be different, and the image coefficients are correlated. To solve such an MMV problem with various sensing matrices and correlated coefficients, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based solution to simultaneously estimate all image coefficients and their correlation on multiple frequencies. Moreover, to enhance estimation performance, we design two illumination patterns following two different criteria. From the CS perspective, the first design minimizes the total coherence of the sensing matrix to increase the mutual orthogonality of the basis vectors. Alternatively, to improve SNR, the second design maximizes the illumination power of the imaging area. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SBL-based method and the superiority of the illumination designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

Furthermore, existing pixel-space video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework, which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and, crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our 7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence purity and the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Under review</p></details> |

Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and model are available at https://github.com/M-E-AGI-Lab/Muddit</p></details> |

However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |

Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+ clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1) Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions (liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points (good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points (good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.</p></details> | 43 pages, 27 figures |
| **[FreqPDE: Rethinking Positional Depth Embedding for Multi-View 3D Object Detection Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15385v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism. Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and 3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |
| **[Towards Robust Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15382v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods.

During inference we rank tokens by the gate values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15% compute while retaining over 90% of baseline accuracy. For increasingly larger models, this tradeoff improves drastically. On instruction-tuned models we see accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50% savings. The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization, pruning, and self-speculative decoding.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint \underline{c}ompression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high \underline{a}ccuracy, fast \underline{i}nference speed, and favorable \underline{t}ransferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI 2025 Camera-ready Version</p></details> |

While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |
| **[ACON: Optimizing Context Compression for Long-horizon LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00615v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

| **[Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Pre-trained Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01890v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism within large language models (LLMs), previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to reduce the redundancy by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LISA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LISA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LISA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53%-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LISA achieve a 6x compression of Q and K matrices within the attention mechanism, with maximum throughput improvements 19.5%, 32.3%, and 40.1% for LLaMA3-8B, LLaMA2-7B, and LLaMA2-13B, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version accepted by TACL, prior to its publication by MIT Press</p></details> |

However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

While existing BLO methods are mostly developed in Euclidean spaces, many real-world problems involve structural constraints. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian bilevel optimization (RBLO) algorithm that incorporates a bilevel descent aggregation (BDA) scheme to jointly coordinate upper- and lower-level updates. Concretely, first we abstract the constraints in the BLO to a manifold structure and then transform the constrained BLO be a unconstrained RBLO problem. Second, to address limitations of existing RBLO methods, particularly the restrictive assumptions required for convergence, we reformulate the bilevel problem using smooth manifold mappings and provide a convergence analysis under the conditions of geodesic convexity and Lipschitz smoothness. Finally, we recall the multi-view hypergraph spectral clustering task, and evaluate the proposed approach on 3sources data sets. The numerical results validate the superior performance over Euclidean and manifold-based baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications (JOTA), under review. 25 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)</p></details> |

We first recast adaptive conformal inference (ACI, Gibbs and Cand\`es, 2021) as a repeated two-player vector-valued finite game and characterize attainable coverage--efficiency tradeoffs. We then construct coverage and efficiency objectives under potential restrictions on the adversary's play, and design a calibration-based approachability strategy to achieve these goals. The resulting algorithm enjoys strong theoretical guarantees and provides practical insights, though its computational burden may limit deployment in practice.</p></details> | 25 pages, 0 figures |

However, the architecture of these controllers introduces new potential attack surfaces that have thus far received inadequate attention. In response to these concerns, we introduce Ambusher, a testing tool designed to discover vulnerabilities within protocols used in distributed SDN controllers. Ambusher achieves this by leveraging protocol state fuzzing, which systematically finds attack scenarios based on an inferred state machine. Since learning states from a cluster is complicated, Ambusher proposes a novel methodology that extracts a single and relatively simple state machine, achieving efficient state-based fuzzing. Our evaluation of Ambusher, conducted on a real SD-WAN deployment spanning two campus networks and one enterprise network, illustrates its ability to uncover 6 potential vulnerabilities in the widely used distributed controller platform.</p></details> | 17 pages, 16 figures |

Approximate methods such as variational inference (VI), inducing points (sparse GPs), low-rank factorizations (RFFs), local factorizations and approximations (INLA), improve scalability but trade off accuracy or flexibility. We introduce DeepRV, a neural-network surrogate that closely matches full GP accuracy including hyperparameter estimates, while reducing computational complexity to $O(N^2)$, increasing scalability and inference speed. DeepRV serves as a drop-in replacement for GP prior realisations in e.g. MCMC-based probabilistic programming pipelines, preserving full model flexibility. Across simulated benchmarks, non-separable spatiotemporal GPs, and a real-world application to education deprivation in London (n = 4,994 locations), DeepRV achieves the highest fidelity to exact GPs while substantially accelerating inference. Code is provided in the accompanying ZIP archive, with all experiments run on a single consumer-grade GPU to ensure accessibility for practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code to reproduce all experiments is available in the ancillary file deep_rv_code, with instructions in the included README</p></details> |

However, no causal discovery methods currently incorporate explainability into their models to derive the causal graphs. Thus, in this paper we explore this innovative approach, as it offers substantial potential and represents a promising new direction worth investigating. Specifically, we introduce ReX, a causal discovery method that leverages machine learning (ML) models coupled with explainability techniques, specifically Shapley values, to identify and interpret significant causal relationships among variables. Comparative evaluations on synthetic datasets comprising continuous tabular data reveal that ReX outperforms state-of-the-art causal discovery methods across diverse data generation processes, including non-linear and additive noise models. Moreover, ReX was tested on the Sachs single-cell protein-signaling dataset, achieving a precision of 0.952 and recovering key causal relationships with no incorrect edges. Taking together, these results showcase ReX's effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures while minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse datasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and explainability techniques with causal discovery, ReX bridges the gap between predictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for understanding complex causal structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 30 figures, Published in Elsevier's Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

But they commonly operate in remote, dynamic and hazardous environments, requiring rapid in-mission adaptation without reliance on fragile or slow communication links to centralised compute. Fast, on-board replanning algorithms are therefore needed to enhance resilience. Reinforcement Learning shows strong promise for efficiently solving mission planning tasks when formulated as Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs), but existing methods: 1) are unsuitable for replanning, where agents do not start at a single location; 2) do not allow cooperation between agents; 3) are unable to model tasks with variable durations; or 4) lack practical considerations for on-board deployment. Here we define the Cooperative Mission Replanning Problem as a novel variant of multiple TSP with adaptations to overcome these issues, and develop a new encoder/decoder-based model using Graph Attention Networks and Attention Models to solve it effectively and efficiently. Using a simple example of cooperative drones, we show our replanner consistently (90% of the time) maintains performance within 10% of the state-of-the-art LKH3 heuristic solver, whilst running 85-370 times faster on a Raspberry Pi. This work paves the way for increased resilience in autonomous multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The central module, ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer, QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g., velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

| **[CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical Contrastive Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23379v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, 27 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce, and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs -- struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks, reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as training data for supervised finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 16 figures, website: http://proof-optimizer.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18400v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of 9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved 99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This study was presented at the 3rd International Conference on Advances and Innovations in Engineering (ICAIE) and published in the conference proceedings</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models. Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage, and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables (WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10 compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks, motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs and its real-time science applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Upgrading to the latest hardware is often infeasible, making sustainable use of existing, mixed-generation resources essential. In this paper, we propose a learning-based architecture for managing machine learning workloads in heterogeneous clusters. The system operates online, allocating resources to incoming training or inference requests while minimizing energy consumption and meeting performance requirements. It uses two neural networks: the first provides initial estimates of how well a new model will utilize different hardware types and how it will affect co-located models. An optimizer then allocates resources based on these estimates. After deployment, the system monitors real performance and uses this data to refine its predictions via a second neural network. This updated model improves estimates not only for the current hardware but also for hardware not initially allocated and for co-location scenarios not yet observed. The result is an adaptive, iterative approach that learns over time to make more effective resource allocation decisions in heterogeneous deep learning clusters.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Extremely memory-efficient model architectures are decisive to fit within an MCU's tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. However, inference latency must remain small to fit real-time constraints. An approach to tackle this is patch-based fusion, which aims to optimize data flows across neural network layers. In this paper, we introduce msf-CNN, a novel technique that efficiently finds optimal fusion settings for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by walking through the fusion solution space represented as a directed acyclic graph. Compared to previous work on CNN fusion for MCUs, msf-CNN identifies a wider set of solutions. We published an implementation of msf-CNN running on various microcontrollers (ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32). We show that msf-CNN can achieve inference using 50% less RAM compared to the prior art (MCUNetV2 and StreamNet). We thus demonstrate how msf-CNN offers additional flexibility for system designers.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (poster)</p></details> |

In this paper, we present an ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

We introduce a general-purpose drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.</p></details> | polishing |

While embedded FPGAs have demonstrated performance and energy efficiency in traditional deep neural networks, their potential for LLM inference remains largely unexplored. Recent efforts to deploy LLMs on FPGAs have primarily relied on large, expensive cloud-grade hardware and have only shown promising results on relatively small LLMs, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we present Hummingbird, a novel FPGA accelerator designed specifically for LLM inference on embedded FPGAs. Hummingbird is smaller, targeting embedded FPGAs such as the KV260 and ZCU104 with 67% LUT, 39% DSP, and 42% power savings over existing research. Hummingbird is stronger, targeting LLaMA3-8B and supporting longer contexts, overcoming the typical 4GB memory constraint of embedded FPGAs through offloading strategies. Finally, Hummingbird is faste, achieving 4.8 tokens/s and 8.6 tokens/s for LLaMA3-8B on the KV260 and ZCU104 respectively, with 93-94% model bandwidth utilization, outperforming the prior 4.9 token/s for LLaMA2-7B with 84% bandwidth utilization baseline. We further demonstrate the viability of industrial applications by deploying Hummingbird on a cost-optimized Spartan UltraScale FPGA, paving the way for affordable LLM solutions at the edge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCAD2025</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs) act as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.</p></details> | 22 pages |

We establish a novel theoretical framework for analyzing VI convergence by exploiting the exponential family structure of distributions. We express negative ELBO as a Bregman divergence with respect to the log-partition function, enabling a geometric analysis of the optimization landscape. We show that this Bregman representation admits a weak monotonicity property that, while weaker than convexity, provides sufficient structure for rigorous convergence analysis. By deriving bounds on the objective function along rays in parameter space, we establish properties governed by the spectral characteristics of the Fisher information matrix. Under this geometric framework, we prove non-asymptotic convergence rates for gradient descent algorithms with both constant and diminishing step sizes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints, enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values (M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures.

| **[LinEAS: End-to-end Learning of Activation Steering with a Distributional Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10679v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient mechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or provide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms should require low volume of unpaired data (i.e., without explicit preference), and should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap, these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layer-wise distributional shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron selection. LinEAS only requires a handful of unpaired samples to be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation in language models, becoming competitive with oracle-dependent methods that have access to strong supervision. LinEAS is modality-agnostic and we empirically find that it outperforms existing activation steering methods at mitigating and including new concepts at the output of single-step text-to-image generation models.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

TMs, known for their energy efficiency, interpretability, and suitability for edge computing, have previously been limited by the rigidity of conventional silicon-based chips. We develop two TM inference models as FlexICs: one achieving 98.5% accuracy using 6800 NAND2 equivalent logic gates with an area of 8X8 mm2, and a second more compact version achieving slightly lower prediction accuracy of 93% but using only 1420 NAND2 equivalent gates with an area of 4X4 mm2, both of which are custom-designed for an 8X8-pixel handwritten digit recognition dataset. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of deploying flexible TM inference engines into wearable healthcare and edge computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by International Symposium on the Tsetlin Machine (ISTM) 2025</p></details> |

At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://genie-envisioner.github.io/</p></details> |

However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods - ranging from rule-based heuristics to reinforcement learning (RL) - often struggle to generalize to complex, dynamic, and safety-critical scenarios. We introduce VLMLight, a novel TSC framework that integrates vision-language meta-control with dual-branch reasoning. At the core of VLMLight is the first image-based traffic simulator that enables multi-view visual perception at intersections, allowing policies to reason over rich cues such as vehicle type, motion, and spatial density. A large language model (LLM) serves as a safety-prioritized meta-controller, selecting between a fast RL policy for routine traffic and a structured reasoning branch for critical cases. In the latter, multiple LLM agents collaborate to assess traffic phases, prioritize emergency vehicles, and verify rule compliance. Experiments show that VLMLight reduces waiting times for emergency vehicles by up to 65% over RL-only systems, while preserving real-time performance in standard conditions with less than 1% degradation. VLMLight offers a scalable, interpretable, and safety-aware solution for next-generation traffic signal control.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Theoretical Study on Bridging Internal Probability and Self-Consistency for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15444v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%.

To address these challenges, we propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000 accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road safety planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures, The 8th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on AI for Geographic Knowledge Discovery (GeoAI '25), November 3--6, 2025, Minneapolis, MN, USA</p></details> |

Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and model are available at https://github.com/M-E-AGI-Lab/Muddit</p></details> |
| **[When Seeing Is not Enough: Revealing the Limits of Active Reasoning in MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15421v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities across a broad range of benchmarks. However, most existing evaluations focus on passive inference, where models perform step-by-step reasoning under complete information. This setup is misaligned with real-world use, where seeing is not enough. This raises a fundamental question: Can MLLMs actively acquire missing evidence under incomplete information? To bridge this gap, we require the MLLMs to actively acquire missing evidence and iteratively refine decisions under incomplete information, by selecting a target image from a candidate pool without task-specific priors. To support systematic study, we propose GuessBench, a benchmark with both perception-oriented and knowledge-oriented images for evaluating active reasoning in MLLMs. We evaluate 20 superior MLLMs and find that performance on active reasoning lags far behind it on passive settings, indicating substantial room for improvement. Further analysis identifies fine-grained perception and timely decision-making as key challenges. Ablation studies show that perceptual enhancements benefit smaller models, whereas thinking-oriented methods provide consistent gains across model sizes. These results suggest promising directions for future research on multimodal active reasoning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

Unlike property-preserving encryption-based systems such as CryptDB, which rely on deterministic or order-preserving encryption and are vulnerable to frequency, order, and equality-pattern inference attacks, FHE-SQL performs computations entirely under encryption, eliminating these leakage channels. Compared to trusted-hardware approaches such as TrustedDB, which depend on a hardware security module and thus inherit its trust and side-channel limitations, our design achieves end-to-end cryptographic protection without requiring trusted execution environments. In contrast to high-performance FHE-based engines-Hermes, which target specialized workloads such as vector search, FHE-SQL supports general SQL query semantics with schema-aware, type-safe definitions suitable for relational data management. FHE-SQL mitigates the high cost of ciphertext space by using an indirection architecture that separates metadata in RocksDB from large ciphertexts in blob storage. It supports oblivious selection via homomorphic boolean masks, multi-tier caching, and garbage collection, with security proven under the Universal Composability framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figures, Keywords: Fully Homomorphic Encryption, Private Information Retrieval, Encrypted Databases, Privacy-Preserving Systems</p></details> |
| **[Mind the Gap: Navigating Inference with Optimal Transport Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08867v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently enabled enormous gains in sensitivity to new phenomena across the sciences. In particle physics, much of this progress has relied on excellent simulations of a wide range of physical processes. However, due to the sophistication of modern machine learning algorithms and their reliance on high-quality training samples, discrepancies between simulation and experimental data can significantly limit their effectiveness. In this work, we present a solution to this ``misspecification'' problem: a model calibration approach based on optimal transport, which we apply to high-dimensional simulations for the first time. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through jet tagging, using a dataset inspired by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. A 128-dimensional internal jet representation from a powerful general-purpose classifier is studied; after calibrating this internal ``latent'' representation, we find that a wide variety of quantities derived from it for downstream tasks are also properly calibrated: using this calibrated high-dimensional representation, powerful new applications of jet flavor information can be utilized in LHC analyses. This is a key step toward allowing the unbiased use of ``foundation models'' in particle physics. More broadly, this calibration framework has broad applications for correcting high-dimensional simulations across the sciences.</p></details> | 31 pages, 13 figures |
| **[What Layers When: Learning to Skip Compute in LLMs with Residual Gates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13876v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15% compute while retaining over 90% of baseline accuracy. For increasingly larger models, this tradeoff improves drastically. On instruction-tuned models we see accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50% savings. The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization, pruning, and self-speculative decoding.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[PAFT: Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12859v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often causes overfitting to specific prompt wording, where minor phrasing variations drastically reduce performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning (PAFT), a method that enhances robustness through dynamic prompt variation during training. PAFT first generates diverse synthetic prompts, then continuously samples from this set to construct training instances, forcing models to learn fundamental task principles rather than surface-level patterns. Across systematic evaluations using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT), PAFT demonstrates substantially improved prompt robustness, achieving 7% higher generalization accuracy on unseen prompts than standard methods. In addition to enhanced robustness, PAFT consistently yields superior overall performance on established benchmarks for question answering, mathematical reasoning, and tool use. Notably, models trained with PAFT attain 3.2 faster inference speeds due to reduced prompt sensitivity. Ablation studies further validate effectiveness of PAFT, while theoretical analysis reveals that PAFT can effectively enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of LLM.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint \underline{c}ompression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high \underline{a}ccuracy, fast \underline{i}nference speed, and favorable \underline{t}ransferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI 2025 Camera-ready Version</p></details> |

However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where "Prefix" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in the original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications.

Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP. When transferring to COCO, YOLOE-v8-L achieves 0.6 AP$^b$ and 0.4 AP$^m$ gains over closed-set YOLOv8-L with nearly 4$\times$ less training time.

Although existing monocular clothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often rely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free environment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these algorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions. Additionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage geometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are extremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel pipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview consistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth geometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a multiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from the occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly enforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is then trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded input and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive and accurate 3D representation. CHROME achieves significant improvements in terms of both novel view synthesis (upto 3 db PSNR) and geometric reconstruction under challenging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

In particular, aggregating models' next-token probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers, its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability, we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500 and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of tokens.</p></details> | preprint |

| **[LumiTex: Towards High-Fidelity PBR Texture Generation with Illumination Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19437v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physically-based rendering (PBR) provides a principled standard for realistic material-lighting interactions in computer graphics. Despite recent advances in generating PBR textures, existing methods fail to address two fundamental challenges: 1) materials decomposition from image prompts under limited illumination cues, and 2) seamless and view-consistent texture completion. To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LumiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in texture quality, surpassing both existing open-source and commercial methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lumitex.vercel.app</p></details> |
| **[Are Image-to-Video Models Good Zero-Shot Image Editors?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19435v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video diffusion models show strong world simulation and temporal reasoning abilities, but their use as zero-shot image editors remains underexplored. We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Breaking the Likelihood-Quality Trade-off in Diffusion Models by Merging Pretrained Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19434v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 DeLTa workshop</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Horizons in Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19433v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

| **[Cloud4D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19431v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

| **[Cognitive Foundations for Reasoning and Their Manifestation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16660v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning & knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Cook and Clean Together: Teaching Embodied Agents for Parallel Task Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19430v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task scheduling is critical for embodied AI, enabling agents to follow natural language instructions and execute actions efficiently in 3D physical worlds. However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency.

| **[Beyond Protein Language Models: An Agentic LLM Framework for Mechanistic Enzyme Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19423v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Chain-of-Visual-Thought: Teaching VLMs to See and Think Better with Continuous Visual Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19418v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wakalsprojectpage.github.io/comt-website/</p></details> |
| **[SING: SDE Inference via Natural Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17796v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable, motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI). However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from slow convergence and numerical instability. We propose SDE Inference via Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We provide theoretical guarantees that SING approximately optimizes the intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets, including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Advances in Neural Processing Information Systems (NeurIPS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Bayesian spectral analysis of multiple stationary time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19406v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The power spectrum of biomedical time series provides important indirect measurements of physiological processes underlying health and biological functions. However, simultaneously characterizing power spectra for multiple time series remains challenging due to extra spectral variability and varying time series lengths. We propose a method for hierarchical Bayesian estimation of stationary time series (HBEST) that provides an interpretable framework for efficiently modeling multiple power spectra. HBEST models log power spectra using a truncated cosine basis expansion with a novel global-local coefficient decomposition, enabling simultaneous estimation of population-level and individual-level power spectra and accommodating time series of varying lengths. The fully Bayesian framework provides shrinkage priors for regularized estimation and efficient information sharing. Simulations demonstrate HBEST's advantages over competing methods in computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. An application to heart rate variability time series demonstrates HBEST's ability to accurately characterize power spectra and capture associations with traditional cardiovascular risk factors.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SAQR-QC: A Logic for Scalable but Approximate Quantitative Reasoning about Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13635v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about quantum programs remains a fundamental challenge, regardless of the programming model or computational paradigm. Despite extensive research, existing verification techniques are insufficient -- even for quantum circuits, a deliberately restricted model that lacks classical control, but still underpins many current quantum algorithms. Many existing formal methods require exponential time and space to represent and manipulate (representations of) assertions and judgments, making them impractical for quantum circuits with many qubits. This paper presents a logic for reasoning in such settings, called SAQR-QC. The logic supports {S}calable but {A}pproximate {Q}uantitative {R}easoning about {Q}uantum {C}ircuits, whence the name. SAQR-QC has three characteristics: (i) some (deliberate) loss of precision is built into it; (ii) it has a mechanism to help the accumulated loss of precision during a sequence of reasoning steps remain small; and (iii) most importantly, to make reasoning scalable, every reasoning step is local -- i.e., it involves just a small number of qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAQR-QC via two case studies: the verification of GHZ circuits involving non-Clifford gates, and the analysis of quantum phase estimation -- a core subroutine in Shor's factoring algorithm.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[Communicating Plans, Not Percepts: Scalable Multi-Agent Coordination with Embodied World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02912v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust coordination is critical for effective decision-making in multi-agent systems, especially under partial observability. A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

| **[Information Extraction From Fiscal Documents Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10659v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text comprehension, but their ability to process complex, hierarchical tabular data remains underexplored. We present a novel approach to extracting structured data from multi-page government fiscal documents using LLM-based techniques. Applied to annual fiscal documents from the State of Karnataka in India (200+ pages), our method achieves high accuracy through a multi-stage pipeline that leverages domain knowledge, sequential context, and algorithmic validation. A large challenge with traditional OCR methods is the inability to verify the accurate extraction of numbers. When applied to fiscal data, the inherent structure of fiscal tables, with totals at each level of the hierarchy, allows for robust internal validation of the extracted data. We use these hierarchical relationships to create multi-level validation checks. We demonstrate that LLMs can read tables and also process document-specific structural hierarchies, offering a scalable process for converting PDF-based fiscal disclosures into research-ready databases. Our implementation shows promise for broader applications across developing country contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

| **[UISearch: Graph-Based Embeddings for Multimodal Enterprise UI Screenshots Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19380v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enterprise software companies maintain thousands of user interface screens across products and versions, creating critical challenges for design consistency, pattern discovery, and compliance check. Existing approaches rely on visual similarity or text semantics, lacking explicit modeling of structural properties fundamental to user interface (UI) composition. We present a novel graph-based representation that converts UI screenshots into attributed graphs encoding hierarchical relationships and spatial arrangements, potentially generalizable to document layouts, architectural diagrams, and other structured visual domains. A contrastive graph autoencoder learns embeddings preserving multi-level similarity across visual, structural, and semantic properties. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that our structural embeddings achieve better discriminative power than state-of-the-art Vision Encoders, representing a fundamental advance in the expressiveness of the UI representation. We implement this representation in UISearch, a multi-modal search framework that combines structural embeddings with semantic search through a composable query language. On 20,396 financial software UIs, UISearch achieves 0.92 Top-5 accuracy with 47.5ms median latency (P95: 124ms), scaling to 20,000+ screens. The hybrid indexing architecture enables complex queries and supports fine-grained UI distinction impossible with vision-only approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 3 algorithms, 4 tables</p></details> |

We systematically evaluate this framework on a simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AgenticSE Workshop at ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[SketchDeco: Training-Free Latent Composition for Precise Sketch Colourisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18716v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SketchDeco, a training-free approach to sketch colourisation that bridges the gap between professional design needs and intuitive, region-based control. Our method empowers artists to use simple masks and colour palettes for precise spatial and chromatic specification, avoiding both the tediousness of manual assignment and the ambiguity of text-based prompts. We reformulate this task as a novel, training-free composition problem. Our core technical contribution is a guided latent-space blending process: we first leverage diffusion inversion to precisely ``paint'' user-defined colours into specified regions, and then use a custom self-attention mechanism to harmoniously blend these local edits with a globally consistent base image. This ensures both local colour fidelity and global harmony without requiring any model fine-tuning. Our system produces high-quality results in 15--20 inference steps on consumer GPUs, making professional-quality, controllable colourisation accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: \url{https://chaitron.github.io/SketchDeco/}</p></details> |

Statistical depth functions are powerful tools for analyzing centrality and ranking in multivariate and functional data, yet existing depth notions for TPPs remain limited. In this paper, we propose a novel product depth specifically designed for TPPs observed only up to the first k events. Our depth function comprises two key components: a normalized marginal depth, which captures the temporal distribution of the final event, and a conditional depth, which characterizes the joint distribution of the preceding events. We establish its key theoretical properties and demonstrate its practical utility through simulation studies and real data applications.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |
| **[ALMAS: an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03463v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been leading the way in applied LLM research across a number of fields. One notable area is software development, where researchers have advanced the automation of code implementation, code testing, code maintenance, inter alia, using LLM agents. However, software development is a multifaceted environment that extends beyond just code. As such, a successful LLM system must factor in multiple stages of the software development life-cycle (SDLC). In this paper, we propose a vision for ALMAS, an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering framework, which follows the above SDLC philosophy such that it may work within an agile software development team to perform several tasks end-to-end. ALMAS aligns its agents with agile roles, and can be used in a modular fashion to seamlessly integrate with human developers and their development environment.

| **[LLM-Driven Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstrations for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Mobile Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19368v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications. While MARL enables decentralized deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, it suffers from severe non-stationarity due to the synchronous updates of agent policies. This non stationarity results in unstable training and poor policy con vergence, especially as the number of agents increases. In this paper, we propose RELED, a scalable MARL framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven expert demonstrations with autonomous agent exploration. RELED incorporates a Stationarity-Aware Expert Demonstration module, which leverages theoretical non-stationarity bounds to enhance the quality of LLM-generated expert trajectories, thus providing high reward and training-stable samples for each agent. Moreover, a Hybrid Expert-Agent Policy Optimization module adaptively balances each agent's learning from both expert-generated and agent-generated trajectories, accelerating policy convergence and improving generalization. Extensive experiments with real city networks based on OpenStreetMap demonstrate that RELED achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[DeCo: Frequency-Decoupled Pixel Diffusion for End-to-End Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19365v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison.

| **[Neural surrogates for designing gravitational wave detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19364v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics simulators are essential in science and engineering, enabling the analysis, control, and design of complex systems. In experimental sciences, they are increasingly used to automate experimental design, often via combinatorial search and optimization. However, as the setups grow more complex, the computational cost of traditional, CPU-based simulators becomes a major limitation. Here, we show how neural surrogate models can significantly reduce reliance on such slow simulators while preserving accuracy. Taking the design of interferometric gravitational wave detectors as a representative example, we train a neural network to surrogate the gravitational wave physics simulator Finesse, which was developed by the LIGO community. Despite that small changes in physical parameters can change the output by orders of magnitudes, the model rapidly predicts the quality and feasibility of candidate designs, allowing an efficient exploration of large design spaces. Our algorithm loops between training the surrogate, inverse designing new experiments, and verifying their properties with the slow simulator for further training. Assisted by auto-differentiation and GPU parallelism, our method proposes high-quality experiments much faster than direct optimization. Solutions that our algorithm finds within hours outperform designs that take five days for the optimizer to reach. Though shown in the context of gravitational wave detectors, our framework is broadly applicable to other domains where simulator bottlenecks hinder optimization and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLM Agents for Automated Dependency Upgrades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03480v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a codebase expands over time, its library dependencies can become outdated and require updates to maintain innovation and security. However, updating a library can introduce breaking changes in the code, necessitating significant developer time for maintenance. To address this, we introduce a framework of LLM agents to be used in combination with migration documentation to automatically recommend and apply code updates and ensure compatibility with new versions. Our solution can automatically localize updated library usages in live Java codebases and implement recommended fixes in a user-friendly manner. The system architecture consists of multiple key components: a Summary Agent, Control Agent, and Code Agent. To validate our approach, we apply the framework on an industrial use case by which we create three synthetic code repositories with major Upgrade changes and benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Results show that our approach not only performs upgrades using fewer tokens across all cases but also achieves a precision of 71.4%, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AISM Workshop at ASE 2005</p></details> |

However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$). Our results underscore the value of the dataset and the benchmarking framework for driving progress in automated cell counting and provide a robust foundation for future research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19344v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant progress in continual learning ranging from architectural novelty to clever strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting most existing methods rest on a strong but unrealistic assumption the availability of labeled data throughout the learning process. In real-world scenarios, however, data often arrives sequentially and without annotations, rendering conventional approaches impractical. In this work, we revisit the fundamental assumptions of continual learning and ask: Can current systems adapt when labels are absent and tasks emerge incrementally over time? To this end, we introduce Annotation-Free Class-Incremental Learning (AFCIL), a more realistic and challenging paradigm where unlabeled data arrives continuously, and the learner must incrementally acquire new classes without any supervision. To enable effective learning under AFCIL, we propose CrossWorld CL, a Cross Domain World Guided Continual Learning framework that incorporates external world knowledge as a stable auxiliary source. The method retrieves semantically related ImageNet classes for each downstream category, maps downstream and ImageNet features through a cross domain alignment strategy and finally introduce a novel replay strategy. This design lets the model uncover semantic structure without annotations while keeping earlier knowledge intact. Across four datasets, CrossWorld-CL surpasses CLIP baselines and existing continual and unlabeled learning methods, underscoring the benefit of world knowledge for annotation free continual learning.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Figures, Accepted at the 17th International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR) 2025</p></details> |

Almost as long-standing is a general idea for addressing this challenge: Parsing text to a symbolic representation, and generating from it. However, earlier approaches were hindered by parsing and generation insufficiencies. Using modern parsers and a safety supervision mechanism, we show how close current methods come to this goal. Concretely, we propose the Sentence Smith framework for English, which has three steps: 1. Parsing a sentence into a semantic graph. 2. Applying human-designed semantic manipulation rules. 3. Generating text from the manipulated graph. A final entailment check (4.) verifies the validity of the applied transformation. To demonstrate our framework's utility, we use it to induce hard negative text pairs that challenge text embedding models. Since the controllable generation makes it possible to clearly isolate different types of semantic shifts, we can evaluate text embedding models in a fine-grained way, also addressing an issue in current benchmarking where linguistic phenomena remain opaque. Human validation confirms that our transparent generation process produces texts of good quality. Notably, our way of generation is very resource-efficient, since it relies only on smaller neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (main), this version fixes a subscript typo in Eq 1</p></details> |

The ensuing model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a candidate mechanism for agent governance in AI systems, that is, the (auto)regulation of AI agents themselves rather than human actors in the AI industry. We propose that lawful and norm-sensitive AI behavior can be achieved through regulation by design, where agents are endowed with intentional control systems, or behavioral safety valves, that guide real-time decisions in accordance with normative expectations. To illustrate this, we simulate an autonomous driving scenario in which an AI agent must decide when to yield the right of way by balancing competing legal and pragmatic imperatives. The model formalizes how AIF can implement context-dependent preferences to resolve such conflicts, linking this mechanism to the conception of law as a scaffold for rational decision-making under uncertainty. We conclude by discussing how context-dependent preferences could function as safety mechanisms for autonomous agents, enhancing lawful alignment and risk mitigation in AI governance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 1 box</p></details> |
| **[Targeted Manipulation: Slope-Based Attacks on Financial Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19330v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, preprint; Total including Appendix: 21 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Mixture of Horizons in Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19433v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

| **[Cognitive Foundations for Reasoning and Their Manifestation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16660v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. To understand this gap, we synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning reasoning invariants, meta-cognitive controls, representations for organizing reasoning & knowledge, and transformation operations. We introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale empirical analysis of 192K traces from 18 models across text, vision, and audio, complemented by 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. We find that models under-utilize cognitive elements correlated with success, narrowing to rigid sequential processing on ill-structured problems where diverse representations and meta-cognitive monitoring are critical. Human traces show more abstraction and conceptual processing, while models default to surface-level enumeration. Meta-analysis of 1.6K LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable elements (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) but neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 66.7% on complex problems. By establishing a shared vocabulary between cognitive science and LLM research, our framework enables systematic diagnosis of reasoning failures and principled development of models that reason through robust cognitive mechanisms rather than spurious shortcuts, while providing tools to test theories of human cognition at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

A central question in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is whether to engineer communication protocols or learn them end-to-end. We investigate this dichotomy using embodied world models. We propose and compare two communication strategies for a cooperative task-allocation problem. The first, Learned Direct Communication (LDC), learns a protocol end-to-end. The second, Intention Communication, uses an engineered inductive bias: a compact, learned world model, the Imagined Trajectory Generation Module (ITGM), which uses the agent's own policy to simulate future states. A Message Generation Network (MGN) then compresses this plan into a message. We evaluate these approaches on goal-directed interaction in a grid world, a canonical abstraction for embodied AI problems, while scaling environmental complexity. Our experiments reveal that while emergent communication is viable in simple settings, the engineered, world model-based approach shows superior performance, sample efficiency, and scalability as complexity increases. These findings advocate for integrating structured, predictive models into MARL agents to enable active, goal-driven coordination.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA).

In particular, the analytical expressions of the asymptotic behavior of the weighted sample trace moments of generalized inverse matrices are deduced in terms of the partial exponential Bell polynomials which can be easily computed in practice. The existent results for pseudo-inverses are extended in several directions: (i) First, the population covariance matrix is not assumed to be a multiple of the identity matrix; (ii) Second, the assumption of normality is not used in the derivation; (iii) Third, the asymptotic results are derived under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Our findings provide universal methodology for construction of fully data-driven improved shrinkage estimators of the precision matrix, optimal portfolio weights and beyond. It is found that the Moore-Penrose inverse acts asymptotically as a certain regularizer of the true covariance matrix and it seems that its proper transformation (shrinkage) performs similarly to or even outperforms the existing benchmarks in many applications, while keeping the computational time as minimal as possible.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 7 figures, revised draft, accepted for publication in the Annals of Statistics</p></details> |
| **[DeCo: Frequency-Decoupled Pixel Diffusion for End-to-End Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19365v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison.

In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training.</p></details> | Preprint |

A Language Neurons Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21505v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some research on language-specific neurons provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs' mechanisms. However, we find that there are many neurons that are shared by multiple but not all languages and cannot be correctly classified. In this work, we propose a ternary classification methodology that categorizes neurons into three types, including language-specific neurons, language-related neurons, and general neurons. And we propose a corresponding identification algorithm to distinguish these different types of neurons. Furthermore, based on the distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1) multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3) multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting. Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of ''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing empirical results and valuable insights to better understand multilingual alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (Oral) |

However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, code: https://github.com/G-JWLee/PRInTS</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (29 with appendix), 8 figures</p></details> |

However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.</p></details> | Accepted at AICS2025 |
| **[Audio Palette: A Diffusion Transformer with Multi-Signal Conditioning for Controllable Foley Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12175v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have enabled high-quality text-to-audio synthesis, but fine-grained acoustic control remains a significant challenge in open-source research. We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this "control gap" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals: loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85 percent of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control. This work establishes a robust foundation for controllable sound design and performative audio synthesis in open-source settings, enabling a more artist-centric workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Artificial Intelligence Technology Research (AITR), Vol. 3, No. 2, December 2025</p></details> |
| **[Constant-Size Certificates for Leader Election in Chordal Graphs and Related Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19208v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In distributed computing a certification scheme consists of a set of states and conditions over those states that enable each node of a graph to efficiently verify the correctness of a solution to a given problem. This work focuses on two fundamental problems: leader election and spanning tree construction. For each problem, we present a constant-size (per edge), local certification scheme, where the conditions available to each node can only refer to the graph induced by its one-hop neighborhood. In particular, we provide certification schemes for leader election in chordal and $K_4$-free dismantlable graphs and for spanning tree construction in dismantlable graphs, assuming a root is given. For chordal graphs, our leader election certification scheme additionally ensures an acyclic orientation, a property that is not generally verifiable using constant-size certificates in arbitrary graphs. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first local certification results tailored to these graph classes, potentially highlighting structural properties useful for verifying additional problems. Finally, we propose an algorithm that automatically transforms any certification scheme into a silent self-stabilizing algorithm (i.e., an algorithm that automatically recovers from faults) by adding only one extra state to the set of states of the certification scheme, assuming a Gouda fair scheduler. This transformation may be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, under review</p></details> |

However, the resource-consuming reasoning processes may be exploited by attackers to maliciously occupy the resources of the servers, leading to a crash, like the DDoS attack in cyber. To this end, we propose a novel attack method on LRMs termed ExtendAttack to maliciously occupy the resources of servers by stealthily extending the reasoning processes of LRMs. Concretely, we systematically obfuscate characters within a benign prompt, transforming them into a complex, poly-base ASCII representation. This compels the model to perform a series of computationally intensive decoding sub-tasks that are deeply embedded within the semantic structure of the query itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ExtendAttack. Remarkably, it significantly increases response length and latency, with the former increasing by over 2.7 times for the o3 model on the HumanEval benchmark. Besides, it preserves the original meaning of the query and achieves comparable answer accuracy, showing the stealthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[Benchmarking the Spatial Robustness of DNNs via Natural and Adversarial Localized Corruptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01632v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The robustness of deep neural networks is a crucial factor in safety-critical applications, particularly in complex and dynamic environments (e.g., medical or driving scenarios) where localized corruptions can arise. While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remains underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing novel, region-aware metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, along with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of natural localized corruptions. Furthermore, it uncovers the inherent complexity of evaluating worst-case spatial robustness using only a single localized adversarial attack. To address this, the work proposes a region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis to systematically assess model robustness across specific image regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones, and vice versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, adapting REPA to U-Net architectures presents unique challenges: (1) different block functionalities necessitate revised alignment strategies; (2) spatial-dimension inconsistencies emerge from U-Net's spatial downsampling operations; (3) space gaps between U-Net and ViT hinder the effectiveness of tokenwise alignment. To encounter these challenges, we propose \textbf{U-REPA}, a representation alignment paradigm that bridges U-Net hidden states and ViT features as follows: Firstly, we propose via observation that due to skip connection, the middle stage of U-Net is the best alignment option. Secondly, we propose upsampling of U-Net features after passing them through MLPs. Thirdly, we observe difficulty when performing tokenwise similarity alignment, and further introduces a manifold loss that regularizes the relative similarity between samples. Experiments indicate that the resulting U-REPA could achieve excellent generation quality and greatly accelerates the convergence speed. With CFG guidance interval, U-REPA could reach $FID<1.5$ in 200 epochs or 1M iterations on ImageNet 256 $\times$ 256, and needs only half the total epochs to perform better than REPA under sd-vae-ft-ema.

In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 17 figures, 8 tables,</p></details> |

Although the success of large language models highlights the importance of these laws, their application to deep regression models remains largely unexplored. Here, we empirically investigate neural scaling laws in deep regression using a parameter estimation model for twisted van der Waals magnets. We observe power-law relationships between the loss and both training dataset size and model capacity across a wide range of values, employing various architectures--including fully connected networks, residual networks, and vision transformers. Furthermore, the scaling exponents governing these relationships range from 1 to 2, with specific values depending on the regressed parameters and model details. The consistent scaling behaviors and their large scaling exponents suggest that the performance of deep regression models can improve substantially with increasing data size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary Information will be provided with the published manuscript</p></details> |

Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

This study compared three Japanese models--BERT Base, JMedRoBERTa, and ModernBERT--for multi-label classification of 18 chest CT findings. Using the CT-RATE-JPN dataset, all models were fine-tuned under identical conditions. ModernBERT showed clear efficiency advantages, producing substantially fewer tokens and achieving faster training and inference than the other models while maintaining comparable performance on the internal test dataset (exact match accuracy: 74.7% vs. 72.7% for BERT Base). To assess generalizability, we additionally constructed RR-Findings, an external dataset of 243 naturally written Japanese radiology reports annotated using the same schema. Under this domain-shifted setting, performance differences became pronounced: BERT Base outperformed both JMedRoBERTa and ModernBERT, whereas ModernBERT showed the largest decline in exact match accuracy. Average precision differences were smaller, indicating that ModernBERT retained reasonable ranking ability despite reduced calibration. Overall, ModernBERT offers substantial computational efficiency and strong in-domain performance but remains sensitive to real-world linguistic variability. These results highlight the need for more diverse natural-language training data and domain-specific calibration strategies to improve robustness when deploying modern transformer models in heterogeneous clinical environments.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Existing multi-scale approaches alleviate this issue by integrating hierarchical or hybrid features; however, they rely on fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation. To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, α and \b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |

However, most existing methods focus solely on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities, significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose Warm Chat, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission is withdrawn at the request of the authors due to internal reasons within the research team</p></details> |

Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>24-pa...</summary><p>24-page manuscript accepted to IJCV</p></details> |

However, its high computational and memory costs are a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Q-SAM2, an accurate low-bit quantization method that achieves high compression and high fidelity. To address performance degradation arising from challenging weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel contributions: Variance-Reduced Calibration (VRC), an initialization method that reduces weight statistical variance by minimizing the Frobenius norm over a small calibration batch; and Learnable Statistical Clipping (LSC), a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that learns momentum-stabilized clipping factors to manage outliers in weights and activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference with substantial efficiency gains, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art general QAT schemes, particularly in the ultra-low 2-bit regime. Specifically, Q-SAM2 achieves an accuracy gain of up to 9.7 ppt in J&F on the video segmentation benchmark and 7.3 ppt in mIoU for instance segmentation over the best competing QAT model, all while achieving an 8x reduction in model size compared to the BF16 baseline.</p></details> | 22 pages |

While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Entropy-Guided Reasoning Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14258v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.</p></details> | 10pages, 4 figures |

However, the significant computational overhead of processing redundant visual tokens remains a critical bottleneck for real-time robotic deployment. While standard token pruning techniques can alleviate this, these task-agnostic methods struggle to preserve task-critical visual information. To address this challenge, simultaneously preserving both the holistic context and fine-grained details for precise action, we propose Compressor-VLA, a novel hybrid instruction-conditioned token compression framework designed for efficient, task-oriented compression of visual information in VLA models. The proposed Compressor-VLA framework consists of two token compression modules: a Semantic Task Compressor (STC) that distills holistic, task-relevant context, and a Spatial Refinement Compressor (SRC) that preserves fine-grained spatial details. This compression is dynamically modulated by the natural language instruction, allowing for the adaptive condensation of task-relevant visual information. Experimentally, extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compressor-VLA achieves a competitive success rate on the LIBERO benchmark while reducing FLOPs by 59% and the visual token count by over 3x compared to its baseline. The real-robot deployments on a dual-arm robot platform validate the model's sim-to-real transferability and practical applicability. Moreover, qualitative analyses reveal that our instruction guidance dynamically steers the model's perceptual focus toward task-relevant objects, thereby validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

We address the zero-shot cross-subject setting, where no target-subject labels or adaptation are allowed, by introducing novel geometry-aware preprocessing modules and deep congruence networks that operate directly on SPD covariance matrices. Our preprocessing modules, DCR and RiFU, extend Riemannian Alignment by improving action separation while reducing subject-specific distortions. We further propose two manifold classifiers, SPD-DCNet and RiFUNet, which use hierarchical congruence transforms to learn discriminative, subject-invariant covariance representations. On the BCI-IV 2a benchmark, our framework improves cross-subject accuracy by 3-4% over the strongest classical baselines, demonstrating the value of geometry-aware transformations for robust EEG decoding.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

While enabling rich functionalities like activity recognition and step counting, this openness has also enabled unregulated inference of sensitive user traits, such as gender, age, and even identity, without user consent. Existing privacy-preserving techniques, such as GAN-based obfuscation or differential privacy, typically require access to the full input sequence, introducing latency that is incompatible with real-time scenarios. Worse, they tend to distort temporal and semantic patterns, degrading the utility of the data for benign tasks like activity recognition. To address these limitations, we propose the Predictive Adversarial Transformation Network (PATN), a real-time privacy-preserving framework that leverages historical signals to generate adversarial perturbations proactively. The perturbations are applied immediately upon data acquisition, enabling continuous protection without disrupting application functionality. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PATN substantially degrades the performance of privacy inference models, achieving Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 40.11% and 44.65% (reducing inference accuracy to near-random) and increasing the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 8.30% and 7.56% to 41.65% and 46.22%.

| **[Mixture of Horizons in Action Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19433v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown remarkable capabilities in robotic manipulation, but their performance is sensitive to the $\textbf{action chunk length}$ used during training, termed $\textbf{horizon}$. Our empirical study reveals an inherent trade-off: longer horizons provide stronger global foresight but degrade fine-grained accuracy, while shorter ones sharpen local control yet struggle on long-term tasks, implying fixed choice of single horizons being suboptimal. To mitigate the trade-off, we propose a $\textbf{mixture of horizons (MoH)}$ strategy. MoH rearranges the action chunk into several segments with different horizons, processes them in parallel with a shared action transformer, and fuses outputs with a light linear gate. It has three appealing benefits. 1) MoH exploits long-term foresight and short-term precision jointly within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability to complex tasks. 2) MoH is plug-and-play for full-attention action modules with minimal training or inference overhead. 3) MoH enables dynamic inference with adaptive horizons, which selects stable actions through cross-horizon consensus, achieving 2.5$\times$ higher throughput than baselines while preserving superior performance. Extensive experiments over flow-based policies $π_0$, $π_{0.5}$, and one-step regression policy $π_{\text{reg}}$ demonstrate that MoH yields consistent and significant gains on both simulations and real-world tasks. Notably, under mixed-task setting, $π_{0.5}$ with MoH reaches a new state-of-the-art with 99$\%$ average success rate on LIBERO after only $30k$ training iterations.

However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements. Code and data are available on our project page https://cloud4d.jacob-lin.com/.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight, project page: https://cloud4d.jacob-lin.com/</p></details> |
| **[Chain-of-Visual-Thought: Teaching VLMs to See and Think Better with Continuous Visual Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19418v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wakalsprojectpage.github.io/comt-website/</p></details> |
| **[SING: SDE Inference via Natural Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17796v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable, motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI). However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from slow convergence and numerical instability. We propose SDE Inference via Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We provide theoretical guarantees that SING approximately optimizes the intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets, including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Advances in Neural Processing Information Systems (NeurIPS), 2025</p></details> |

| **[SketchDeco: Training-Free Latent Composition for Precise Sketch Colourisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18716v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SketchDeco, a training-free approach to sketch colourisation that bridges the gap between professional design needs and intuitive, region-based control. Our method empowers artists to use simple masks and colour palettes for precise spatial and chromatic specification, avoiding both the tediousness of manual assignment and the ambiguity of text-based prompts. We reformulate this task as a novel, training-free composition problem. Our core technical contribution is a guided latent-space blending process: we first leverage diffusion inversion to precisely ``paint'' user-defined colours into specified regions, and then use a custom self-attention mechanism to harmoniously blend these local edits with a globally consistent base image. This ensures both local colour fidelity and global harmony without requiring any model fine-tuning. Our system produces high-quality results in 15--20 inference steps on consumer GPUs, making professional-quality, controllable colourisation accessible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: \url{https://chaitron.github.io/SketchDeco/}</p></details> |
| **[DeCo: Frequency-Decoupled Pixel Diffusion for End-to-End Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19365v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison.

| **[Explicit Tonal Tension Conditioning via Dual-Level Beam Search for Symbolic Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19342v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art symbolic music generation models have recently achieved remarkable output quality, yet explicit control over compositional features, such as tonal tension, remains challenging. We propose a novel approach that integrates a computational tonal tension model, based on tonal interval vector analysis, into a Transformer framework. Our method employs a two-level beam search strategy during inference. At the token level, generated candidates are re-ranked using model probability and diversity metrics to maintain overall quality. At the bar level, a tension-based re-ranking is applied to ensure that the generated music aligns with a desired tension curve. Objective evaluations indicate that our approach effectively modulates tonal tension, and subjective listening tests confirm that the system produces outputs that align with the target tension. These results demonstrate that explicit tension conditioning through a dual-level beam search provides a powerful and intuitive tool to guide AI-generated music. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our method can generate multiple distinct musical interpretations under the same tension condition.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 Figures, Accepted at the 17th International Symposium on Computer Music Multidisciplinary Research (CMMR) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Normative active inference: A numerical proof of principle for a computational and economic legal analytic approach to AI governance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19334v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a computational account of how legal norms can influence the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, grounded in the active inference framework (AIF) that is informed by principles of economic legal analysis (ELA). The ensuing model aims to capture the complexity of human decision-making under legal constraints, offering a candidate mechanism for agent governance in AI systems, that is, the (auto)regulation of AI agents themselves rather than human actors in the AI industry. We propose that lawful and norm-sensitive AI behavior can be achieved through regulation by design, where agents are endowed with intentional control systems, or behavioral safety valves, that guide real-time decisions in accordance with normative expectations. To illustrate this, we simulate an autonomous driving scenario in which an AI agent must decide when to yield the right of way by balancing competing legal and pragmatic imperatives. The model formalizes how AIF can implement context-dependent preferences to resolve such conflicts, linking this mechanism to the conception of law as a scaffold for rational decision-making under uncertainty. We conclude by discussing how context-dependent preferences could function as safety mechanisms for autonomous agents, enhancing lawful alignment and risk mitigation in AI governance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 1 box</p></details> |
| **[Targeted Manipulation: Slope-Based Attacks on Financial Time-Series Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19330v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common method of attacking deep learning models is through adversarial attacks, which occur when an attacker specifically modifies the input of a model to produce an incorrect result. Adversarial attacks have been deeply investigated in the image domain; however, there is less research in the time-series domain and very little for forecasting financial data. To address these concerns, this study aims to build upon previous research on adversarial attacks for time-series data by introducing two new slope-based methods aimed to alter the trends of the predicted stock forecast generated by an N-HiTS model. Compared to the normal N-HiTS predictions, the two new slope-based methods, the General Slope Attack and Least-Squares Slope Attack, can manipulate N-HiTS predictions by doubling the slope. These new slope attacks can bypass standard security mechanisms, such as a discriminator that filters real and perturbed inputs, reducing a 4-layered CNN's specificity to 28% and accuracy to 57%. Furthermore, the slope based methods were incorporated into a GAN architecture as a means of generating realistic synthetic data, while simultaneously fooling the model. Finally, this paper also proposes a sample malware designed to inject an adversarial attack in the model inference library, proving that ML-security research should not only focus on making the model safe, but also securing the entire pipeline.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, preprint; Total including Appendix: 21 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Staged Dynamics of Transformers in Learning Latent Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19328v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While transformers can discover latent structure from context, the dynamics of how they acquire different components of the latent structure remain poorly understood. In this work, we use the Alchemy benchmark, to investigate the dynamics of latent structure learning. We train a small decoder-only transformer on three task variants: 1) inferring missing rules from partial contextual information, 2) composing simple rules to solve multi-step sequences, and 3) decomposing complex multi-step examples to infer intermediate steps. By factorizing each task into interpretable events, we show that the model acquires capabilities in discrete stages, first learning the coarse grained rules, before learning the complete latent structure. We also identify a crucial asymmetry, where the model can compose fundamental rules robustly, but struggles to decompose complex examples to discover the fundamental rules. These findings offer new insights into understanding how a transformer model learns latent structures, providing a granular view of how these capabilities evolve during training.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Interpreting Graph Inference with Skyline Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07635v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNN outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively. Existing methods typically conform to individual pre-defined explainability measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-side'' interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that interprets GNN outputs by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3) We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Entropic Time Schedulers for Generative Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13612v4)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The practical performance of generative diffusion models depends on the appropriate choice of the noise scheduling function, which can also be equivalently expressed as a time reparameterization. In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.

| **[How does Alignment Enhance LLMs' Multilingual Capabilities? A Language Neurons Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21505v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multilingual Alignment is an effective and representative paradigm to enhance LLMs' multilingual capabilities, which transfers the capabilities from the high-resource languages to the low-resource languages. Meanwhile, some research on language-specific neurons provides a new perspective to analyze and understand LLMs' mechanisms. However, we find that there are many neurons that are shared by multiple but not all languages and cannot be correctly classified. In this work, we propose a ternary classification methodology that categorizes neurons into three types, including language-specific neurons, language-related neurons, and general neurons. And we propose a corresponding identification algorithm to distinguish these different types of neurons. Furthermore, based on the distributional characteristics of different types of neurons, we divide the LLMs' internal process for multilingual inference into four parts: (1) multilingual understanding, (2) shared semantic space reasoning, (3) multilingual output space transformation, and (4) vocabulary space outputting. Additionally, we systematically analyze the models before and after alignment with a focus on different types of neurons. We also analyze the phenomenon of ''Spontaneous Multilingual Alignment''. Overall, our work conducts a comprehensive investigation based on different types of neurons, providing empirical results and valuable insights to better understand multilingual alignment and multilingual capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 (Oral) |
| **[Dual-Granularity Semantic Prompting for Language Guidance Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19306v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared small target detection remains challenging due to limited feature representation and severe background interference, resulting in sub-optimal performance. While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

We introduce CDLM (Consistency Diffusion Language Models), a training-based acceleration method that simultaneously tackles both bottlenecks. CDLM integrates consistency modeling to drastically reduce the number of required sampling steps by enabling multi-token finalization. Furthermore, we enforce a block-wise causal attention mask during fine-tuning, making the model fully compatible with KV caching. Experiments show CDLM achieves 3.6x-14.5x lower latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on math and coding tasks.

| **[SimDiff: Simpler Yet Better Diffusion Model for Time Series Point Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19256v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on fixed heuristics or use Large Language Models (LLMs) directly in the control loop, which is costly and unsuitable for real-time systems. We propose MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment Shaping through Task and Reward Optimization), a framework that moves the LLM outside the execution loop and uses it as an offline training architect. MAESTRO introduces two generative components: (i) a semantic curriculum generator that creates diverse, performance-driven traffic scenarios, and (ii) an automated reward synthesizer that produces executable Python reward functions adapted to evolving curriculum difficulty. These components guide a standard MARL backbone (MADDPG) without increasing inference cost at deployment. We evaluate MAESTRO on large-scale traffic signal control (Hangzhou, 16 intersections) and conduct controlled ablations. Results show that combining LLM-generated curricula with LLM-generated reward shaping yields improved performance and stability. Across four seeds, the full system achieves +4.0% higher mean return (163.26 vs. 156.93) and 2.2% better risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe 1.53 vs. 0.70) over a strong curriculum baseline. These findings highlight LLMs as effective high-level designers for cooperative MARL training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint. 16 pages, 6 figures.

We present Audio Palette, a diffusion transformer (DiT) based model that extends the Stable Audio Open architecture to address this "control gap" in controllable audio generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on semantic conditioning, Audio Palette introduces four time-varying control signals: loudness, pitch, spectral centroid, and timbre, for precise and interpretable manipulation of acoustic features. The model is efficiently adapted for the nuanced domain of Foley synthesis using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a curated subset of AudioSet, requiring only 0.85 percent of the original parameters to be trained. Experiments demonstrate that Audio Palette achieves fine-grained, interpretable control of sound attributes. Crucially, it accomplishes this novel controllability while maintaining high audio quality and strong semantic alignment to text prompts, with performance on standard metrics such as Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and LAION-CLAP scores remaining comparable to the original baseline model. We provide a scalable, modular pipeline for audio research, emphasizing sequence-based conditioning, memory efficiency, and a three-scale classifier-free guidance mechanism for nuanced inference-time control. This work establishes a robust foundation for controllable sound design and performative audio synthesis in open-source settings, enabling a more artist-centric workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Artificial Intelligence Technology Research (AITR), Vol. 3, No. 2, December 2025</p></details> |

While recent studies suggest that adding metadata like URL information as context (i.e., auxiliary inputs not used in the loss calculation) can improve training efficiency and downstream performance, they offer limited understanding of which types of metadata are truly effective and under what conditions. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation and find that not all metadata types contribute equally. Only URL context speeds up training, whereas quality scores and topic/format domain information offer no clear benefit. Furthermore, the improved downstream performances of URL conditioning emerge only when longer prompts are used at inference time. In addition, we demonstrate that context-aware pretraining enables more controllable generation than context-free pretraining, in a classifier-free guidance fashion. Although topic and format metadata do not accelerate training, they are effective for steering outputs, offering human-interpretable control over generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, Camera Ready</p></details> |

The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |

While LoRA offers high parameter efficiency, its random initialization restricts gradient updates to a mismatched tangent space, causing significant information loss and hindering early convergence. Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K). On VTAB-1K, it achieves the highest accuracy among all methods, with strong gains on structured reasoning tasks requiring geometric understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, under review</p></details> |

In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 17 figures, 8 tables,</p></details> |
| **[Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10510v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we call for AI-oriented RTC research, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". We begin by recognizing the main differences between AI Video Chat and traditional RTC. Then, through prototype measurements, we identify that ultra-low bitrate is a key factor for low latency. To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat. DeViBench is open-sourced at: https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of the 24th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2025), College Park, Maryland, USA</p></details> |
| **[ModernBERT is More Efficient than Conventional BERT for Chest CT Findings Classification in Japanese Radiology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05060v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Japanese language models for medical text classification face challenges with complex vocabulary and linguistic structures in radiology reports. This study compared three Japanese models--BERT Base, JMedRoBERTa, and ModernBERT--for multi-label classification of 18 chest CT findings. Using the CT-RATE-JPN dataset, all models were fine-tuned under identical conditions. ModernBERT showed clear efficiency advantages, producing substantially fewer tokens and achieving faster training and inference than the other models while maintaining comparable performance on the internal test dataset (exact match accuracy: 74.7% vs. 72.7% for BERT Base). To assess generalizability, we additionally constructed RR-Findings, an external dataset of 243 naturally written Japanese radiology reports annotated using the same schema. Under this domain-shifted setting, performance differences became pronounced: BERT Base outperformed both JMedRoBERTa and ModernBERT, whereas ModernBERT showed the largest decline in exact match accuracy. Average precision differences were smaller, indicating that ModernBERT retained reasonable ranking ability despite reduced calibration. Overall, ModernBERT offers substantial computational efficiency and strong in-domain performance but remains sensitive to real-world linguistic variability. These results highlight the need for more diverse natural-language training data and domain-specific calibration strategies to improve robustness when deploying modern transformer models in heterogeneous clinical environments.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Inferring response times of perceptual decisions with Poisson variational autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11480v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Data on the Brain \& Mind</p></details> |
| **[ReEXplore: Improving MLLMs for Embodied Exploration with Contextualized Retrospective Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19033v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied exploration is a target-driven process that requires embodied agents to possess fine-grained perception and knowledge-enhanced decision making. While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions. Our approach enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration. Across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks, ReEXplore yields great improvements over strong MLLM baselines, up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and in navigation efficiency under open-source backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages plus 13 pages Appendix</p></details> |
| **[3D Dynamic Radio Map Prediction Using Vision Transformers for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19019v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWN) are rapidly expanding with the growing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for logistics, surveillance, and emergency response. Reliable connectivity remains a critical yet challenging task due to three-dimensional (3D) mobility, time-varying user density, and limited power budgets. The transmit power of base stations (BSs) fluctuates dynamically according to user locations and traffic demands, leading to a highly non-stationary 3D radio environment. Radio maps (RMs) have emerged as an effective means to characterize spatial power distributions and support radio-aware network optimization. However, most existing works construct static or offline RMs, overlooking real-time power variations and spatio-temporal dependencies in multi-UAV networks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a {3D dynamic radio map (3D-DRM)} framework that learns and predicts the spatio-temporal evolution of received power. Specially, a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder extracts high-dimensional spatial representations from 3D RMs, while a Transformer-based module models sequential dependencies to predict future power distributions. Experiments unveil that 3D-DRM accurately captures fast-varying power dynamics and substantially outperforms baseline models in both RM reconstruction and short-term prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |
| **[Classification EM-PCA for clustering and embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18992v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mixture model is undoubtedly one of the greatest contributions to clustering. For continuous data, Gaussian models are often used and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is particularly suitable for estimating parameters from which clustering is inferred. If these models are particularly popular in various domains including image clustering, they however suffer from the dimensionality and also from the slowness of convergence of the EM algorithm. However, the Classification EM (CEM) algorithm, a classifying version, offers a fast convergence solution while dimensionality reduction still remains a challenge. Thus we propose in this paper an algorithm combining simultaneously and non-sequentially the two tasks --Data embedding and Clustering-- relying on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and CEM. We demonstrate the interest of such approach in terms of clustering and data embedding. We also establish different connections with other clustering approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE conference on Big Data (Special Session on Machine Learning)</p></details> |
| **[Causally Reliable Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04363v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept-based models are an emerging paradigm in deep learning that constrains the inference process to operate through human-interpretable variables, facilitating explainability and human interaction. However, these architectures, on par with popular opaque neural models, fail to account for the true causal mechanisms underlying the target phenomena represented in the data. This hampers their ability to support causal reasoning tasks, limits out-of-distribution generalization, and hinders the implementation of fairness constraints. To overcome these issues, we propose Causally reliable Concept Bottleneck Models (C$^2$BMs), a class of concept-based architectures that enforce reasoning through a bottleneck of concepts structured according to a model of the real-world causal mechanisms. We also introduce a pipeline to automatically learn this structure from observational data and unstructured background knowledge (e.g., scientific literature). Experimental evidence suggests that C$^2$BMs are more interpretable, causally reliable, and improve responsiveness to interventions w.r.t. standard opaque and concept-based models, while maintaining their accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Q-SAM2: Accurate Quantization for Segment Anything Model 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09782v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) is a powerful foundation model for promptable segmentation. However, its high computational and memory costs are a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present Q-SAM2, an accurate low-bit quantization method that achieves high compression and high fidelity. To address performance degradation arising from challenging weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel contributions: Variance-Reduced Calibration (VRC), an initialization method that reduces weight statistical variance by minimizing the Frobenius norm over a small calibration batch; and Learnable Statistical Clipping (LSC), a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) method that learns momentum-stabilized clipping factors to manage outliers in weights and activations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference with substantial efficiency gains, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art general QAT schemes, particularly in the ultra-low 2-bit regime. Specifically, Q-SAM2 achieves an accuracy gain of up to 9.7 ppt in J&F on the video segmentation benchmark and 7.3 ppt in mIoU for instance segmentation over the best competing QAT model, all while achieving an 8x reduction in model size compared to the BF16 baseline.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[FastForward Pruning: Efficient LLM Pruning via Single-Step Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18977v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pruning is an effective method for compressing Large Language Models, but finding an optimal, non-uniform layer-wise sparsity allocation remains a key challenge. While heuristic methods are fast but yield suboptimal performance, more powerful search-based approaches like Reinforcement Learning are often hindered by prohibitive computational costs on large-scale models. To overcome this efficiency barrier, we propose FastForward Pruning. Its core is a decoupled, single-step RL framework that separates policy optimization from the complex budget satisfaction problem. Such a decoupling is crucial for efficiently searching the vast policy space of LLMs. This curriculum-based strategy begins with low-cost, simple tasks and gradually increases in complexity, significantly reducing the search's computational overhead. Evaluated on the LLaMA, Mistral, and OPT model families, our framework discovers pruning policies that achieve superior performance over strong heuristic baselines. Crucially, when compared to other search-based algorithms, our method achieves competitive or superior results at a fraction of the computational cost, demonstrating a clear advantage in search efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Classical methods treat these separately using heuristics, while Active Inference unifies them through Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization. However, EFE minimization is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. We build on recent theory recasting EFE minimization as variational inference, formally unifying it with Planning-as-Inference and showing the epistemic drive as a unique entropic contribution. Our main contribution is a novel message-passing scheme for this unified objective, enabling scalable Active Inference in factored-state MDPs and overcoming high-dimensional planning intractability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the EIML Workshop 2025 at EurIPS (non-archival)</p></details> |
| **[TRIM: Token Reduction and Inference Modeling for Cost-Effective Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07682v5)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses challenges, especially for tasks requiring lengthy outputs. However, natural language often contains redundancy, which presents an opportunity for optimization. We have observed that LLMs can generate distilled language (i.e., concise outputs that retain essential meaning) when prompted appropriately. We propose TRIM, a pipeline for saving computational cost in which the LLM omits a predefined set of semantically irrelevant and easily inferable words based on the context during inference. Then, a specifically trained smaller language model with lower inference cost reconstructs the distilled answer into the ideal answer. Our experiments show promising results, particularly on the proposed NaLDA evaluation dataset focused on the reconstruction task, with 19.4% saved tokens on average for GPT-4o and only a tiny decrease in evaluation metrics. This suggests that the approach can effectively balance efficiency and accuracy in language processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Exploits with Responsible AI Considerations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18933v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) remain susceptible to jailbreak exploits that bypass safety filters and induce harmful or unethical behavior. This work presents a systematic taxonomy of existing jailbreak defenses across prompt-level, model-level, and training-time interventions, followed by three proposed defense strategies. First, a Prompt-Level Defense Framework detects and neutralizes adversarial inputs through sanitization, paraphrasing, and adaptive system guarding. Second, a Logit-Based Steering Defense reinforces refusal behavior through inference-time vector steering in safety-sensitive layers. Third, a Domain-Specific Agent Defense employs the MetaGPT framework to enforce structured, role-based collaboration and domain adherence. Experiments on benchmark datasets show substantial reductions in attack success rate, achieving full mitigation under the agent-based defense. Overall, this study highlights how jailbreaks pose a significant security threat to LLMs and identifies key intervention points for prevention, while noting that defense strategies often involve trade-offs between safety, performance, and scalability.

| **[SlimCaching: Edge Caching of Mixture-of-Experts for Distributed Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06567v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input. However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we consider a scenario where experts are dispersed across an edge network for distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy, we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee. For the general case where $K \geq 1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE layer introduces non-submodularity, which renders greedy methods ineffective. To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference latency compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures.

While entropy minimization over the output distribution has proven effective for TTA, transformers offer an additional unsupervised learning signal through their attention mechanisms. We propose minimizing the entropy of attention distributions from the CLS token to image patches as a novel TTA objective.This approach encourages the model to attend more confidently to relevant image regions under distribution shift and is effective even when only a single test image is available. We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness across diverse corruption types while not hurting performance on clean data on a single sample stream of images at test time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initial submission. 5 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

However, the adoption of ML presents new challenges for the computing infrastructure, particularly in terms of provisioning and orchestrating access to hardware accelerators for development, testing, and production. The INFN-funded project AI_INFN ("Artificial Intelligence at INFN") aims at fostering the adoption of ML techniques within INFN use cases by providing support on multiple aspects, including the provision of AI-tailored computing resources. It leverages cloud-native solutions in the context of INFN Cloud, to share hardware accelerators as effectively as possible, ensuring the diversity of the Institute's research activities is not compromised. In this contribution, we provide an update on the commissioning of a Kubernetes platform designed to ease the development of GPU-powered data analysis workflows and their scalability on heterogeneous, distributed computing resources, possibly federated as Virtual Kubelets with the interLink provider.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review in EPJ Web of Conferences (CHEP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Quantum-machine-assisted Drug Discovery: Survey and Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13479v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug discovery and development is a highly complex and costly endeavor, typically requiring over a decade and substantial financial investment to bring a new drug to market. Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Method of Selective Attention for Reservoir Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21229v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training of deep reinforcement learning agents is slowed considerably by the presence of input dimensions that do not usefully condition the reward function. Existing modules such as layer normalization can be trained with weight decay to act as a form of selective attention, i.e. an input mask, that shrinks the scale of unnecessary inputs, which in turn accelerates training of the policy. However, we find a surprising result that adding numerous parameters to the computation of the input mask results in much faster training. A simple, high dimensional masking module is compared with layer normalization and a model without any input suppression. The high dimensional mask resulted in a four-fold speedup in training over the null hypothesis and a two-fold speedup in training over the layer normalization method.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Recurrent CircuitSAT Sampling for Sequential Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21226v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a novel GPU-accelerated circuit satisfiability (CircuitSAT) sampling technique for sequential circuits. This work is motivated by the requirement in constrained random verification (CRV) to generate input stimuli to validate the functionality of digital hardware circuits. A major challenge in CRV is generating inputs for sequential circuits, along with the appropriate number of clock cycles required to meet design constraints. Traditional approaches often use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) samplers to generate inputs by unrolling state transitions over a fixed number of clock cycles. However, these methods do not guarantee that a solution exists for the given number of cycles. Consequently, producing input stimuli together with the required clock cycles is essential for thorough testing and verification. Our approach converts the logical constraints and temporal behavior of sequential circuits into a recurrent CircuitSAT problem, optimized via gradient descent to efficiently explore a diverse set of valid solutions, including their associated number of clock cycles. By operating directly on the circuit structure, our method reinterprets the sampling process as a supervised multi-output regression task. This differentiable framework enables independent element-wise operations on each tensor element, facilitating parallel execution during learning. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with substantial runtime improvements (up to 105.1x) over state-of-the-art heuristic samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluations on circuit problems from the ISCAS-89 and ITC'99 benchmark suites.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Fast Training of Sinusoidal Neural Fields via Scaling Initialization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04779v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural fields are an emerging paradigm that represent data as continuous functions parameterized by neural networks. Despite many advantages, neural fields often have a high training cost, which prevents a broader adoption. In this paper, we focus on a popular family of neural fields, called sinusoidal neural fields (SNFs), and study how it should be initialized to maximize the training speed. We find that the standard initialization scheme for SNFs -- designed based on the signal propagation principle -- is suboptimal. In particular, we show that by simply multiplying each weight (except for the last layer) by a constant, we can accelerate SNF training by 10$\times$. This method, coined $\textit{weight scaling}$, consistently provides a significant speedup over various data domains, allowing the SNFs to train faster than more recently proposed architectures. To understand why the weight scaling works well, we conduct extensive theoretical and empirical analyses which reveal that the weight scaling not only resolves the spectral bias quite effectively but also enjoys a well-conditioned optimization trajectory.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Fast 3D point clouds retrieval for Large-scale 3D Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21067v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval in 3D point clouds is a challenging task that consists in retrieving the most similar point clouds to a given query within a reference of 3D points. Current methods focus on comparing descriptors of point clouds in order to identify similar ones. Due to the complexity of this latter step, here we focus on the acceleration of the retrieval by adapting the Differentiable Search Index (DSI), a transformer-based approach initially designed for text information retrieval, for 3D point clouds retrieval. Our approach generates 1D identifiers based on the point descriptors, enabling direct retrieval in constant time. To adapt DSI to 3D data, we integrate Vision Transformers to map descriptors to these identifiers while incorporating positional and semantic encoding. The approach is evaluated for place recognition on a public benchmark comparing its retrieval capabilities against state-of-the-art methods, in terms of quality and speed of returned point clouds.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figures |
| **[Solving the enigma: Enhancing faithfulness and comprehensibility in explanations of deep networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10008v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accelerated progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has popularized deep learning models across various domains, yet their inherent opacity poses challenges, particularly in critical fields like healthcare, medicine, and the geosciences. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged to shed light on these 'black box' models, aiding in deciphering their decision-making processes. However, different XAI methods often produce significantly different explanations, leading to high inter-method variability that increases uncertainty and undermines trust in deep networks' predictions. In this study, we address this challenge by introducing a novel framework designed to enhance the explainability of deep networks through a dual focus on maximizing both accuracy and comprehensibility in the explanations. Our framework integrates outputs from multiple established XAI methods and leverages a non-linear neural network model, termed the 'explanation optimizer,' to construct a unified, optimal explanation. The optimizer evaluates explanations using two key metrics: faithfulness (accuracy in reflecting the network's decisions) and complexity (comprehensibility). By balancing these, it provides accurate and accessible explanations, addressing a key XAI limitation. Experiments on multi-class and binary classification in 2D object and 3D neuroscience imaging confirm its efficacy. Our optimizer achieved faithfulness scores 155% and 63% higher than the best XAI methods in 3D and 2D tasks, respectively, while also reducing complexity for better understanding. These results demonstrate that optimal explanations based on specific quality criteria are achievable, offering a solution to the issue of inter-method variability in the current XAI literature and supporting more trustworthy deep network predictions</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted manuscript in AI Open Journal (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/ai-open)</p></details> |
| **[The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21037v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text pp. 1-5; Supplementary Material pp. 6-10</p></details> |
| **[SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08545v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse models. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[A RISC-V Multicore and GPU SoC Platform with a Qualifiable Software Stack for Safety Critical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21027v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of the Horizon Europe project, METASAT, a hardware platform was developed as a prototype of future space systems. The platform is based on a multiprocessor NOEL-V, an established space-grade processor, which is integrated with the SPARROW AI accelerator and connected to a GPU, Vortex. Both processing systems follow the RISC-V specification. This is a novel hardware architecture for the space domain as the use of massive parallel processing units, such as GPUs, is starting to be considered for upcoming space missions due to the increased performance required to future space-related workloads, in particular, related to AI. However, such solutions are only currently adopted for New Space, since their limitations come not only from the hardware, but also from the software, which needs to be qualified before being deployed on an institutional mission. For this reason, the METASAT platform is one of the first endeavors towards enabling the use of high performance hardware in a qualifiable environment for safety critical systems. The software stack is based on baremetal, RTEMS and the XtratuM hypervisor, providing different options for applications of various degrees of criticality.</p></details> | <details><summary>OSSMP...</summary><p>OSSMPIC2025, 1st workshop on Open Source Solutions for Massively Parallel Integrated Circuits</p></details> |
| **[All-rounder: A Flexible AI Accelerator with Diverse Data Format Support and Morphable Structure for Multi-DNN Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16757v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the explosive increase in the use of AI-based applications, several industrial companies developed custom ASICs (e.g., Google TPU, IBM RaPiD, Intel NNP-I/NNP-T) and constructed a hyperscale cloud infrastructure with them. These ASICs perform operations of the inference or training process of AI models which are requested by users. Since the AI models have different data formats and types of operations, the ASICs need to support diverse data formats and various operation shapes. However, the previous ASIC solutions do not or less fulfill these requirements. To overcome these limitations, we first present an area-efficient multiplier, named all-in-one multiplier, that supports multiple bit-widths for both integer and floating point data types. Then, we build a MAC array equipped with these multipliers with multi-format support. In addition, the MAC array can be partitioned into multiple blocks that can be flexibly fused to support various DNN operation types. We evaluate the practical effectiveness of the proposed MAC array by making an accelerator out of it, named All-rounder. According to our evaluation, the proposed all-in-one multiplier occupies 1.49x smaller area compared to the baselines with dedicated multipliers for each data format. Then, we compare the performance and energy efficiency of the proposed All-rounder with three different accelerators showing consistent speedup and higher efficiency across various AI benchmarks from vision to LLM-based language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pap...</summary><p>A paper accepted in the 2025 IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems</p></details> |
| **[Understanding intra-node communication in HPC systems and Datacenters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20965v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, specialized computing and storage devices, such as GPUs, TPUs, and high-speed storage, have been increasingly integrated into server nodes within Supercomputers and Data Centers. The advent of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) has facilitated a more compact design for these components, enabling multiple units to be interconnected within a single server node through intra-node networks like PCIe, NVLink, or Ethernet. These networks allow for scaling up the number of dedicated computing and storage devices per node. Additionally, inter-node networks link these devices across thousands of server nodes in large-scale computing systems. However, as communication demands among accelerators grow-especially in workloads like generative AI-both intra- and inter-node networks risk becoming critical bottlenecks. Although modern intra-node network architectures attempt to mitigate this issue by boosting bandwidth, we demonstrate in this paper that such an approach can inadvertently degrade inter-node communication. This occurs when high-bandwidth intra-node traffic interferes with incoming traffic from external nodes, leading to congestion. To evaluate this phenomenon, we analyze the communication behavior of realistic traffic patterns commonly found in generative AI applications. Using OMNeT++, we developed a general simulation model that captures both intra- and inter-node network interactions. Through extensive simulations, our findings reveal that increasing intra-node bandwidth and the number of accelerators per node can actually hinder overall inter-node communication performance rather than improve it.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Guiding Quantitative MRI Reconstruction with Phase-wise Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20877v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) requires multi-phase acqui-sition, often relying on reduced data sampling and reconstruction algorithms to accelerate scans, which inherently poses an ill-posed inverse problem. While many studies focus on measuring uncertainty during this process, few explore how to leverage it to enhance reconstruction performance. In this paper, we in-troduce PUQ, a novel approach that pioneers the use of uncertainty infor-mation for qMRI reconstruction. PUQ employs a two-stage reconstruction and parameter fitting framework, where phase-wise uncertainty is estimated during reconstruction and utilized in the fitting stage. This design allows uncertainty to reflect the reliability of different phases and guide information integration during parameter fitting. We evaluated PUQ on in vivo T1 and T2 mapping datasets from healthy subjects. Compared to existing qMRI reconstruction methods, PUQ achieved the state-of-the-art performance in parameter map-pings, demonstrating the effectiveness of uncertainty guidance. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PUQ-75B2/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Preconditioned Score-based Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06504v4)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models. However, a fundamental limitation is that their sampling process is slow due to a need for many (e.g., 2000) iterations of sequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the sampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We assault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and reverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a novel preconditioned diffusion sampling (PDS) method that leverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS alters the sampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation cost and without model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves the output distribution of the SGM, with no risk of inducing systematical bias to the original sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation between the parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations, easing the parameter estimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various image datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our PDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the synthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to 28x on more challenging high-resolution (1024x1024) image generation. Compared with the latest generative models (e.g., CLD-SGM and Analytic-DDIM), PDS can achieve the best sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at an FID score of 1.99. Our code is publicly available to foster any further research https://github.com/fudan-zvg/PDS.</p></details> | IJCV 2025 |
| **[Towards Practical Real-Time Neural Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20762v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a practical real-time neural video codec (NVC) designed to deliver high compression ratio, low latency and broad versatility. In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

| **[Deep RC: A Scalable Data Engineering and Deep Learning Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20724v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant obstacles exist in scientific domains including genetics, climate modeling, and astronomy due to the management, preprocess, and training on complicated data for deep learning. Even while several large-scale solutions offer distributed execution environments, open-source alternatives that integrate scalable runtime tools, deep learning and data frameworks on high-performance computing platforms remain crucial for accessibility and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce Deep Radical-Cylon(RC), a heterogeneous runtime system that combines data engineering, deep learning frameworks, and workflow engines across several HPC environments, including cloud and supercomputing infrastructures. Deep RC supports heterogeneous systems with accelerators, allows the usage of communication libraries like MPI, GLOO and NCCL across multi-node setups, and facilitates parallel and distributed deep learning pipelines by utilizing Radical Pilot as a task execution framework. By attaining an end-to-end pipeline including preprocessing, model training, and postprocessing with 11 neural forecasting models (PyTorch) and hydrology models (TensorFlow) under identical resource conditions, the system reduces 3.28 and 75.9 seconds, respectively. The design of Deep RC guarantees the smooth integration of scalable data frameworks, such as Cylon, with deep learning processes, exhibiting strong performance on cloud platforms and scientific HPC systems. By offering a flexible, high-performance solution for resource-intensive applications, this method closes the gap between data preprocessing, model training, and postprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Map Space Belief Prediction for Manipulation-Enhanced Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20606v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching for objects in cluttered environments requires selecting efficient viewpoints and manipulation actions to remove occlusions and reduce uncertainty in object locations, shapes, and categories. In this work, we address the problem of manipulation-enhanced semantic mapping, where a robot has to efficiently identify all objects in a cluttered shelf. Although Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes~(POMDPs) are standard for decision-making under uncertainty, representing unstructured interactive worlds remains challenging in this formalism. To tackle this, we define a POMDP whose belief is summarized by a metric-semantic grid map and propose a novel framework that uses neural networks to perform map-space belief updates to reason efficiently and simultaneously about object geometries, locations, categories, occlusions, and manipulation physics. Further, to enable accurate information gain analysis, the learned belief updates should maintain calibrated estimates of uncertainty. Therefore, we propose Calibrated Neural-Accelerated Belief Updates (CNABUs) to learn a belief propagation model that generalizes to novel scenarios and provides confidence-calibrated predictions for unknown areas. Our experiments show that our novel POMDP planner improves map completeness and accuracy over existing methods in challenging simulations and successfully transfers to real-world cluttered shelves in zero-shot fashion.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Training LLMs with MXFP4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20586v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low precision (LP) datatypes such as MXFP4 can accelerate matrix multiplications (GEMMs) and reduce training costs. However, directly using MXFP4 instead of BF16 during training significantly degrades model quality. In this work, we present the first near-lossless training recipe that uses MXFP4 GEMMs, which are $2\times$ faster than FP8 on supported hardware. Our key insight is to compute unbiased gradient estimates with stochastic rounding (SR), resulting in more accurate model updates. However, directly applying SR to MXFP4 can result in high variance from block-level outliers, harming convergence. To overcome this, we use the random Hadamard tranform to theoretically bound the variance of SR. We train GPT models up to 6.7B parameters and find that our method induces minimal degradation over mixed-precision BF16 training. Our recipe computes $>1/2$ the training FLOPs in MXFP4, enabling an estimated speedup of $>1.3\times$ over FP8 and $>1.7\times$ over BF16 during backpropagation.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[WWW: What, When, Where to Compute-in-Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15896v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix multiplication is the dominant computation during Machine Learning (ML) inference. To efficiently perform such multiplication operations, Compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigms have emerged as a highly energy efficient solution. However, integrating compute in memory poses key questions, such as 1) What type of CiM to use: Given a multitude of CiM design characteristics, determining their suitability from architecture perspective is needed. 2) When to use CiM: ML inference includes workloads with a variety of memory and compute requirements, making it difficult to identify when CiM is more beneficial than standard processing cores. 3) Where to integrate CiM: Each memory level has different bandwidth and capacity, creating different data reuse opportunities for CiM integration. To answer such questions regarding on-chip CiM integration for accelerating ML workloads, we use an analytical architecture-evaluation methodology with tailored mapping algorithm. The mapping algorithm aims to achieve highest weight reuse and reduced data movements for a given CiM prototype and workload. Our analysis considers the integration of CiM prototypes into the cache levels of a tensor-core-like architecture, and shows that CiM integrated memory improves energy efficiency by up to 3.4x and throughput by up to 15.6x compared to established baseline with INT-8 precision. We believe the proposed work provides insights into what type of CiM to use, and when and where to optimally integrate it in the cache hierarchy for efficient matrix multiplication.</p></details> | added supplementary |

| **[Accelerating Training with Neuron Interaction and Nowcasting Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04434v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network training can be accelerated when a learnable update rule is used in lieu of classic adaptive optimizers (e.g. Adam). However, learnable update rules can be costly and unstable to train and use. Recently, Jang et al. (2023) proposed a simpler approach to accelerate training based on weight nowcaster networks (WNNs). In their approach, Adam is used for most of the optimization steps and periodically, only every few steps, a WNN nowcasts (predicts near future) parameters. We improve WNNs by proposing neuron interaction and nowcasting (NiNo) networks. In contrast to WNNs, NiNo leverages neuron connectivity and graph neural networks to more accurately nowcast parameters. We further show that in some networks, such as Transformers, modeling neuron connectivity accurately is challenging. We address this and other limitations, which allows NiNo to accelerate Adam training by up to 50% in vision and language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, code is https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/nino</p></details> |
| **[Speculative RAG: Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation through Drafting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08223v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combines the generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In these applications, video cameras and sensors offload inference tasks like license plate recognition and vehicle tracking to remote servers due to local computing and energy constraints. However, legacy network solutions, designed primarily for human-centric applications, struggle to reliably support these MCAs, which demand heterogeneous and fluctuating QoS (due to diverse application inference tasks), further challenged by dynamic wireless network conditions and limited spectrum resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design (ACCORD) framework. This innovative framework anticipates the evolving demands of MCAs in real time, quickly adapting to provide customized QoS and optimal performance, even for the most dynamic and unpredictable MCAs. This also leads to improved network resource management and spectrum utilization. ACCORD operates as a closed feedback-loop system between the application client and network and consists of two key components: (1) Building Application Context: It focuses on understanding the specific context of MCA requirements. Contextual factors include device capabilities, user behavior (e.g., mobility speed), and network channel conditions.

In this paper, we leverage the self-attention features from pretrained diffusion networks to transfer the visual characteristics from a reference to generated images. Unlike previous work that uses these features as plug-and-play attributes, we propose a novel attention distillation loss calculated between the ideal and current stylization results, based on which we optimize the synthesized image via backpropagation in latent space. Next, we propose an improved Classifier Guidance that integrates attention distillation loss into the denoising sampling process, further accelerating the synthesis and enabling a broad range of image generation applications. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the extraordinary performance of our approach in transferring the examples' style, appearance, and texture to new images in synthesis.

However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community.

In this context, the Ising model implemented by the probabilistic computing systems with probabilistic bits (p-bits) has attracted attention due to the widespread availability of p-bits and support for large-scale simulations. This study marks the first work to apply probabilistic computing to tackle protein folding, a significant NP-complete problem challenge in biology. We represent proteins as sequences of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) beads within a three-dimensional (3-D) grid and introduce a novel many-body interaction-based encoding method to map the problem onto an Ising model. Our simulations show that this approach significantly simplifies the energy landscape for short peptide sequences of six amino acids, halving the number of energy levels. Furthermore, the proposed mapping method achieves approximately 100 times acceleration for sequences consisting of ten amino acids in identifying the correct folding configuration. We predicted the optimal folding configuration for a peptide sequence of 36 amino acids by identifying the ground state. These findings highlight the unique potential of the proposed encoding method for solving protein folding and, importantly, provide new tools for solving similar NP-complete problems in biology by probabilistic computing approach.</p></details> | 14pages, 6 fingures |

We introduce an efficient and accurate method for mapping complex moving geometries onto uniform Cartesian grids suitable for massively parallel processing. A validation of the physical accuracy of the solid-fluid coupling and the proposed mapping of complex geometries ispresented. The implementation is integrated into the code generation pipeline of the waLBerla framework so that highly optimized kernels for CPU and GPU architectures become available. We study the node-level performance of the automatically generated solver routines. 71% of the peak performance can be achieved on CPU nodes and 86% on GPU accelerated nodes. Only a moderate overhead is observed for the processing of the solid-fluid coupling when compared to the fluids simulations without moving objects. Finally, a counter-rotating rotor is presented as a prototype industrial scenario, resulting in a mesh size involving up to 4.3 billion fluid grid cells. For this scenario, excellent parallel efficiency is reported in a strong scaling study on up to 32,768 CPU cores on the LUMI-C supercomputer and on up to 1,024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on the JUWELS Booster system.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |

Our system adopts a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques for feature detection and matching with traditional backend optimization methods. Specifically, we propose a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously extracts keypoints and structural lines. These features are then associated, matched, triangulated, and optimized in a coupled manner. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight relocalization pipeline that reuses the built map, where keypoints, lines, and a structure graph are used to match the query frame with the map. To enhance the applicability of the proposed system to real-world robots, we deploy and accelerate the feature detection and matching networks using C++ and NVIDIA TensorRT. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art visual SLAM systems in illumination-challenging environments. Efficiency evaluations show that our system can run at a rate of 73Hz on a PC and 40Hz on an embedded platform.

ProtoOcc consists of two main components: the Dual Branch Encoder (DBE) and the Prototype Query Decoder (PQD). The DBE produces a new 3D voxel representation by combining 3D voxel and BEV representations across multiple scales through a dual branch structure. This design enhances both performance and computational efficiency by providing a large receptive field for the BEV representation while maintaining a smaller receptive field for the voxel representation. The PQD introduces Prototype Queries to accelerate the decoding process. Scene-Adaptive Prototypes are derived from the 3D voxel features of input sample, while Scene-Agnostic Prototypes are computed by applying Scene-Adaptive Prototypes to an Exponential Moving Average during the training phase. By using these prototype-based queries for decoding, we can directly predict 3D occupancy in a single step, eliminating the need for iterative Transformer decoding. Additionally, we propose the Robust Prototype Learning, which injects noise into prototype generation process and trains the model to denoise during the training phase. ProtoOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with 45.02% mIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark. For single-frame method, it reaches 39.56% mIoU with an inference speed of 12.83 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 3090.

As the idiom "A picture is worth a thousand words" implies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds or even thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs, which grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely impacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within the early layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the loss of crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. To address this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visual tokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy progressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, we propose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost their efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance loss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part of the image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creating pyramid-like visual tokens across model layers. The dropping is based on a lightweight similarity calculation with a negligible time overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PyramidDrop can achieve a 40% training time and 55% inference FLOPs acceleration of LLaVA-NeXT with comparable performance. Besides, the PyramidDrop could also serve as a plug-and-play strategy for inference acceleration without training, with better performance and lower inference cost than counterparts.

One class for such accelerators are so-called processor arrays, which typically integrate a two-dimensional mesh of interconnected processing elements (PEs). Such arrays are specifically designed to accelerate the execution of multidimensional nested loops by exploiting the intrinsic parallelism of such loops. Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) belong to this class of accelerator architectures. In this work, we analyze four toolchains for mapping loop programs onto CGRAs and compare the resulting mappings wrt. performance, i.e., latency. While most toolchains succeed in simpler kernels like general matrix multiplication, some struggle to find valid mappings for more complex loops like a triangular solver. Furthermore, we observe that the considered CGRA mappers generally tend to underutilize the available PEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>OSSMP...</summary><p>OSSMPIC2025, 1st workshop on Open Source Solutions for Massively Parallel Integrated Circuits. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2502.12062</p></details> |

CoT-ICL Lab allows fine grained control over the complexity of in-context examples by decoupling (1) the causal structure involved in chain token generation from (2) the underlying token processing functions. We train decoder-only transformers (up to 700M parameters) on these datasets and show that CoT accelerates the accuracy transition to higher values across model sizes. In particular, we find that model depth is crucial for leveraging CoT with limited in-context examples, while more examples help shallow models match deeper model performance. Additionally, limiting the diversity of token processing functions throughout training improves causal structure learning via ICL. We also interpret these transitions by analyzing transformer embeddings and attention maps. Overall, CoT-ICL Lab serves as a simple yet powerful testbed for theoretical and empirical insights into ICL and CoT in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 27 figures, 3 tables, code at https://github.com/kvignesh1420/cot-icl-lab</p></details> |

An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels. In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\times$ and 11.1$\times$ speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Parallel Tree Search for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16235v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

In a recent class of neural network, Lagrangian mechanics is hard-coded into the architecture, and training the network learns the given system. However, the current architectures do not facilitate the modelling of dynamical systems that are driven by servomechanisms (e.g. servomotors, stepper motors, current sources, volumetric pumps). This article presents ServoLNN, a new architecture to model dynamical systems that are driven by servomechanisms. ServoLNN is compatible for use in real-time applications, where the driving motion is known only just-in-time. A PyTorch implementation of ServoLNN is provided. The derivations and results reveal the occurrence of a possible family of solutions that the training may converge on. The effect of the family of solutions on the predicted physical quantities is explored, as is the resolution to reduce the family of solutions to a single solution. Resultantly, the architecture can simultaneously accurately find the energies, power, rate of work, mass matrix, generalised accelerations, generalised forces, and the generalised forces that drive the servomechanisms.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, we propose a new stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated momentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration, followed by a momentum update based on these extrapolations. We demonstrate that the proposed SFOM can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order smoothness of the objective function $f$. Assuming that the $p$th-order derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous for some $p\ge2$, and under additional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a point $x$ such that $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x)\|]\le\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary-order smoothness of the objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that improves upon the best-known results without assuming the mean-squared smoothness condition. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical performance of our method and support our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some claims about the contributions were overstated, and we are currently working on the revision</p></details> |

In contrast, encoders like BERT and RoBERTa have not seen the same level of progress despite being foundational for many downstream NLP applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce NeoBERT, a next-generation encoder that redefines the capabilities of bidirectional models by integrating state-of-the-art advancements in architecture, modern data, and optimized pre-training methodologies. NeoBERT is designed for seamless adoption: it serves as a plug-and-play replacement for existing base models, relies on an optimal depth-to-width ratio, and leverages an extended context length of 4,096 tokens. Despite its compact 250M parameter footprint, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the massive MTEB benchmark, outperforming BERT large, RoBERTa large, NomicBERT, and ModernBERT under identical fine-tuning conditions. In addition, we rigorously evaluate the impact of each modification on GLUE and design a uniform fine-tuning and evaluation framework for MTEB. We release all code, data, checkpoints, and training scripts to accelerate research and real-world adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables.

Evaluating Algorithmic Reasoning with Counterexample Creation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19414v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing excitement about the potential of Language Models (LMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. Falsifying hypotheses is key to scientific progress, as it allows claims to be iteratively refined over time. This process requires significant researcher effort, reasoning, and ingenuity. Yet current benchmarks for LMs predominantly assess their ability to generate solutions rather than challenge them. We advocate for developing benchmarks that evaluate this inverse capability - creating counterexamples for subtly incorrect solutions. To demonstrate this approach, we start with the domain of algorithmic problem solving, where counterexamples can be evaluated automatically using code execution. Specifically, we introduce REFUTE, a dynamically updating benchmark that includes recent problems and incorrect submissions from programming competitions, where human experts successfully identified counterexamples. Our analysis finds that the best reasoning agents, even OpenAI o3-mini (high) with code execution feedback, can create counterexamples for only <9% of incorrect solutions in REFUTE, even though ratings indicate its ability to solve up to 48% of these problems from scratch. We hope our work spurs progress in evaluating and enhancing LMs' ability to falsify incorrect solutions - a capability that is crucial for both accelerating research and making models self-improve through reliable reflective reasoning.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10733v6)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

Conventional preliminary damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches. These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected communities.</p></details> | 28 Pages, 12 Figures |
| **[Simplifying Causal Mediation Analysis for Time-to-Event Outcomes using Pseudo-Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17533v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mediation analysis for survival outcomes is challenging. Most existing methods quantify the treatment effect using the hazard ratio (HR) and attempt to decompose the HR into the direct effect of treatment plus an indirect, or mediated, effect. However, the HR is not expressible as an expectation, which complicates this decomposition, both in terms of estimation and interpretation. Here, we present an alternative approach which leverages pseudo-values to simplify estimation and inference. Pseudo-values take censoring into account during their construction, and once derived, can be modeled in the same way as any continuous outcome. Thus, pseudo-values enable mediation analysis for a survival outcome to fit seamlessly into standard mediation software (e.g. CMAverse in R). Pseudo-values are easy to calculate via a leave-one-observation-out procedure (i.e. jackknifing) and the calculation can be accelerated when the influence function of the estimator is known. Mediation analysis for causal effects defined by survival probabilities, restricted mean survival time, and cumulative incidence functions - in the presence of competing risks - can all be performed within this framework. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the method is unbiased across 324 scenarios/estimands and controls the type-I error at the nominal level under the null of no mediation. We illustrate the approach using data from the PARADIGMS clinical trial for the treatment of pediatric multiple sclerosis using fingolimod. In particular, we evaluate whether an imaging biomarker lies on the causal path between treatment and time-to-relapse, which aids in justifying this biomarker as a surrogate outcome. Our approach greatly simplifies mediation analysis for survival data and provides a decomposition of the total effect that is both intuitive and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Media...</summary><p>Mediation, Pseudo-Values, Time-to-event, Survival Analysis, Restricted Mean Survival Time, Competing Risks</p></details> |

A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's ability to cover the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose a theoretical transfer learning algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop an empirical algorithm with improved computational efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically in summarization tasks.</p></details> | 35 Pages |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Formal methods are recommended by functional safety standards (e.g., by IEC 61511 for the process industry and by the generic IEC 61508) and play a crucial role. Their structured approach reduces ambiguity in system requirements, facilitating early error detection. This paper introduces a formal verification service for PLC (programmable logic controller) programs compliant with functional safety standards, providing external expertise to organizations while eliminating the need for extensive internal training.

| **[Efficient and Accurate Spatial Mixing of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Materials Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19081v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Learning Harmonized Representations for Speculative Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15766v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative sampling is a promising approach to accelerate the decoding stage for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.

| **[Faster Diffusion via Temporal Attention Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02747v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR: https://openreview.net/forum?id=xXs2GKXPnH</p></details> |

The paper presents a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of this paradigm by the means of a systematic mapping study and a scoping review of relevant literature. According to the mapping and review, the paradigm has been extensively discussed, used, and developed further since the late 1990s. Partially driven by the insecurity of the Internet of things, the volume of publications has accelerated from the circa mid-2010s onward. The publications reviewed indicate that the paradigm has been adopted in numerous different contexts. It has also been expanded with security design principles not originally considered when the paradigm was initiated in the mid-1970s. Among the newer principles are an "off by default" principle, various overriding and fallback principles, as well as those related to the zero trust model. The review also indicates problems developers and others have faced with the paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Information Security and Applications, 2025, vol. 90, pp. 103989</p></details> |

Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 1.1B and datasets of OpenWebText and MiniPile. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Departing from conventional methodologies that rely on aggregating computationally intensive 4D costs, LightStereo adopts the 3D cost volume as a lightweight alternative. While similar approaches have been explored previously, our breakthrough lies in enhancing performance through a dedicated focus on the channel dimension of the 3D cost volume, where the distribution of matching costs is encapsulated. Our exhaustive exploration has yielded plenty of strategies to amplify the capacity of the pivotal dimension, ensuring both precision and efficiency. We compare the proposed LightStereo with existing state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, which demonstrate its superior performance in speed, accuracy, and resource utilization. LightStereo achieves a competitive EPE metric in the SceneFlow datasets while demanding a minimum of only 22 GFLOPs and 17 ms of runtime, and ranks 1st on KITTI 2015 among real-time models.

To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution.

Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

| **[Efficient Inference for Large Language Model-based Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05165v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding. For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5x speedup under relaxed sampling verification. The codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/Linxyhaha/AtSpeed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This work investigates the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to solve a collection of contact-rich manipulation tasks on a humanoid embodiment. We introduce novel techniques to overcome the identified challenges with empirical validation. Our main contributions include an automated real-to-sim tuning module that brings the simulated environment closer to the real world, a generalized reward design scheme that simplifies reward engineering for long-horizon contact-rich manipulation tasks, a divide-and-conquer distillation process that improves the sample efficiency of hard-exploration problems while maintaining sim-to-real performance, and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations to bridge the sim-to-real perception gap. We show promising results on three humanoid dexterous manipulation tasks, with ablation studies on each technique. Our work presents a successful approach to learning humanoid dexterous manipulation using sim-to-real reinforcement learning, achieving robust generalization and high performance without the need for human demonstration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/recipe/</p></details> |
| **[Walking the Web of Concept-Class Relationships in Incrementally Trained Interpretable Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20393v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept-based methods have emerged as a promising direction to develop interpretable neural networks in standard supervised settings. However, most works that study them in incremental settings assume either a static concept set across all experiences or assume that each experience relies on a distinct set of concepts. In this work, we study concept-based models in a more realistic, dynamic setting where new classes may rely on older concepts in addition to introducing new concepts themselves. We show that concepts and classes form a complex web of relationships, which is susceptible to degradation and needs to be preserved and augmented across experiences. We introduce new metrics to show that existing concept-based models cannot preserve these relationships even when trained using methods to prevent catastrophic forgetting, since they cannot handle forgetting at concept, class, and concept-class relationship levels simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a novel method - MuCIL - that uses multimodal concepts to perform classification without increasing the number of trainable parameters across experiences. The multimodal concepts are aligned to concepts provided in natural language, making them interpretable by design. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art classification performance compared to other concept-based models, achieving over 2$\times$ the classification performance in some cases. We also study the ability of our model to perform interventions on concepts, and show that it can localize visual concepts in input images, providing post-hoc interpretations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main text, 6 figures in main text, 11 pages of Appendix, published in AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[InterMimic: Towards Universal Whole-Body Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20390v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving realistic simulations of humans interacting with a wide range of objects has long been a fundamental goal. Extending physics-based motion imitation to complex human-object interactions (HOIs) is challenging due to intricate human-object coupling, variability in object geometries, and artifacts in motion capture data, such as inaccurate contacts and limited hand detail. We introduce InterMimic, a framework that enables a single policy to robustly learn from hours of imperfect MoCap data covering diverse full-body interactions with dynamic and varied objects. Our key insight is to employ a curriculum strategy -- perfect first, then scale up. We first train subject-specific teacher policies to mimic, retarget, and refine motion capture data. Next, we distill these teachers into a student policy, with the teachers acting as online experts providing direct supervision, as well as high-quality references. Notably, we incorporate RL fine-tuning on the student policy to surpass mere demonstration replication and achieve higher-quality solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that InterMimic produces realistic and diverse interactions across multiple HOI datasets. The learned policy generalizes in a zero-shot manner and seamlessly integrates with kinematic generators, elevating the framework from mere imitation to generative modeling of complex human-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Beyond Next-Token: Next-X Prediction for Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20388v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) modeling, known for its next-token prediction paradigm, underpins state-of-the-art language and visual generative models. Traditionally, a ``token'' is treated as the smallest prediction unit, often a discrete symbol in language or a quantized patch in vision. However, the optimal token definition for 2D image structures remains an open question. Moreover, AR models suffer from exposure bias, where teacher forcing during training leads to error accumulation at inference. In this paper, we propose xAR, a generalized AR framework that extends the notion of a token to an entity X, which can represent an individual patch token, a cell (a $k\times k$ grouping of neighboring patches), a subsample (a non-local grouping of distant patches), a scale (coarse-to-fine resolution), or even a whole image. Additionally, we reformulate discrete token classification as \textbf{continuous entity regression}, leveraging flow-matching methods at each AR step. This approach conditions training on noisy entities instead of ground truth tokens, leading to Noisy Context Learning, which effectively alleviates exposure bias. As a result, xAR offers two key advantages: (1) it enables flexible prediction units that capture different contextual granularity and spatial structures, and (2) it mitigates exposure bias by avoiding reliance on teacher forcing. On ImageNet-256 generation benchmark, our base model, xAR-B (172M), outperforms DiT-XL/SiT-XL (675M) while achieving 20$\times$ faster inference. Meanwhile, xAR-H sets a new state-of-the-art with an FID of 1.24, running 2.2$\times$ faster than the previous best-performing model without relying on vision foundation modules (\eg, DINOv2) or advanced guidance interval sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at \url{https://oliverrensu.github.io/project/xAR}</p></details> |

As preparation, we first propose an Identity-Free Pre-training strategy that enables the pre-training of the person-specific model and encourages the collection of universal motion priors from long-video data corpus. To fully exploit the universal motion priors to learn an unseen new identity, we then present a Motion-Aligned Adaptation strategy to adaptively align the target head to the pre-trained field, and constrain a robust dynamic head structure under few training data.

| **[Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> |

Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Monocular Dynamic Scene Rendering via Sparse Time-Variant Attribute Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20378v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rendering dynamic scenes from monocular videos is a crucial yet challenging task. The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution to represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time steps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of Gaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model every Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the primary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of Gaussians. In response, we introduce Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS), which represents dynamic scenes via sparse time-variant attribute modeling. Our approach formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid representation, with the motion flow of dense Gaussians calculated via a classical kernel representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised strategy to efficiently filter out anchors corresponding to static areas. Only anchors associated with deformable objects are input into MLPs to query time-variant attributes. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our EDGS significantly improves the rendering speed with superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Tight Inversion: Image-Conditioned Inversion for Real Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20376v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models offer powerful image editing capabilities. To edit real images, many methods rely on the inversion of the image into Gaussian noise. A common approach to invert an image is to gradually add noise to the image, where the noise is determined by reversing the sampling equation. This process has an inherent tradeoff between reconstruction and editability, limiting the editing of challenging images such as highly-detailed ones. Recognizing the reliance of text-to-image models inversion on a text condition, this work explores the importance of the condition choice. We show that a condition that precisely aligns with the input image significantly improves the inversion quality. Based on our findings, we introduce Tight Inversion, an inversion method that utilizes the most possible precise condition -- the input image itself. This tight condition narrows the distribution of the model's output and enhances both reconstruction and editability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when combined with existing inversion methods through extensive experiments, evaluating the reconstruction accuracy as well as the integration with various editing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://tight-inversion.github.io</p></details> |

In particular, we introduce manual bridges, a framework that expands the kinds of constraints that can be practically used to form so-called diffusion bridges. We develop a mechanism for combining multiple such constraints so that the resulting multiply-constrained model remains a manual bridge that respects all constraints. We also develop a mechanism for training a diffusion model that respects such multiple constraints while also adapting it to match a data distribution. We develop and extend theory demonstrating the mathematical validity of our mechanisms. Additionally, we demonstrate our mechanism in constrained generative modeling tasks, highlighting a particular high-value application in modeling trajectory initializations for path planning and control in autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Ready-to-React: Online Reaction Policy for Two-Character Interaction Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20370v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the task of generating two-character online interactions. Previously, two main settings existed for two-character interaction generation: (1) generating one's motions based on the counterpart's complete motion sequence, and (2) jointly generating two-character motions based on specific conditions. We argue that these settings fail to model the process of real-life two-character interactions, where humans will react to their counterparts in real time and act as independent individuals. In contrast, we propose an online reaction policy, called Ready-to-React, to generate the next character pose based on past observed motions. Each character has its own reaction policy as its "brain", enabling them to interact like real humans in a streaming manner. Our policy is implemented by incorporating a diffusion head into an auto-regressive model, which can dynamically respond to the counterpart's motions while effectively mitigating the error accumulation throughout the generation process. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the challenging boxing task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines and can generate extended motion sequences. Additionally, we show that our approach can be controlled by sparse signals, making it well-suited for VR and other online interactive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICLR 2025 conference paper</p></details> |

This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Removing Neural Signal Artifacts with Autoencoder-Targeted Adversarial Transformers (AT-AT)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05332v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromyogenic (EMG) noise is a major contamination source in EEG data that can impede accurate analysis of brain-specific neural activity. Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CNS 2025, Boston, MA, USA</p></details> |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit- thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving the Efficiency of a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Power Management System for HPC Clusters Using Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20348v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes. Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy. Experimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other training orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage. The best agent achieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66% improvement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15 minutes of idle time). In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by 9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective resource utilization. Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations, power levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to changing system parameters without retraining. These findings demonstrate that curriculum learning can significantly improve DRL-based power management in HPC, balancing energy savings, quality of service, and robustness to diverse configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 17 figures, accepted at Supercomputing Asia '25, published by ACM</p></details> |

However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://tianxingchen.github.io/G3Flow/, accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Furthermore, our model can adapt to unseen speaking styles using sample motion sequences, enabling the creation of 3D talking avatars with unique personal styles beyond the identities seen during training.

| **[Building reliable sim driving agents by scaling self-play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14706v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation agents are essential for designing and testing systems that interact with humans, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). These agents serve various purposes, from benchmarking AV performance to stress-testing system limits, but all applications share one key requirement: reliability. To enable systematic experimentation, a simulation agent must behave as intended. It should minimize actions that may lead to undesired outcomes, such as collisions, which can distort the signal-to-noise ratio in analyses. As a foundation for reliable sim agents, we propose scaling self-play to thousands of scenarios on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset under semi-realistic limits on human perception and control. Training from scratch on a single GPU, our agents nearly solve the full training set within a day. They generalize effectively to unseen test scenes, achieving a 99.8% goal completion rate with less than 0.8% combined collision and off-road incidents across 10,000 held-out scenarios. Beyond in-distribution generalization, our agents show partial robustness to out-of-distribution scenes and can be fine-tuned in minutes to reach near-perfect performance in those cases. We open-source the pre-trained agents and integrate them with a batched multi-agent simulator. Demonstrations of agent behaviors can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/reliable-sim-agents.</p></details> | v2 |
| **[Localized and Distributed Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Lossy Interconnections: Modeling and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05881v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a key technology to control the communication environment in future wireless networks. Recently, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS, we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE for publication</p></details> |
| **[Mobius: Text to Seamless Looping Video Generation via Latent Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20307v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Mobius, a novel method to generate seamlessly looping videos from text descriptions directly without any user annotations, thereby creating new visual materials for the multi-media presentation. Our method repurposes the pre-trained video latent diffusion model for generating looping videos from text prompts without any training. During inference, we first construct a latent cycle by connecting the starting and ending noise of the videos. Given that the temporal consistency can be maintained by the context of the video diffusion model, we perform multi-frame latent denoising by gradually shifting the first-frame latent to the end in each step. As a result, the denoising context varies in each step while maintaining consistency throughout the inference process. Moreover, the latent cycle in our method can be of any length. This extends our latent-shifting approach to generate seamless looping videos beyond the scope of the video diffusion model's context. Unlike previous cinemagraphs, the proposed method does not require an image as appearance, which will restrict the motions of the generated results. Instead, our method can produce more dynamic motion and better visual quality. We conduct multiple experiments and comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its efficacy in different scenarios. All the code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mobius-diffusion.github.io/ ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/YisuiTT/Mobius</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty Herding: One Active Learning Method for All Label Budgets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20644v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most active learning research has focused on methods which perform well when many labels are available, but can be dramatically worse than random selection when label budgets are small. Other methods have focused on the low-budget regime, but do poorly as label budgets increase. As the line between "low" and "high" budgets varies by problem, this is a serious issue in practice. We propose uncertainty coverage, an objective which generalizes a variety of low- and high-budget objectives, as well as natural, hyperparameter-light methods to smoothly interpolate between low- and high-budget regimes. We call greedy optimization of the estimate Uncertainty Herding; this simple method is computationally fast, and we prove that it nearly optimizes the distribution-level coverage. In experimental validation across a variety of active learning tasks, our proposal matches or beats state-of-the-art performance in essentially all cases; it is the only method of which we are aware that reliably works well in both low- and high-budget settings.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR2025 |

However, their reliance on well-prepared tools limits their applicability in the medical domain, which requires to train specialized models. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We present M3Builder, a novel multi-agent system designed to automate machine learning (ML) in medical imaging. At its core, M3Builder employs four specialized agents that collaborate to tackle complex, multi-step medical ML workflows, from automated data processing and environment configuration to self-contained auto debugging and model training. These agents operate within a medical imaging ML workspace, a structured environment designed to provide agents with free-text descriptions of datasets, training codes, and interaction tools, enabling seamless communication and task execution. (ii) To evaluate progress in automated medical imaging ML, we propose M3Bench, a benchmark comprising four general tasks on 14 training datasets, across five anatomies and three imaging modalities, covering both 2D and 3D data. (iii) We experiment with seven state-of-the-art large language models serving as agent cores for our system, such as Claude series, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3. Compared to existing ML agentic designs, M3Builder shows superior performance on completing ML tasks in medical imaging, achieving a 94.29% success rate using Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the agent core, showing huge potential towards fully automated machine learning in medical imaging.</p></details> | 38 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive automated data analytics and can be accessed here: https://github.com/ServiceNow/insight-bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Multi-source data are collected from different high-throughput technologies while multi-way data are collected over multiple dimensions, yielding multiple tensor arrays. Integrative analysis of these data sets is needed, e.g., to capture and synthesize different facets of complex biological systems. However, despite growing interest in multi-source and multi-way factorization techniques, methods that can handle data that are both multi-source and multi-way are limited. In this work, we propose a Multiple Linked Tensors Factorization (MULTIFAC) method extending the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition to simultaneously reduce the dimension of multiple multi-way arrays and approximate underlying signal. We first introduce a version of the CP factorization with L2 penalties on the latent factors, leading to rank sparsity. When extended to multiple linked tensors, the method automatically reveals latent components that are shared across data sources or individual to each data source. We also extend the decomposition algorithm to its expectation-maximization (EM) version to handle incomplete data with imputation. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate MULTIFAC's ability to (i) approximate underlying signal, (ii) identify shared and unshared structures, and (iii) impute missing data. The approach yields an interpretable decomposition on multi-way multi-omics data for a study on early-life iron deficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing model merging techniques primarily focus on resolving conflicts between task-specific models, they often overlook potential security threats, particularly the risk of backdoor attacks in the open-source model ecosystem. In this paper, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of existing model merging methods to backdoor attacks, identifying two critical challenges: backdoor succession and backdoor transfer. To address these issues, we propose a novel Defense-Aware Merging (DAM) approach that simultaneously mitigates task interference and backdoor vulnerabilities. Specifically, DAM employs a meta-learning-based optimization method with dual masks to identify a shared and safety-aware subspace for model merging. These masks are alternately optimized: the Task-Shared mask identifies common beneficial parameters across tasks, aiming to preserve task-specific knowledge while reducing interference, while the Backdoor-Detection mask isolates potentially harmful parameters to neutralize security threats. This dual-mask design allows us to carefully balance the preservation of useful knowledge and the removal of potential vulnerabilities. Compared to existing merging methods, DAM achieves a more favorable balance between performance and security, reducing the attack success rate by 2-10 percentage points while sacrificing only about 1% in accuracy. Furthermore, DAM exhibits robust performance and broad applicability across various types of backdoor attacks and the number of compromised models involved in the merging process. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/Yangjinluan/DAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>arxiv...</summary><p>arxiv version of ICLR2025</p></details> |

Real-time AutoML enables the design process to happen while the ML algorithm is being applied to a task. Real-time AutoML is an emerging research area, as such existing real-time AutoML techniques need improvement with respect to the quality of designs and time taken to create designs. To address these issues, this study proposes an Online Meta-learning for AutoML in Real-time (OnMAR) approach. Meta-learning gathers information about the optimisation process undertaken by the ML algorithm in the form of meta-features. Meta-features are used in conjunction with a meta-learner to optimise the optimisation process. The OnMAR approach uses a meta-learner to predict the accuracy of an ML design. If the accuracy predicted by the meta-learner is sufficient, the design is used, and if the predicted accuracy is low, an optimisation technique creates a new design. A genetic algorithm (GA) is the optimisation technique used as part of the OnMAR approach. Different meta-learners (k-nearest neighbours, random forest and XGBoost) are tested. The OnMAR approach is model-agnostic (i.e. not specific to a single real-time AutoML application) and therefore evaluated on three different real-time AutoML applications, namely: composing an image clustering algorithm, configuring the hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network, and configuring a video classification pipeline. The OnMAR approach is effective, matching or outperforming existing real-time AutoML approaches, with the added benefit of a faster runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First page is a graphical abstract, this is a journal article submission</p></details> |

Specifically, we propose a direct causal effect metric called the Probabilistic vAriational Causal Effect (PACE) and its variations adhering to certain postulates applicable to both non-binary and binary treatments. The PACE metric is derived by integrating the concept of total variation, representing the purely causal component, with interventions on the treatment value, combined with the probabilities of hypothetical transitioning between treatment levels. PACE features a parameter $d$, where lower values of $d$ correspond to scenarios emphasizing rare treatment values, while higher values of $d$ focus on situations where the causal impact of more frequent treatment levels is more relevant. Thus, instead of a single causal effect value, we provide a causal effect function of the degree $d$. Additionally, we introduce positive and negative PACE to measure the respective positive and negative causal changes in the outcome as exposure values shift. We also consider normalized versions of PACE, referred to MEAN PACE. Furthermore, we provide an identifiability criterion for PACE to handle counterfactual challenges in observational studies, and we define several generalizations of our methodology. Lastly, we compare our framework with other well-known causal frameworks through the analysis of various examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The Maker-Breaker game on $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is a combinatorial game between two players, Maker and Breaker. Beginning with Maker, the players take turns claiming vertices from $X$ that have not yet been claimed. Maker wins if she manages to claim all vertices of some hyperedge $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Breaker wins if he claims at least one vertex in every hyperedge. M. L. Rahman and Thomas Watson proved in 2021 that, even when only Maker-Breaker games on 6-uniform hypergraphs are considered, the decision problem of determining which player has a winning strategy is PSPACE-complete. They also showed that the problem is NL-hard when considering hypergraphs of rank 5. In this paper, we improve the latter result by showing that deciding who wins Maker-Breaker games on 5-uniform hypergraphs is still a PSPACE-complete problem. We achieve this by polynomial transformation from the problem of solving the generalized geography game on bipartite digraphs with vertex degrees 3 or less, which is known to be PSPACE-complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 tables containing figures, 5 references</p></details> |

However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection perform. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

On average, RLE outperforms noise-based methods, which perturb the agent's actions, and bonus-based exploration, which rewards the agent for attempting novel behaviors. The core idea of RLE is to encourage the agent to explore different parts of the environment by pursuing randomly sampled goals in a latent space. RLE is as simple as noise-based methods, as it avoids complex bonus calculations but retains the deep exploration benefits of bonus-based methods. Our experiments show that RLE improves performance on average in both discrete (e.g., Atari) and continuous control tasks (e.g., Isaac Gym), enhancing exploration while remaining a simple and general plug-in for existing RL algorithms.

Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation.

However, adhering to complex instructions remains a major challenge. Current approaches to generating complex instructions are often irrelevant to the current instruction requirements or suffer from limited scalability and diversity. Moreover, methods such as back-translation, while effective for simple instruction generation, fail to leverage the rich contents and structures in large web corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic iterative refinement framework to generate complex instructions with constraints, which not only better reflects the requirements of real scenarios but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions. The AIR framework consists of two stages: (1)Generate an initial instruction from a document; (2)Iteratively refine instructions with LLM-as-judge guidance by comparing the model's output with the document to incorporate valuable constraints. Finally, we construct the AIR-10K dataset with 10K complex instructions and demonstrate that instructions generated with our approach significantly improve the model's ability to follow complex instructions, outperforming existing methods for instruction generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally, 20 pages</p></details> |

In this study, we formulate and evaluate three fundamental deep learning approaches for conditional probability density modeling to quantify non-Gaussian aleatoric uncertainty: parametric, discretized, and generative modeling. We systematically compare the respective strengths and weaknesses of these three methods on simulated non-Gaussian densities as well as on real-world terrain-relative navigation data. Our results show that these deep learning methods can accurately capture complex uncertainty patterns, highlighting their potential for improving the reliability and robustness of estimation systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Currently, the state-of-the-art methods in MIG are primarily adapter-based. However, these methods necessitate retraining a new adapter each time a more advanced model is released, resulting in significant resource consumption. A methodology named Depth-Driven Decoupled Instance Synthesis (3DIS) has been introduced, which decouples MIG into two distinct phases: 1) depth-based scene construction and 2) detail rendering with widely pre-trained depth control models. The 3DIS method requires adapter training solely during the scene construction phase, while enabling various models to perform training-free detail rendering. Initially, 3DIS focused on rendering techniques utilizing U-Net architectures such as SD1.5, SD2, and SDXL, without exploring the potential of recent DiT-based models like FLUX. In this paper, we present 3DIS-FLUX, an extension of the 3DIS framework that integrates the FLUX model for enhanced rendering capabilities. Specifically, we employ the FLUX.1-Depth-dev model for depth map controlled image generation and introduce a detail renderer that manipulates the Attention Mask in FLUX's Joint Attention mechanism based on layout information. This approach allows for the precise rendering of fine-grained attributes of each instance. Our experimental results indicate that 3DIS-FLUX, leveraging the FLUX model, outperforms the original 3DIS method, which utilized SD2 and SDXL, and surpasses current state-of-the-art adapter-based methods in terms of both performance and image quality.

| **[Unveiling Redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs): A Systematic Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13588v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures.

Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one. Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error. Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the statistical rates and the computational efficiency are all dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024. v3 updated to camera-ready version with many typos fixed; v2 fixed typos, added Fig. 1 and added clarifications</p></details> |

Despite its promising capabilities, Lumina-T2X still encounters challenges including training instability, slow inference, and extrapolation artifacts. In this paper, we present Lumina-Next, an improved version of Lumina-T2X, showcasing stronger generation performance with increased training and inference efficiency. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of the Flag-DiT architecture and identify several suboptimal components, which we address by introducing the Next-DiT architecture with 3D RoPE and sandwich normalizations. To enable better resolution extrapolation, we thoroughly compare different context extrapolation methods applied to text-to-image generation with 3D RoPE, and propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE tailored for diffusion transformers. Additionally, we introduced a sigmoid time discretization schedule to reduce sampling steps in solving the Flow ODE and the Context Drop method to merge redundant visual tokens for faster network evaluation, effectively boosting the overall sampling speed. Thanks to these improvements, Lumina-Next not only improves the quality and efficiency of basic text-to-image generation but also demonstrates superior resolution extrapolation capabilities and multilingual generation using decoder-based LLMs as the text encoder, all in a zero-shot manner. To further validate Lumina-Next as a versatile generative framework, we instantiate it on diverse tasks including visual recognition, multi-view, audio, music, and point cloud generation, showcasing strong performance across these domains. By releasing all codes and model weights, we aim to advance the development of next-generation generative AI capable of universal modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at: https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-T2X</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose \textbf{DiT}, a self-supervised pre-trained \textbf{D}ocument \textbf{I}mage \textbf{T}ransformer model using large-scale unlabeled text images for Document AI tasks, which is essential since no supervised counterparts ever exist due to the lack of human-labeled document images. We leverage DiT as the backbone network in a variety of vision-based Document AI tasks, including document image classification, document layout analysis, table detection as well as text detection for OCR. Experiment results have illustrated that the self-supervised pre-trained DiT model achieves new state-of-the-art results on these downstream tasks, e.g. document image classification (91.11 $\rightarrow$ 92.69), document layout analysis (91.0 $\rightarrow$ 94.9), table detection (94.23 $\rightarrow$ 96.55) and text detection for OCR (93.07 $\rightarrow$ 94.29).

Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research directions.

However, the effectiveness of this approach can be influenced by adversaries, who may intentionally provide misleading preferences to manipulate the output in an undesirable or harmful direction. To tackle this challenge, we study a specific model within this problem domain--contextual dueling bandits with adversarial feedback, where the true preference label can be flipped by an adversary. We propose an algorithm namely robust contextual dueling bandits (RCDB), which is based on uncertainty-weighted maximum likelihood estimation. Our algorithm achieves an $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T}/\kappa+dC/\kappa)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $d$ is the dimension of the context, $\kappa$ is the lower bound of the derivative of the link function, and $ 0 \le C \le T$ is the total number of adversarial feedback. We also prove a lower bound to show that our regret bound is nearly optimal, both in scenarios with and without ($C=0$) adversarial feedback. Our work is the first to achieve nearly minimax optimal regret for dueling bandits in the presence of adversarial preference feedback. Additionally, for the sigmoid link function, we develop a novel algorithm that takes into account the effect of local derivatives into maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) analysis through a refined method for estimating the link function's derivative. This method helps us to eliminate the $\kappa$ dependence in the leading term with respect to $T$, which reduces the exponential dependence on the parameter radius $B$ to a polynomial dependence.</p></details> | <details><summary>44pag...</summary><p>44pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We introduce DELTA, a novel method that efficiently tracks every pixel in 3D space, enabling accurate motion estimation across entire videos. Our approach leverages a joint global-local attention mechanism for reduced-resolution tracking, followed by a transformer-based upsampler to achieve high-resolution predictions. Unlike existing methods, which are limited by computational inefficiency or sparse tracking, DELTA delivers dense 3D tracking at scale, running over 8x faster than previous methods while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we explore the impact of depth representation on tracking performance and identify log-depth as the optimal choice. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DELTA on multiple benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both 2D and 3D dense tracking tasks. Our method provides a robust solution for applications requiring fine-grained, long-term motion tracking in 3D space.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[State-Dependent Conformal Perception Bounds for Neuro-Symbolic Verification of Autonomous Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21308v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It remains a challenge to provide safety guarantees for autonomous systems with neural perception and control. A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state -- not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.</p></details> | Submitted to NeuS'25 |
| **[Discrete Shortest Paths in Optimal Power Flow Feasible Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02172v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal power flow (OPF) is a critical optimization problem for power systems to operate at points where cost or other operational objectives are optimized. Due to the non-convexity of the set of feasible OPF operating points, it is non-trivial to transition the power system from its current operating point to the optimal one without violating constraints. On top of that, practical considerations dictate that the transition should be achieved using a small number of small-magnitude control actions. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an algorithm for computing a transition path by framing it as a shortest path problem. This problem is formulated in terms of a discretized piece-wise linear path, where the number of pieces is fixed a priori in order to limit the number of control actions. This formulation yields a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with a sparse block tridiagonal structure, which we leverage by utilizing a specialized interior point method. An initial feasible path for our method is generated by solving a sequence of relaxations which are then tightened in a homotopy-like procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This work introduces the Masked Humanoid Controller (MHC), which supports all of these capabilities by tracking target trajectories over selected subsets of humanoid state variables while ensuring balance and robustness against disturbances. The MHC is trained in simulation using a carefully designed curriculum that imitates partially masked motions from a library of behaviors spanning standing, walking, optimized reference trajectories, re-targeted video clips, and human motion capture data. It also allows for combining joystick-based control with partial-body motion mimicry. We showcase simulation experiments validating the MHC's ability to execute a wide variety of behaviors from partially-specified target motions. Moreover, we demonstrate sim-to-real transfer on the real-world Digit V3 humanoid robot.

For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

Asymptotic properties of several DIB approaches (adaptive risk minimization, adaptive LASSO, Bayesian procedures with empirical power prior, fully Bayesian procedures, and a Bayes-frequentist compromise) are explored against shrinking to zero alternatives. As shown theoretically and with simulations, local asymptotic distributions of DIB estimators are often non-normal. A simple Gaussian setting with external information borrowing illustrates that none of the considered DIB methods outperforms others in terms of mean squared error (MSE): at different conflict values, the MSEs of DIBs are changing between the MSEs of the maximum likelihood estimators based on the current and pooled data. To uniquely determine an optimality criterion for DIB, a prior distribution on the conflict needs be either implicitly or explicitly determined using data independent considerations. Data independent assumptions on the conflict are also needed for DIB-based hypothesis testing. New families of DIB estimators parameterized by a sensitivity-to-conflict parameter S are suggested and their use is illustrated in an infant mortality example. The choice of S is determined in a data-independent manner by a cost-benefit compromise associated with the use of external data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Adaptive Keyframe Sampling for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21271v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled open-world visual understanding by injecting visual input as extra tokens into large language models (LLMs) as contexts. However, when the visual input changes from a single image to a long video, the above paradigm encounters difficulty because the vast amount of video tokens has significantly exceeded the maximal capacity of MLLMs. Therefore, existing video-based MLLMs are mostly established upon sampling a small portion of tokens from input data, which can cause key information to be lost and thus produce incorrect answers. This paper presents a simple yet effective algorithm named Adaptive Keyframe Sampling (AKS). It inserts a plug-and-play module known as keyframe selection, which aims to maximize the useful information with a fixed number of video tokens. We formulate keyframe selection as an optimization involving (1) the relevance between the keyframes and the prompt, and (2) the coverage of the keyframes over the video, and present an adaptive algorithm to approximate the best solution. Experiments on two long video understanding benchmarks validate that Adaptive Keyframe Sampling improves video QA accuracy (beyond strong baselines) upon selecting informative keyframes. Our study reveals the importance of information pre-filtering in video-based MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/ncTimTang/AKS.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

Among others, the scale of the random initialization, the learning rate, and early stopping all have crucial impact on the quality of the model learnt by stochastic gradient descent or related algorithms. In order to understand these phenomena, we study the training dynamics of large two-layer neural networks. We use a well-established technique from non-equilibrium statistical physics (dynamical mean field theory) to obtain an asymptotic high-dimensional characterization of this dynamics. This characterization applies to a Gaussian approximation of the hidden neurons non-linearity, and empirically captures well the behavior of actual neural network models. Our analysis uncovers several interesting new phenomena in the training dynamics: $(i)$ The emergence of a slow time scale associated with the growth in Gaussian/Rademacher complexity; $(ii)$ As a consequence, algorithmic inductive bias towards small complexity, but only if the initialization has small enough complexity; $(iii)$ A separation of time scales between feature learning and overfitting; $(iv)$ A non-monotone behavior of the test error and, correspondingly, a `feature unlearning' phase at large times.</p></details> | <details><summary>89 pa...</summary><p>89 pages; 62 pdf figures</p></details> |

However, PIM system-level benefits over traditional von Neumann architecture can be reduced when the memory array cannot fully store all the neural network (NN) weights. The NN size is increasing while the PIM design size cannot scale up accordingly due to area constraints. Therefore, this work targets the system performance optimization and exploration for compact PIM designs. We first analyze the impact of data movement on compact designs. Then, we propose a novel pipeline method that maximizes the reuse of NN weights to improve the throughput and energy efficiency of inference in compact chips. To further boost throughput, we introduce a scheduling algorithm to mitigate the pipeline bubble problem. Moreover, we investigate the trade-off between the network size and system performance for a compact PIM chip. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 2.35x and 0.5% improvement in throughput and energy efficiency, respectively. Compared to the area-unlimited design, our compact chip achieves approximately 56.5% of the throughput and 58.6% of the energy efficiency while using only one-third of the chip area, along with 1.3x improvement in area efficiency. Our compact design also outperforms the modern GPU with 4.56x higher throughput and 157x better energy efficiency. Besides, our compact design uses less than 20% of the system energy for data movement as batch size scales up.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AICAS 2025</p></details> |

Direct device-to-device (D2D) communication becomes a promising solution if the two terminals are located in close proximity. In this case, the D2D communications should coexist with cellular transmissions, so they must be carefully scheduled in order to avoid harmful interference impacts. In this paper, we outline a novel framework encompassing channel allocation, mode selection and power control for D2D communications. Power allocation is done in a distributed and cognitive fashion at the beginning of each time slot, based on local information, while channel/mode selection is performed in a centralized manner only at the beginning of an epoch, a time interval including a series of subsequent time slots. This hybrid approach guarantees an effective tradeoff between overhead and adaptivity. We analyze in depth the distributed power allocation mechanism, and we state a theorem which allows to derive the optimal power allocation strategy and to compute the corresponding throughput. Extensive simulations confirm the benefits granted by our approach, when compared with state-of-the-art distributed schemes, in terms of throughput and fairness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Albeit automated solutions are desirable, the limited availability of training data makes it difficult to develop such solutions using typical supervised learning frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel pre-training strategy using more widely available unannotated head CT scan data to pre-train a 3D Vision Transformer model prior to fine-tuning for the aneurysm detection task. Specifically, we modify masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training in the following ways: we use a factorized self-attention mechanism to make 3D attention computationally viable, we restrict the masked patches to areas near arteries to focus on areas where aneurysms are likely to occur, and we reconstruct not only CT scan intensity values but also artery distance maps, which describe the distance between each voxel and the closest artery, thereby enhancing the backbone's learned representations. Compared with SOTA aneurysm detection models, our approach gains +4-8% absolute Sensitivity at a false positive rate of 0.5. Code and weights will be released.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

To amortize the memory consumption across multiple devices in long-context training, inter-data partitioning (a.k.a. Data Parallelism) and intra-data partitioning (a.k.a. Context Parallelism) are commonly used. Current training frameworks predominantly treat the two techniques as orthogonal, and establish static communication groups to organize the devices as a static mesh (e.g., a 2D mesh). However, the sequences for LLM training typically vary in lengths, no matter for texts, multi-modalities or reinforcement learning. The mismatch between data heterogeneity and static mesh causes redundant communication and imbalanced computation, degrading the training efficiency. In this work, we introduce ByteScale, an efficient, flexible, and scalable LLM training framework for large-scale mixed training of long and short sequences. The core of ByteScale is a novel parallelism strategy, namely Hybrid Data Parallelism (HDP), which unifies the inter- and intra-data partitioning with a dynamic mesh design. In particular, we build a communication optimizer, which eliminates the redundant communication for short sequences by data-aware sharding and dynamic communication, and further compresses the communication cost for long sequences by selective offloading. Besides, we also develop a balance scheduler to mitigate the imbalanced computation by parallelism-aware data assignment. We evaluate ByteScale with the model sizes ranging from 7B to 141B, context lengths from 256K to 2048K, on a production cluster with more than 12,000 GPUs. Experiment results show that ByteScale outperforms the state-of-the-art training system by up to 7.89x.</p></details> | 12 pages, 21 figures |
| **[A Method of Selective Attention for Reservoir Based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21229v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training of deep reinforcement learning agents is slowed considerably by the presence of input dimensions that do not usefully condition the reward function. Existing modules such as layer normalization can be trained with weight decay to act as a form of selective attention, i.e. an input mask, that shrinks the scale of unnecessary inputs, which in turn accelerates training of the policy. However, we find a surprising result that adding numerous parameters to the computation of the input mask results in much faster training. A simple, high dimensional masking module is compared with layer normalization and a model without any input suppression. The high dimensional mask resulted in a four-fold speedup in training over the null hypothesis and a two-fold speedup in training over the layer normalization method.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Recurrent CircuitSAT Sampling for Sequential Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21226v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a novel GPU-accelerated circuit satisfiability (CircuitSAT) sampling technique for sequential circuits. This work is motivated by the requirement in constrained random verification (CRV) to generate input stimuli to validate the functionality of digital hardware circuits. A major challenge in CRV is generating inputs for sequential circuits, along with the appropriate number of clock cycles required to meet design constraints. Traditional approaches often use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) samplers to generate inputs by unrolling state transitions over a fixed number of clock cycles. However, these methods do not guarantee that a solution exists for the given number of cycles. Consequently, producing input stimuli together with the required clock cycles is essential for thorough testing and verification. Our approach converts the logical constraints and temporal behavior of sequential circuits into a recurrent CircuitSAT problem, optimized via gradient descent to efficiently explore a diverse set of valid solutions, including their associated number of clock cycles. By operating directly on the circuit structure, our method reinterprets the sampling process as a supervised multi-output regression task. This differentiable framework enables independent element-wise operations on each tensor element, facilitating parallel execution during learning. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with substantial runtime improvements (up to 105.1x) over state-of-the-art heuristic samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive evaluations on circuit problems from the ISCAS-89 and ITC'99 benchmark suites.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Current approaches, however, often suffer from very slow sampling times or generate molecules with poor chemical validity. Addressing these limitations, we propose Semla, a scalable E(3)-equivariant message passing architecture. We further introduce an unconditional 3D molecular generation model, SemlaFlow, which is trained using equivariant flow matching to generate a joint distribution over atom types, coordinates, bond types and formal charges. Our model produces state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with as few as 20 sampling steps, corresponding to a two order-of-magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we highlight limitations of current evaluation methods for 3D generation and propose new benchmark metrics for unconditional molecular generators. Finally, using these new metrics, we compare our model's ability to generate high quality samples against current approaches and further demonstrate SemlaFlow's strong performance.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[Generalized Decomposition Priors on R2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10180v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of continuous shrinkage priors in high-dimensional linear models has gained widespread attention due to their practical and theoretical advantages. Among them, the R2D2 prior has gained popularity for its intuitive specification of the proportion of explained variance (R2) and its theoretically grounded properties. The R2D2 prior allocates variance among regression terms through a Dirichlet decomposition. However, this approach inherently limits the dependency structure among variance components to the negative dependence modeled by the Dirichlet distribution, which is fully determined by the mean. This limitation hinders the prior's ability to capture more nuanced or positive dependency patterns that may arise in real-world data. To address this, we propose the Generalized Decomposition R2 (GDR2) prior, which replaces the Dirichlet decomposition with the more flexible Logistic-Normal distribution and its variants. By allowing richer dependency structures, the GDR2 prior accommodates more realistic and adaptable competition among variance components, enhancing the expressiveness and applicability of R2-based priors in practice. Through simulations and real-world benchmarks, we demonstrate that the GDR2 prior improves out-of-sample predictive performance and parameter recovery compared to the R2D2 prior. Our framework bridges the gap between flexibility in variance decomposition and practical implementation, advancing the utility of shrinkage priors in complex regression settings.</p></details> | 50 pages, 28 figures |

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transaction of Communications.

This improves upon the best known $4$- and respectively $5$-approximations and addresses an open question posed by Agarwal, Rajakrishnan, Narayan, Agarwal, Shmoys, and Vahdat [Aga+18], Fukunaga [Fuk22], and others. We additionally show that in an asymptotic setting, the algorithm achieves a ($2+\epsilon$)-approximation, which is essentially optimal under $\mathbb{P}\neq\mathbb{NP}$. The improvements are achieved using a novel edge allocation scheme using iterated LP rounding together with a framework which enables establishing strong bounds for combinations of several edge allocation algorithms.</p></details> | 27 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Disentangling Uncertainty for Safe Social Navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10655v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous mobile robots are increasingly used in pedestrian-rich environments where safe navigation and appropriate human interaction are crucial. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables socially integrated robot behavior, challenges persist in novel or perturbed scenarios to indicate when and why the policy is uncertain. Unknown uncertainty in decision-making can lead to collisions or human discomfort and is one reason why safe and risk-aware navigation is still an open problem. This work introduces a novel approach that integrates aleatoric, epistemic, and predictive uncertainty estimation into a DRL navigation framework for policy distribution uncertainty estimates. We, therefore, incorporate Observation-Dependent Variance (ODV) and dropout into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. For different types of perturbations, we compare the ability of deep ensembles and Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) to estimate the uncertainties of the policy. In uncertain decision-making situations, we propose to change the robot's social behavior to conservative collision avoidance. The results show improved training performance with ODV and dropout in PPO and reveal that the training scenario has an impact on the generalization. In addition, MC-dropout is more sensitive to perturbations and correlates the uncertainty type to the perturbation better. With the safe action selection, the robot can navigate in perturbed environments with fewer collisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication, 8 pages, 6 figures and 4 tables</p></details> |

Following certain simplifications of the update to enable a linear scaling with dimension and a few other enhancements, we apply FINDER to a range of problems, starting with some IEEE benchmark objective functions to a couple of archetypal data-driven problems in deep networks to certain cases of physics-informed deep networks. The performance of the new method vis-\'a-vis the well-known Adam and a few others bears evidence to its promise and potentialities for large dimensional optimization problems of practical interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 14 figures, 1 tables, 1 supplementary material.

To address these challenges, pseudo-coresets, small learnable datasets that mimic the entire data, have been proposed. Bayesian Neural Networks, which offer predictive uncertainty and probabilistic interpretation for deep neural networks, also face issues with large-scale datasets due to their high-dimensional parameter space. Prior works on Bayesian Pseudo-Coresets (BPC) attempt to reduce the computational load for computing weight posterior distribution by a small number of pseudo-coresets but suffer from memory inefficiency during BPC training and sub-optimal results. To overcome these limitations, we propose Variational Bayesian Pseudo-Coreset (VBPC), a novel approach that utilizes variational inference to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution, reducing memory usage and computational costs while improving performance across benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR2025)</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Accurate Gigapixel Pathological Image Classification with Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21130v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to processing numerous patches from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[A general partitioning strategy for non-centralized control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21126v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partitioning is a fundamental challenge for non-centralized control of large-scale systems, such as hierarchical, decentralized, distributed, and coalitional strategies. The problem consists of finding a decomposition of a network of dynamical systems into system units for which local controllers can be designed. Unfortunately, despite its critical role, a generalized approach to partitioning applicable to every system is still missing from the literature. This paper introduces a novel partitioning framework that integrates an algorithmic selection of fundamental system units (FSUs), considered indivisible entities, with an aggregative procedure, either algorithmic or optimization-based, to select composite system units (CSUs) made of several FSUs. A key contribution is the introduction of a global network metric, the partition index, which quantitatively balances intra- and inter-CSU interactions, with a granularity parameter accounting for the size of CSUs, allowing for their selection at different levels of aggregation. The proposed method is validated through case studies in distributed model predictive control (DMPC) for linear and hybrid systems, showing significant reductions in computation time and cost while maintaining or improving control performance w.r.t. conventional strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, contains additional appendix with extra material</p></details> |
| **[The Complexity-Performance Tradeoff in Resource Allocation for URLLC Exploiting Dynamic CSI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21121v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenging applications envisioned for the future Internet of Things networks are making it urgent to develop fast and scalable resource allocation algorithms able to meet the stringent reliability and latency constraints typical of the Ultra Reliable, Low Latency Communications (URLLC). However, there is an inherent tradeoff between complexity and performance to be addressed: sophisticated resource allocation methods providing optimized spectrum utilization are challenged by the scale of applications and the concomitant stringent latency constraints. Whether non-trivial resource allocation approaches can be successfully applied in large-scale network instances is still an open question that this paper aims to address. More specifically, we consider a scenario in which Channel State Information (CSI) is used to improve spectrum allocation in a radio environment that experiences channel time correlation. Channel correlation allows the usage of CSI for longer time before an update, thus lowering the overhead burden. Following this intuition, we propose a dynamic pilot transmission allocation scheme in order to adaptively tune the CSI age. We systematically analyze the improvement of this approach applied to a sophisticated, recently introduced graph-based resource allocation method that we extend here to account for CSI. The results show that, even in very dense networks and accounting for the higher computational time of the graph-based approach, this algorithm is able to improve spectrum efficiency by over 12% as compared to a greedy heuristic, and that dynamic pilot transmissions allocation can further boost its performance in terms of fairness, while concomitantly further increase spectrum efficiency of 3-5%. \</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

However, literature suggests that survey length is a contributing factor to careless responding, with longer questionnaires yielding higher probability that participants start responding carelessly. Consequently, in long surveys a large number of participants may engage in careless responding, posing a major threat to internal validity. We propose a novel method for identifying the onset of careless responding (or an absence thereof) that searches for a changepoint in combined measurements of multiple dimensions in which carelessness may manifest, such as inconsistency and invariability. It is highly flexible, based on machine learning, and provides statistical guarantees for controlling the false positive rate. In simulation experiments, the proposed method achieves high accuracy in identifying carelessness onset and discriminates well between attentive and various types of careless responding, even when a large number of careless respondents are present. An empirical application highlights how identifying partial carelessness uncovers novel insights on careless responding behavior. Furthermore, we provide the freely available open source software package "carelessonset" to facilitate adoption by empirical researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>88 pa...</summary><p>88 pages, 11 figures (+22 in appendix)</p></details> |

Typically, materials are ferried between these machines using a team of mobile robots. To embed a manufacturing procedure in a smart factory, a factory operator must a) assign its processes to the smart factory's machines and b) determine how agents should carry materials between machines. A good embedding maximizes the smart factory's throughput; the rate at which it outputs products. Existing smart factory management systems solve the aforementioned problems sequentially, limiting the throughput that they can achieve. In this paper we introduce ACES, the Anytime Cyclic Embedding Solver, the first solver which jointly optimizes the assignment of processes to machines and the assignment of paths to agents.

However, the relationship between these two paradigms is not well-studied. This work aims to systematically investigate the robustness and performance of SARL and MARL in the same task. We first analytically show that independent Gaussian policies optimized by policy-gradient based SARL and MARL are equivalent under full-state observations. Following, we empirically show that in certain inherently single-agent tasks, perhaps surprisingly, we can use multiple agents to control a robot such that each agent only has access to partial observations. Since in these cases an agent does not depend on full state information multi-agent policies can provide additional robustness to perturbations and failures. Experiments on an illustrative decentralized control task and a mobile manipulation task with a real robot show that multiple agents with access to partial observations outperform a single agent when parts of the system fail.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |

Despite many advantages, neural fields often have a high training cost, which prevents a broader adoption. In this paper, we focus on a popular family of neural fields, called sinusoidal neural fields (SNFs), and study how it should be initialized to maximize the training speed. We find that the standard initialization scheme for SNFs -- designed based on the signal propagation principle -- is suboptimal. In particular, we show that by simply multiplying each weight (except for the last layer) by a constant, we can accelerate SNF training by 10$\times$. This method, coined $\textit{weight scaling}$, consistently provides a significant speedup over various data domains, allowing the SNFs to train faster than more recently proposed architectures. To understand why the weight scaling works well, we conduct extensive theoretical and empirical analyses which reveal that the weight scaling not only resolves the spectral bias quite effectively but also enjoys a well-conditioned optimization trajectory.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Our experimental results reveal that matrix entropy effectively captures the variations in information content of data representations and classification head vectors as neural networks approach Neural Collapse during supervised training, while also serving as a robust metric for measuring similarity among data samples. Leveraging this property, we propose Cross-Model Alignment (CMA) loss to optimize the fine-tuning of pretrained models. To characterize the dynamics of neural networks nearing the Neural Collapse state, we introduce two novel metrics: the Matrix Mutual Information Ratio (MIR) and the Matrix Entropy Difference Ratio (HDR), which quantitatively assess the interactions between data representations and classification heads in supervised learning, with theoretical optimal values derived under the Neural Collapse state. Our experiments demonstrate that MIR and HDR effectively explain various phenomena in neural networks, including the dynamics of standard supervised training, linear mode connectivity. Moreover, we use MIR and HDR to analyze the dynamics of grokking, which is a fascinating phenomenon in supervised learning where a model unexpectedly exhibits generalization long after achieving training data fit.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.03999</p></details> |

Since the problem of realizing Ultra Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) is becoming more and more important, it has attracted the attention of researchers, and new efficient resource allocation algorithms are necessary. In this paper, we consider a challenging scenario where the available spectrum might be fragmented across non-adjacent portions of the band, and channels are differently affected by interference coming from surrounding networks. Furthermore, Channel State Information (CSI) is assumed to be unavailable, thus requiring an allocation of resources based only on topology information and channel statistics. To address this challenge in a dense smart factory scenario where devices periodically transmit their data to a common receiver, we present a novel resource allocation methodology based on a graph-theoretical approach originally designed to allocate mobility resources in on-demand, shared transportation. The proposed methodology is compared with two benchmark allocation strategies, showing its ability of increasing spectral efficiency of as much as 50% with respect to the best performing benchmark. Contrary to what happens in many resource allocation settings, this increase in spectrum efficiency does not come at the expense of fairness, which is also increased as compared to benchmark algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

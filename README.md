| **[Automated Detection of Visual Attribute Reliance with a Self-Reflective Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21704v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object detector.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 10 figures, Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[Visual Diffusion Models are Geometric Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21697v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple Polygon Problem. Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one. The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation. Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving. Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kariander1.github.io/visual-geo-solver/</p></details> |
| **[Causal Climate Emulation with Bayesian Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09891v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physically-based causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a novel approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.</p></details> | 37 pages, 26 figures |
| **[BachVid: Training-Free Video Generation with Consistent Background and Character](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21696v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images. Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training, offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without relying on reference images or additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wolfball.github.io/bachvid</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Goals for Autonomous Agents: Model-Based Exploration in Virtual Zebrafish Predicts Ethological Behavior and Whole-Brain Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00138v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in reward-free environments, including a class of methods known as model-based intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and do not converge to an exploratory policy, thus failing to capture robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in ethological, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed after the principles of autonomous exploration in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) achieves animal-like exploration by tracking divergence between an online world model and a fixed prior learned from an ecological niche. To the best of our knowledge, we introduce the first autonomous embodied agent that predicts brain data entirely from self-supervised optimization of an intrinsic goal -- without any behavioral or neural training data -- demonstrating that 3M-Progress agents capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously behaving larval zebrafish, thereby providing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Minimum Threat Exposure using Physics-Informed Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17762v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We apply a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the two-point boundary value problem (BVP) arising from the necessary conditions postulated by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for optimal control. Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 Indian Control Conference</p></details> |
| **[On Uncertainty Calibration for Equivariant Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21691v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR).

| **[System-Embedded Diffusion Bridge Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23726v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving inverse problems -- recovering signals from incomplete or noisy measurements -- is fundamental in science and engineering. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for this task. Two main paradigms have formed: unsupervised approaches that adapt pretrained generative models to inverse problems, and supervised bridge methods that train stochastic processes conditioned on paired clean and corrupted data. While the former typically assume knowledge of the measurement model, the latter have largely overlooked this structural information. We introduce System embedded Diffusion Bridge Models (SDBs), a new class of supervised bridge methods that explicitly embed the known linear measurement system into the coefficients of a matrix-valued SDE. This principled integration yields consistent improvements across diverse linear inverse problems and demonstrates robust generalization under system misspecification between training and deployment, offering a promising solution to real-world applications.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[On Thin Ice: Towards Explainable Conservation Monitoring via Attribution and Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21689v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii) faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box" predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Imageomics Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[SimuRA: A World-Model-Driven Simulative Reasoning Architecture for General Goal-Oriented Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23773v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents built on foundation models hold enormous promise. Current practice, however, focuses on a one-task-one-agent approach, which not only falls short of scalability and generality, but also faces practical limitations from black-box autoregressive reasoning, where decisions unfold token by token without explicit simulation or counterfactual evaluation of outcomes. Humans, on the other hand, reason and plan by mentally simulating the consequences of actions within an internal model of the world -- a capability that supports flexible, goal-directed behavior across diverse contexts. Moving towards a more general and powerful AI agent, we introduce SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning. Based on a principled formulation of an optimal agent in any general environment, SimuRA addresses the limitations of black-box autoregressive reasoning by incorporating the world model for planning via simulation. Our prototype world model is implemented using LLMs as a substrate, leveraging the natural language as a discrete, hierarchical representation grounded in concepts for planning, while remaining model-agnostic. On complex web-browsing tasks such as flight search, SimuRA improves the success rate from 0% to 32.2% compared to a representative open-web agent baseline. Across tasks, world-model-based planning achieves up to 124% higher task completion rates than a matched black-box autoregressive baseline, demonstrating the advantages of simulative reasoning. We release ReasonerAgent-Web, a web-browsing agent built on SimuRA, as an open-source research demo.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission has been updated to adjust the scope and presentation of the work</p></details> |

| **[Knee-Deep in C-RASP: A Transformer Depth Hierarchy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16055v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been observed that transformers with greater depth (that is, more layers) have more capabilities, but can we establish formally which capabilities are gained? We answer this question with a theoretical proof followed by an empirical study. First, we consider transformers that round to fixed precision except inside attention. We show that this subclass of transformers is expressively equivalent to the programming language C-RASP and this equivalence preserves depth. Second, we prove that deeper C-RASP programs are more expressive than shallower C-RASP programs, implying that deeper transformers are more expressive than shallower transformers (within the subclass mentioned above). The same is also proven for transformers with positional encodings (like RoPE and ALiBi). These results are established by studying a temporal logic with counting operators equivalent to C-RASP. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our theory predicts the depth required for transformers without positional encodings to length-generalize on a family of sequential dependency tasks.</p></details> | 35 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer for Human Activity Intensity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13678v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human activity intensity prediction is crucial to many location-based services. Despite tremendous progress in modeling dynamics of human activity, most existing methods overlook physical constraints of spatial interaction, leading to uninterpretable spatial correlations and over-smoothing phenomenon. To address these limitations, this work proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework, namely Gravity-informed Spatiotemporal Transformer (Gravityformer) by integrating the universal law of gravitation to refine transformer attention. Specifically, it (1) estimates two spatially explicit mass parameters based on spatiotemporal embedding feature, (2) models the spatial interaction in end-to-end neural network using proposed adaptive gravity model to learn the physical constraint, and (3) utilizes the learned spatial interaction to guide and mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon in transformer attention. Moreover, a parallel spatiotemporal graph convolution transformer is proposed for achieving a balance between coupled spatial and temporal learning. Systematic experiments on six real-world large-scale activity datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative superiority of our model over state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, the learned gravity attention matrix can be not only disentangled and interpreted based on geographical laws, but also improved the generalization in zero-shot cross-region inference.

| **[Mixture of Experts in Image Classification: What's the Sweet Spot?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18322v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown promising potential for parameter-efficient scaling across domains. However, their application to image classification remains limited, often requiring billion-scale datasets to be competitive. In this work, we explore the integration of MoE layers into image classification architectures using open datasets. We conduct a systematic analysis across different MoE configurations and model scales. We find that moderate parameter activation per sample provides the best trade-off between performance and efficiency. However, as the number of activated parameters increases, the benefits of MoE diminish. Our analysis yields several practical insights for vision MoE design. First, MoE layers most effectively strengthen tiny and mid-sized models, while gains taper off for large-capacity networks and do not redefine state-of-the-art ImageNet performance. Second, a Last-2 placement heuristic offers the most robust cross-architecture choice, with Every-2 slightly better for Vision Transform (ViT), and both remaining effective as data and model scale increase. Third, larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-21k) allow more experts, up to 16, for ConvNeXt to be utilized effectively without changing placement, as increased data reduces overfitting and promotes broader expert specialization. Finally, a simple linear router performs best, suggesting that additional routing complexity yields no consistent benefit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |

With the rapid growth of AI-driven workloads, such fluctuations, along with fast ramp patterns, are expected to exacerbate stressed grid conditions and system instabilities. We consider a few open-source AI data center consumption profiles from the MIT supercloud datasets, along with generating a few experimental HPC job-distribution-based inference profiles. Subsequently, we develop analytical methodologies for real-time assessment of grid stability, focusing on both transient and small-signal stability assessments. Energy-flow-like metrics for nonlinear transient stability, formulated by computing localized data center bus kinetic-like flows and coupling interactions with neighboring buses over varying time windows, help provide operators with real-time assessments of the regional grid stress in the data center hubs. On the other hand, small-signal stability metrics, constructed from analytical state matrices under variable operating conditions during a fast ramping period, enable snapshot-based assessments of data center load fluctuations and provide enhanced observability into evolving grid conditions. By quantifying the stability impacts of large data center clusters, studies conducted in the modified IEEE benchmark $68-$bus model support improved operator situational awareness to capture risks in reliable integration of large data center loads.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Metropolis-Hastings Sampling for 3D Gaussian Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12945v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an adaptive sampling framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that leverages comprehensive multi-view photometric error signals within a unified Metropolis-Hastings approach. Vanilla 3DGS heavily relies on heuristic-based density-control mechanisms (e.g., cloning, splitting, and pruning), which can lead to redundant computations or premature removal of beneficial Gaussians. Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, achieving faster convergence while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

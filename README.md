| **[Point3R: Streaming 3D Reconstruction with Explicit Spatial Pointer Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02863v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs.

| **[LiteReality: Graphics-Ready 3D Scene Reconstruction from RGB-D Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02861v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas. LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials, and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact, editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark, along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets.

Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.

| **[MvHo-IB: Multi-View Higher-Order Information Bottleneck for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02847v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent evidence suggests that modeling higher-order interactions (HOIs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods, including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is available at https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI-25, code is available at \url{https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB}</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model-Driven Closed-Loop UAV Operation with Semantic Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01930v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent operation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase of task complexity.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[DNN-Based Precoding in RIS-Aided mmWave MIMO Systems With Practical Phase Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02824v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, the precoding design is investigated for maximizing the throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight (LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network (DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase. These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted by IEEE Globecom 2024 Workshops</p></details> |
| **[Time-Masked Transformers with Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation for Neural Speech Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02800v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech neuroprostheses aim to restore communication for people with severe paralysis by decoding speech directly from neural activity. To accelerate algorithmic progress, a recent benchmark released intracranial recordings from a paralyzed participant attempting to speak, along with a baseline decoding algorithm. Prior work on the benchmark showed impressive accuracy gains. However, these gains increased computational costs and were not demonstrated in a real-time decoding setting. Here, we make three contributions that pave the way towards accurate, efficient, and real-time neural speech decoding. First, we incorporate large amounts of time masking during training. On average, over $50\%$ of each trial is masked. Second, we replace the gated recurrent unit (GRU) architecture used in the baseline algorithm with a compact Transformer. The Transformer architecture uses $77\%$ fewer parameters, cuts peak GPU memory usage by $36\%$ relative, and is significantly faster to calibrate relative to the GRU. Third, we design a lightweight variant of an existing test-time adaptation method developed for decoding handwriting from neural activity. Our variant adapts the model using multiple time masked augmentations of a single trial and requires only one gradient step per trial. Together, these contributions reduce word error rate by $19.5\%$ and effectively mitigate performance degradations across held-out days in a real-time decoding setting while substantially lowering computational costs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Thinking with Images for Multimodal Reasoning: Foundations, Methods, and Future Frontiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23918v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in multimodal reasoning has been significantly advanced by textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions. (1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications. (4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions. By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint in progress.

| **[Self-Correction Bench: Revealing and Addressing the Self-Correction Blind Spot in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02778v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have become transformative, they still make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic 'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences, unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback. Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving their reliability and trustworthiness.</p></details> | 31 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Fast and Simplex: 2-Simplicial Attention in Triton](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02754v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize token efficiency. In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that $2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, with appendix 25 pages</p></details> |
| **[Linear Attention with Global Context: A Multipole Attention Mechanism for Vision and Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02748v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks, from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work, we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in $n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator (MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECLR Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Indexing Tries within Entropy-Bounded Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02728v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of indexing and compressing tries using a BWT-based approach. Specifically, we consider a succinct and compressed representation of the XBWT of Ferragina et al.\ [FOCS '05, JACM '09] corresponding to the analogous of the FM-index [FOCS '00, JACM '05] for tries. This representation allows to efficiently count the number of nodes reached by a given string pattern. To analyze the space complexity of the above trie index, we propose a proof for the combinatorial problem of counting the number of tries with a given symbol distribution. We use this formula to define a worst-case entropy measure for tries, as well as a notion of k-th order empirical entropy. In particular, we show that the relationships between these two entropy measures are similar to those between the corresponding well-known measures for strings. We use these measures to prove that the XBWT of a trie can be encoded within a space bounded by our k-th order empirical entropy plus a o(n) term, with n being the number of nodes in the trie. Notably, as happens for strings, this space bound can be reached for every sufficiently small k simultaneously. Finally, we compare the space complexity of the above index with that of the r-index for tries proposed by Prezza [SODA '21] and we prove that in some cases the FM-index for tries is asymptotically smaller.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, submitted to SPIRE 2025</p></details> |
| **[AC-DiT: Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer for Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01961v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator, primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand, they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://ac-dit.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Faster Algorithm for Bounded Tree Edit Distance in the Low-Distance Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02701v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tree edit distance is a natural dissimilarity measure between rooted ordered trees whose nodes are labeled over an alphabet $\Sigma$. It is defined as the minimum number of node edits (insertions, deletions, and relabelings) required to transform one tree into the other. In the weighted variant, the edits have associated costs (depending on the involved node labels) normalized so that each cost is at least one, and the goal is to minimize the total cost of edits. The unweighted tree edit distance between two trees of total size $n$ can be computed in $O(n^{2.6857})$ time; in contrast, determining the weighted tree edit distance is fine-grained equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem and requires $n^3/2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$ time [Nogler et al.; STOC'25]. These super-quadratic running times are unattractive for large but very similar trees, which motivates the bounded version of the problem, where the runtime is parameterized by the computed distance $k$, potentially yielding faster algorithms for $k\ll n$. Previous best algorithms for the bounded unweighted setting run in $O(nk^2\log n)$ time [Akmal & Jin; ICALP'21] and $O(n + k^7\log k)$ time [Das et al.; STOC'23]. For the weighted variant, the only known running time has been $O(n + k^{15})$. We present an $O(n + k^6\log k)$-time algorithm for computing the bounded tree edit distance in both the weighted and unweighted settings. Our approach begins with an alternative $O(nk^2\log n)$-time algorithm that handles weights and is significantly easier to analyze than the existing counterpart. We then introduce a novel optimization that leverages periodic structures within the input trees. To utilize it, we modify the $O(k^5)$-size $O(n)$-time universal kernel, the central component of the prior $O(n + k^{O(1)})$-time algorithms, so that it produces instances containing these periodic structures.</p></details> | Accepted to ESA 2025 |
| **[RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/Joker3993/RLHGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

| **[Learning few-step posterior samplers by unfolding and distillation of diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02686v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages |

In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer, while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop decluttering tasks.

To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism, which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting (98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1% accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio tasks, paving the way for broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech2025</p></details> |

Agentic AI-based Hardware Design & Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02660v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Integrated Circuits (ICs) are becoming increasingly complex, and so is their development process. Hardware design verification entails a methodical and disciplined approach to the planning, development, execution, and sign-off of functionally correct hardware designs. This tedious process requires significant effort and time to ensure a bug-free tape-out. The field of Natural Language Processing has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful models, often referred to as Generative AI (GenAI), have revolutionized how machines understand and generate human language, enabling unprecedented advancements in a wide array of applications, including hardware design verification. This paper presents an agentic AI-based approach to hardware design verification, which empowers AI agents, in collaboration with Humain-in-the-Loop (HITL) intervention, to engage in a more dynamic, iterative, and self-reflective process, ultimately performing end-to-end hardware design and verification. This methodology is evaluated on five open-source designs, achieving over 95% coverage with reduced verification time while demonstrating superior performance, adaptability, and configurability.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 38th SBC/SBMicro/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems Design (SBCCI), August 25-29, 2025, Manaus, BRAZIL</p></details> |
| **[A Matrix Variational Auto-Encoder for Variant Effect Prediction in Pharmacogenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02624v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work, we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.</p></details> | 12+8 pages |

Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall.

To solve these issues, we clarify the objective and references for weakly supervised ultrasound image segmentation, presenting a framework with high-confidence pseudo-labels to represent topological and anatomical information and high-rationality losses to capture multi-level discriminative features. Specifically, we fuse geometric transformations of four-point annotations and MedSAM model results prompted by specific annotations to generate high-confidence box, foreground, and background labels. Our high-rationality learning strategy includes: 1) Alignment loss measuring spatial consistency between segmentation and box label, and topological continuity within the foreground label, guiding the network to perceive nodule location; 2) Contrastive loss pulling features from labeled foreground regions while pushing features from labeled foreground and background regions, guiding the network to learn nodule and background feature distribution; 3) Prototype correlation loss measuring consistency between correlation maps derived by comparing features with foreground and background prototypes, refining uncertain regions to accurate nodule edges. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TN3K and DDTI datasets.

We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data, AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

We extend them with a trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy trade-off.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 Figures |

While voxelization is the most common of them, meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a framework that joins the three representations under differentiable transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit. Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and brain vessels.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Lightweight Structure-Aware Attention for Visual Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16289v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy, and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs) as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Bounded Weighted Edit Distance: Dynamic Algorithms and Matching Lower Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02548v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The edit distance $ed(X,Y)$ of two strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^*$ is the minimum number of character edits (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) needed to transform $X$ into $Y$. Its weighted counterpart $ed^w(X,Y)$ minimizes the total cost of edits, which are specified using a function $w$, normalized so that each edit costs at least one. The textbook dynamic-programming procedure, given strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^{\le n}$ and oracle access to $w$, computes $ed^w(X,Y)$ in $O(n^2)$ time. Nevertheless, one can achieve better running times if the computed distance, denoted $k$, is small: $O(n+k^2)$ for unit weights [Landau and Vishkin; JCSS'88] and $\tilde{O}(n+\sqrt{nk^3})$ for arbitrary weights [Cassis, Kociumaka, Wellnitz; FOCS'23]. In this paper, we study the dynamic version of the weighted edit distance problem, where the goal is to maintain $ed^w(X,Y)$ for strings $X,Y\in \Sigma^{\le n}$ that change over time, with each update specified as an edit in $X$ or $Y$. Very recently, Gorbachev and Kociumaka [STOC'25] showed that the unweighted distance $ed(X,Y)$ can be maintained in $\tilde{O}(k)$ time per update after $\tilde{O}(n+k^2)$-time preprocessing; here, $k$ denotes the current value of $ed(X,Y)$. Their algorithm generalizes to small integer weights, but the underlying approach is incompatible with large weights. Our main result is a dynamic algorithm that maintains $ed^w(X,Y)$ in $\tilde{O}(k^{3-\gamma})$ time per update after $\tilde{O}(nk^\gamma)$-time preprocessing. Here, $\gamma\in [0,1]$ is a real trade-off parameter and $k\ge 1$ is an integer threshold fixed at preprocessing time, with $\infty$ returned whenever $ed^w(X,Y)>k$. We complement our algorithm with conditional lower bounds showing fine-grained optimality of our trade-off for $\gamma \in [0.5,1)$ and justifying our choice to fix $k$.</p></details> | ESA 2025 |
| **[MedFormer: Hierarchical Medical Vision Transformer with Content-Aware Dual Sparse Selection Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02488v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities. Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks.

Furthermore, Mesh Silksong produces polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology, watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also significantly improved geometric integrity.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages main text, 14 pages appendix, 23 figures</p></details> |

Joint spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) emerges as a low-overhead transmission scheme for multi-user equipment (UE) scenarios, typically requiring complex matrix decomposition to achieve block-diagonalization of the effective channel matrix. In this study, we introduce an innovative JSDM design that leverages RISs to customize channels, thereby streamlining the overall procedures. By strategically positioning RISs at the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) directions of the base station (BS), we establish orthogonal line-of-sight links within the BS-RIS channel, enabling a straightforward pre-beamforming design. Based on UE grouping, we devise reflected beams of the RIS with optimized directions to mitigate inter-group interference in the RISs-UEs channel. An approximation of the channel cross-correlation coefficient is derived and serves as a foundation for the RISs-UEs association, further diminishing inter-group interference. Numerical results substantiate the efficacy of our RIS-customized JSDM in not only achieving effective channel block-diagonalization but also in significantly enhancing the sum spectral efficiency for multi-UE transmissions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages, freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU) simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady process in a continual manner.

A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into a personalized 3D heart model. We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of 5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical practice.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version has been reviewed and accepted for presentation at the Future Technologies Conference (FTC) 2025, to be held on 6 & 7 November 2025 in Munich, Germany. 17 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, forecasting multivariate time series with Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal (cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters, delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models.

Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture, which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these, Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic Transformer with other deep learning techniques (convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail.

Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight, runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference. Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling, pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora, Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance, reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36% PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video generation in both research and practical applications.

In this article, we consider a class of generalized coarsened procedures for confounding. At a high level, these procedures can be viewed as performing a clustering of confounding variables, followed by treatment effect and attendant variance estimation using the confounder strata. In addition, we propose two new algorithms for generalized coarsened confounding. While Iacus et al. (2011) developed some statistical properties for one special case in our class of procedures, we instead develop a general asymptotic framework. We provide asymptotic results for the average causal effect estimator as well as providing conditions for consistency. In addition, we provide an asymptotic justification for the variance formulae in Iacus et al. (2011). A bias correction technique is proposed, and we apply the proposed methodology to data from two well-known observational studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2301.00889</p></details> |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks as Privacy Tools: Reliability, Disparity and Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13972v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) pose a significant threat to the privacy of machine learning models and are widely used as tools for privacy assessment, auditing, and machine unlearning. While prior MIA research has primarily focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, To appear at ACM CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[HyperGaussians: High-Dimensional Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Animatable Face Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02803v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gserifi.github.io/HyperGaussians</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Simplex: 2-Simplicial Attention in Triton](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02754v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize token efficiency. In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics, coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that $2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, with appendix 25 pages</p></details> |
| **[RIS-Aided Cooperative ISAC Networks for Structural Health Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02731v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key feature of future cellular systems, enabling applications such as intruder detection, monitoring, and tracking using the same infrastructure. However, its potential for structural health monitoring (SHM), which requires the detection of slow and subtle structural changes, remains largely unexplored due to challenges such as multipath interference and the need for ultra-high sensing precision. This study introduces a novel theoretical framework for SHM via ISAC by leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) as reference points in collaboration with base stations and users. By dynamically adjusting RIS phases to generate distinct radio signals that suppress background multipath interference, measurement accuracy at these reference points is enhanced. We theoretically analyze RIS-aided collaborative sensing in three-dimensional cellular networks using Fisher information theory, demonstrating how increasing observation time, incorporating additional receivers (even with self-positioning errors), optimizing RIS phases, and refining collaborative node selection can reduce the position error bound to meet SHM's stringent accuracy requirements. Furthermore, we develop a Bayesian inference model to identify structural states and validate damage detection probabilities. Both theoretical and numerical analyses confirm ISAC's capability for millimeter-level deformation detection, highlighting its potential for high-precision SHM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[RLHGNN: Reinforcement Learning-driven Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Next Activity Prediction in Business Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02690v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The source code is available at https://github.com/Joker3993/RLHGNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency, while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[HOI-Dyn: Learning Interaction Dynamics for Human-Object Motion Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01737v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently, resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training, preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the quality of generated interactions.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[AIGI-Holmes: Towards Explainable and Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02664v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has led to the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Think How to Think: Mitigating Overthinking with Autonomous Difficulty Cognition in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02663v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels) like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges: Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40% on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g., reflection).</p></details> | 21 pages, 18 figures |
| **[A Practical SAFE-AI Framework for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Developing Medical Artificial Intelligence Ethics Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01304v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) offers incredible possibilities for patient care, but raises significant ethical issues, such as the potential for bias. Powerful ethical frameworks exist to minimize these issues, but are often developed for academic or regulatory environments and tend to be comprehensive but overly prescriptive, making them difficult to operationalize within fast-paced, resource-constrained environments. We introduce the Scalable Agile Framework for Execution in AI (SAFE-AI) designed to balance ethical rigor with business priorities by embedding ethical oversight into standard Agile-based product development workflows. The framework emphasizes the early establishment of testable acceptance criteria, fairness metrics, and transparency metrics to manage model uncertainty, while also promoting continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of these metrics across the AI lifecycle. A core component of this framework are responsibility metrics using scenario-based probability analogy mapping designed to enhance transparency and stakeholder trust. This ensures that retraining or tuning activities are subject to lightweight but meaningful ethical review. By focusing on the minimum necessary requirements for responsible development, our framework offers a scalable, business-aligned approach to ethical AI suitable for organizations without dedicated ethics teams.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, two figures</p></details> |
| **[A Matrix Variational Auto-Encoder for Variant Effect Prediction in Pharmacogenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02624v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variant effect predictors (VEPs) aim to assess the functional impact of protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work, we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.</p></details> | 12+8 pages |

It distributes the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose \textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared to baselines.

Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall.

We extend them with a trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy trade-off.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 Figures |

Conditional generative models depend heavily on expensive annotated training data. Meanwhile, recent frameworks, which leverage pre-trained vision-language models, are limited by either per text-prompt optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. In this work, we propose a novel framework named \textit{DeltaEdit} to address these problems. Our key idea is to investigate and identify a space, namely delta image and text space that has well-aligned distribution between CLIP visual feature differences of two images and CLIP textual embedding differences of source and target texts. Based on the CLIP delta space, the DeltaEdit network is designed to map the CLIP visual features differences to the editing directions of StyleGAN at training phase. Then, in inference phase, DeltaEdit predicts the StyleGAN's editing directions from the differences of the CLIP textual features. In this way, DeltaEdit is trained in a text-free manner. Once trained, it can well generalize to various text prompts for zero-shot inference without bells and whistles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/Yueming6568/DeltaEdit</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate how existing approaches perform in this challenging scenario and propose a frequency-temporal recurrent neural network (FTRNN) that effectively bridges this gap. Our FTRNN employs a full-band module to model frequency dependencies within each time frame and a sub-band module that models temporal patterns in each frequency band. Despite being trained on short fixed-length segments of 10 s, our model demonstrates robust separation when processing signals significantly longer than training segments (21-121 s) and preserves speaker association across utterance gaps exceeding those seen during training. Unlike the conventional segment-separation-stitch paradigm, our lightweight approach (0.9 M parameters) performs inference on long audio without segmentation, eliminating segment boundary distortions while simplifying deployment. Experimental results demonstrate the generalization ability of FTRNN for multi-utterance speech separation and speaker association.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by WASPAA 2025</p></details> |

This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are with Institute of Artificial Intelligence (TeleAI), China Telecom, China.

| **[Flow Matching on Lie Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00494v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow Matching (FM) is a recent generative modelling technique: we aim to learn how to sample from distribution $\mathfrak{X}_1$ by flowing samples from some distribution $\mathfrak{X}_0$ that is easy to sample from. The key trick is that this flow field can be trained while conditioning on the end point in $\mathfrak{X}_1$: given an end point, simply move along a straight line segment to the end point (Lipman et al. 2022). However, straight line segments are only well-defined on Euclidean space. Consequently, Chen and Lipman (2023) generalised the method to FM on Riemannian manifolds, replacing line segments with geodesics or their spectral approximations. We take an alternative point of view: we generalise to FM on Lie groups by instead substituting exponential curves for line segments. This leads to a simple, intrinsic, and fast implementation for many matrix Lie groups, since the required Lie group operations (products, inverses, exponentials, logarithms) are simply given by the corresponding matrix operations. FM on Lie groups could then be used for generative modelling with data consisting of sets of features (in $\mathbb{R}^n$) and poses (in some Lie group), e.g. the latent codes of Equivariant Neural Fields (Wessels et al. 2025).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 7th International Conference on Geometric Science of Information</p></details> |

We introduce a novel pseudolikelihood-based graphical model framework that reparameterizes the target precision matrix while preserving the sparsity pattern and estimates it by minimizing an $\ell_1$-penalized empirical risk based on a new loss function. The proposed estimator maintains estimation and selection consistency in various metrics under high-dimensional assumptions. The associated optimization problem allows for a provably fast computation algorithm using a novel operator-splitting approach and communication-avoiding distributed matrix multiplication. A high-performance computing implementation of our framework was tested using simulated data with up to one million variables, demonstrating complex dependency structures similar to those found in biological networks. Leveraging this scalability, we estimated a partial correlation network from a dual-omic liver cancer data set. The co-expression network estimated from the ultrahigh-dimensional data demonstrated superior specificity in prioritizing key transcription factors and co-activators by excluding the impact of epigenetic regulation, thereby highlighting the value of computational scalability in multi-omic data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Variational Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02466v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary (short paper) version presented at ComBayNS Workshop at IJCNN'25</p></details> |
| **[Quantum-enhanced causal discovery for a small number of samples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05007v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying systems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with nonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any assumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional independence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal relations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures, demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment (KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical algorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was validated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and biological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional approaches have shown significant limitations.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time. AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation (BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them suitable for attention mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ROBOT'2025</p></details> |

A key bottleneck stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[Improving Consistency in Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Through Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02406v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios, they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess computational requirements at inference time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |
| **[PosDiffAE: Position-aware Diffusion Auto-encoder For High-Resolution Brain Tissue Classification Incorporating Artifact Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02405v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising diffusion models produce high-fidelity image samples by capturing the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation, which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the representations to regress positional information of the patches from high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (Early Access Available) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989734</p></details> |
| **[Fast reconstruction approaches for photoacoustic tomography with smoothing Sobolev/Matérn priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02401v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In photoacoustic tomography (PAT), the computation of the initial pressure distribution within an object from its time-dependent boundary measurements over time is considered. This problem can be approached from two well-established points of view: deterministically using regularisation methods, or stochastically using the Bayesian framework. Both approaches frequently require the solution of a variational problem. In the paper we elaborate the connection between these approaches by establishing the equivalence between a smoothing Mat{\'e}rn class of covariance operators and Sobolev embedding operator $E_s: H^s \hookrightarrow L^2$. We further discuss the use of a Wavelet-based implementation of the adjoint operator $E_s^*$ which also allows for efficient evaluations for certain Mat{\'e}rn covariance operators, leading to efficient implementations both in terms of computational effort as well as memory requirements. The proposed methods are validated with reconstructions for the photoacoustic problem.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Token Prepending: A Training-Free Approach for Eliciting Better Sentence Embeddings from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11556v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACL 2025 (Oral).

| **[MAGIC: Mask-Guided Diffusion Inpainting with Multi-Level Perturbations and Context-Aware Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02314v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Flow-CDNet: A Novel Network for Detecting Both Slow and Fast Changes in Bitemporal Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02307v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection typically involves identifying regions with changes between bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change, a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing RLHF (or RLVR) frameworks commonly face challenges such as inference bottlenecks and complexity barriers, restricting their accessibility for newcomers. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{OpenRLHF}, a user-friendly, scalable, and easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure, and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior training efficiency with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different model sizes compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while requiring significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.</p></details> | fix typo |

However, existing methods apply fixed processing based on a reference track, limiting users' ability to fine-tune the results to match their artistic intent. In this paper, we introduce the ITO-Master framework, a reference-based mastering style transfer system that integrates Inference-Time Optimization (ITO) to enable finer user control over the mastering process. By optimizing the reference embedding during inference, our approach allows users to refine the output dynamically, making micro-level adjustments to achieve more precise mastering results. We explore both black-box and white-box methods for modeling mastering processors and demonstrate that ITO improves mastering performance across different styles. Through objective evaluation, subjective listening tests, and qualitative analysis using text-based conditioning with CLAP embeddings, we validate that ITO enhances mastering style similarity while offering increased adaptability. Our framework provides an effective and user-controllable solution for mastering style transfer, allowing users to refine their results beyond the initial style transfer.</p></details> | ISMIR 2025 |

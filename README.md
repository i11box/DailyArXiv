| **[PyVision: Agentic Vision with Dynamic Tooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07998v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning, reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive, multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks. Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini. These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 Pa...</summary><p>26 Pages, 10 Figures, Technical report</p></details> |
| **[Skip a Layer or Loop it? Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa, suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Multigranular Evaluation for Brain Visual Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07993v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks, anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models, enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework. Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://weihaox.github.io/BASIC</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Granular Spatio-Temporal Token Merging for Training-Free Acceleration of Video LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07990v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video.

| **[Operationalizing a Threat Model for Red-Teaming Large Language Models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14937v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating secure and resilient applications with large language models (LLM) requires anticipating, adjusting to, and countering unforeseen threats. Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trans...</summary><p>Transactions of Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Automating Expert-Level Medical Reasoning Evaluation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07988v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential. However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall, MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical practice.</p></details> | 22 pages,6 figures |
| **[OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07984v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available.

| **[E3D-Bench: A Benchmark for End-to-End 3D Geometric Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01933v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://e3dbench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Geometry Forcing: Marrying Video Diffusion and 3D Representation for Consistent World Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07982v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However, our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment, which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual quality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

| **[Martian World Models: Controllable Video Synthesis with Physically Accurate 3D Reconstructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07978v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data, synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally, camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marsgenai.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Long-Form Speech Generation with Spoken Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18603v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the generative modeling of speech over multiple minutes, a requirement for long-form multimedia generation and audio-native voice assistants. However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 (oral)</p></details> |
| **[Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between alignment objectives. To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability, ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 1st Workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025.

| **[Reinforcement Learning with Action Chunking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07969v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Scaling RL to Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07966v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are available at https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL</p></details> |
| **[Input Conditioned Layer Dropping in Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07954v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven $\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks, using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Incremental Collision Laws Based on the Bouc-Wen Model: External Forces and Corner Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07953v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the article titled "The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies" and published in the Journal of Computational and Nonlinear Dynamics, the authors studied mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies that employed two incremental collision laws based on the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis. It was shown that the models possess favorable analytical properties, and several model parameter identification studies were conducted in an attempt to validate the models. In this article, these models are augmented by taking into account the effects of external forces that are modeled as time-dependent inputs that belong to a certain function space. Furthermore, the range of the parameters under which the models possess favorable analytical properties is extended to several corner cases that were not considered in the prior publication. Finally, the previously conducted model parameter identification studies are extended, and an additional model parameter identification study is provided in an attempt to validate the ability of the augmented models to represent the effects of external forces.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, see https://gitlab.com/user9716869/EBWCM. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.08147</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Generative AI: Multi-modal LLMs, Diffusions and the Unification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14993v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Particularly, two dominant families of techniques have emerged: i) Multi-modal large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive ability for multi-modal understanding; and ii) Diffusion models exhibit remarkable multi-modal powers in terms of multi-modal generation. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of multi-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the unification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for unified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and diffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling procedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to image/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we explore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and generation. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we investigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based modeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then introduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential advantages and disadvantages. In addition, we summarize the common datasets widely used for multi-modal generative AI pretraining. Last but not least, we present several challenging future research directions which may contribute to the ongoing advancement of multi-modal generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Late Fusion Multi-task Learning for Semiparametric Inference with Nuisance Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07941v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the age of large and heterogeneous datasets, the integration of information from diverse sources is essential to improve parameter estimation. Multi-task learning offers a powerful approach by enabling simultaneous learning across related tasks. In this work, we introduce a late fusion framework for multi-task learning with semiparametric models that involve infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, focusing on applications such as heterogeneous treatment effect estimation across multiple data sources, including electronic health records from different hospitals or clinical trial data. Our framework is two-step: first, initial double machine-learning estimators are obtained through individual task learning; second, these estimators are adaptively aggregated to exploit task similarities while remaining robust to task-specific differences. In particular, the framework avoids individual level data sharing, preserving privacy. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-task learning method for nuisance parameter estimation, which further enhances parameter estimation when nuisance parameters exhibit similarity across tasks. We establish theoretical guarantees for the method, demonstrating faster convergence rates compared to individual task learning when tasks share similar parametric components. Extensive simulations and real data applications complement the theoretical findings of our work while highlight the effectiveness of our framework even in moderate sample sizes.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SAGE: A Visual Language Model for Anomaly Detection via Fact Enhancement and Entropy-aware Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07939v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning, consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses. To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation (MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under zero-shot and one-shot settings.

| **[BarcodeBERT: Transformers for Biodiversity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02401v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the global challenge of understanding and characterizing biodiversity, short species-specific genomic sequences known as DNA barcodes play a critical role, enabling fine-grained comparisons among organisms within the same kingdom of life. Although machine learning algorithms specifically designed for the analysis of DNA barcodes are becoming more popular, most existing methodologies rely on generic supervised training algorithms. We introduce BarcodeBERT, a family of models tailored to biodiversity analysis and trained exclusively on data from a reference library of 1.5M invertebrate DNA barcodes. We compared the performance of BarcodeBERT on taxonomic identification tasks against a spectrum of machine learning approaches including supervised training of classical neural architectures and fine-tuning of general DNA foundation models. Our self-supervised pretraining strategies on domain-specific data outperform fine-tuned foundation models, especially in identification tasks involving lower taxa such as genera and species. We also compared BarcodeBERT with BLAST, one of the most widely used bioinformatics tools for sequence searching, and found that our method matched BLAST's performance in species-level classification while being 55 times faster. Our analysis of masking and tokenization strategies also provides practical guidance for building customized DNA language models, emphasizing the importance of aligning model training strategies with dataset characteristics and domain knowledge.

We present KIS-S, a unified framework that combines KISim, a GPU-aware Kubernetes Inference Simulator, with KIScaler, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based autoscaler. KIScaler learns latency-aware and resource-efficient scaling policies entirely in simulation, and is directly deployed without retraining. Experiments across four traffic patterns show that KIScaler improves average reward by 75.2%, reduces P95 latency up to 6.7x over CPU baselines, and generalizes without retraining. Our work bridges the gap between reactive autoscaling and intelligent orchestration for scalable GPU-accelerated environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Parallel CPU-GPU Execution for LLM Inference on Constrained GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03296v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) for online inference is often constrained by limited GPU memory, particularly due to the growing KV cache during auto-regressive decoding. Hybrid GPU-CPU execution has emerged as a promising solution by offloading KV cache management and parts of attention computation to the CPU. However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers fail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the latency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes real-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning) which are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory pressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments. We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems relying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically dispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times of CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling overheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA T4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only schedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89% on A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid schedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in long-output settings.

| **[Meek Models Shall Inherit the Earth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07931v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past decade has seen incredible scaling of AI systems by a few companies, leading to inequality in AI model performance. This paper argues that, contrary to prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead to a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those with limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the performance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating that under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability returns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices, we argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies that can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will eventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we give several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture important capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and theoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the capability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the increasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require reexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, longer version of the paper presented at TAIG ICML 2025</p></details> |

When ML methods are responsible for making critical decisions, stakeholders often require insights into how to alter these decisions. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) have emerged as a solution, offering interpretations of opaque ML models and providing a pathway to transition from one decision to another. However, most existing CFE methods require access to the model's training dataset, few methods can handle multivariate time-series, and none of model-agnostic CFE methods can handle multivariate time-series without training datasets. These limitations can be formidable in many scenarios. In this paper, we present NTD-CFE, a novel model-agnostic CFE method based on reinforcement learning (RL) that generates CFEs when training datasets are unavailable. NTD-CFE is suitable for both static and multivariate time-series datasets with continuous and discrete features. NTD-CFE reduces the CFE search space from a multivariate time-series domain to a lower dimensional space and addresses the problem using RL. Users have the flexibility to specify non-actionable, immutable, and preferred features, as well as causal constraints. We demonstrate the performance of NTD-CFE against four baselines on several datasets and find that, despite not having access to a training dataset, NTD-CFE finds CFEs that make significantly fewer and significantly smaller changes to the input time-series. These properties make CFEs more actionable, as the magnitude of change required to alter an outcome is vastly reduced. The code is available in the supplementary material.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR 2025)</p></details> |

Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature, however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities, overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency, achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of vascular contributions to brain health.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 Pa...</summary><p>14 Pages, 8 Figures, Preliminary version of the toolbox was presented at the ISMRM 2025 Conference in Hawaii at the "Software Tools" Session</p></details> |

However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs' behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory. Furthermore, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details. These findings provide key insights for improving retrieval-augmented generation and context-aware LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/liyp0095/ContextFaithful.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published at ACL 2025</p></details> |

We leverage deep reinforcement learning to train a single locomotion policy on procedurally generated robots. The policy maps proprioceptive robot state information and base velocity commands into desired joint actuation targets, which are conditioned using a latent embedding of the temporally local system dynamics. We explore two conditioning strategies - one using a GRU-based dynamics encoder and another using a morphology-based property estimator - and show that morphology-aware conditioning outperforms temporal dynamics encoding regarding velocity task tracking for our hardware test on ANYmal C. Our results demonstrate that both approaches achieve robust zero-shot transfer across multiple unseen simulated quadrupeds. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for careful robot reference modelling during training: exposing the policy to a diverse set of robot morphologies and dynamics leads to improved generalization, reducing the velocity tracking error by up to 30% compared to the baseline method. Despite PAL not surpassing the best-performing reference-free controller in all cases, our analysis uncovers critical design choices and informs improvements to the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

This study examines the role of olfactory stimuli in enhancing these effects, using a randomized within-subject design. Thirty participants aged 18-60 experienced VR scenarios simulating a calming seaside environment, with sessions lasting 45 minutes, in two conditions: with and without a "Beach" essential oil scent (Yankee Candle) administered via diffuser. Stress and relaxation were assessed through self-reported surveys and physiological measures, specifically ECG-based heart rate variability (HRV). Results showed no significant difference in self-reported relaxation scores (p=0.371) between conditions, but HRV analysis revealed a significant stress reduction (p=0.002) with olfactory input, with HF increasing 108% from the Math Stress Test to the scented relaxation condition, compared to 44% without scent. Additionally, 71.4% of participants expressed willingness to use olfactory-enhanced VR for relaxation, suggesting practical appeal. These findings indicate that olfactory stimuli may enhance relaxation subconsciously, underscoring the importance of multisensory integration in VR. Future work could explore personalized scents and long-term effects to optimize VR- based interventions for emotional and physical well-being.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Medical Measurements & Applications (MeMeA) 2025</p></details> |

Existing dynamic topic modeling techniques, while powerful, often exist in fragmented pipelines that lack robust support for interpretation and user-friendly exploration. We introduce DTECT (Dynamic Topic Explorer & Context Tracker), an end-to-end system that bridges the gap between raw textual data and meaningful temporal insights. DTECT provides a unified workflow that supports data preprocessing, multiple model architectures, and dedicated evaluation metrics to analyze the topic quality of temporal topic models. It significantly enhances interpretability by introducing LLM-driven automatic topic labeling, trend analysis via temporally salient words, interactive visualizations with document-level summarization, and a natural language chat interface for intuitive data querying.

| **[A statistical physics framework for optimal learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07907v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning is a complex dynamical process shaped by a range of interconnected decisions. Careful design of hyperparameter schedules for artificial neural networks or efficient allocation of cognitive resources by biological learners can dramatically affect performance. Yet, theoretical understanding of optimal learning strategies remains sparse, especially due to the intricate interplay between evolving meta-parameters and nonlinear learning dynamics. The search for optimal protocols is further hindered by the high dimensionality of the learning space, often resulting in predominantly heuristic, difficult to interpret, and computationally demanding solutions. Here, we combine statistical physics with control theory in a unified theoretical framework to identify optimal protocols in prototypical neural network models. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive closed-form ordinary differential equations that track online stochastic gradient descent through low-dimensional order parameters. We formulate the design of learning protocols as an optimal control problem directly on the dynamics of the order parameters with the goal of minimizing the generalization error at the end of training. This framework encompasses a variety of learning scenarios, optimization constraints, and control budgets. We apply it to representative cases, including optimal curricula, adaptive dropout regularization and noise schedules in denoising autoencoders. We find nontrivial yet interpretable strategies highlighting how optimal protocols mediate crucial learning tradeoffs, such as maximizing alignment with informative input directions while minimizing noise fitting. Finally, we show how to apply our framework to real datasets. Our results establish a principled foundation for understanding and designing optimal learning protocols and suggest a path toward a theory of meta-learning grounded in statistical physics.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 figures |

In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a visual odometry task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the DSD 2025 conference in Salerno, Italy</p></details> |

However, intensive coordination among distributed BSs within the ISAC-enabled network poses risks of generating substantial interference to other coexisting networks sharing the same spectrum, while also incurring elevated costs from energy consumption and signaling exchange. To address these challenges, this paper develops an interference-suppressed and cost-efficient cell-free ISAC network, which opportunistically and cooperatively orchestrates distributed radio resources to accommodate the competing demands of sensing and communication (S\&C) services. Specifically, we conceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that autonomously suppresses interference across the entire signal propagation space to safeguard other networks without exchanging channel knowledge signaling. Then, we propose joint BS activation and beamforming coordination to dynamically activate appropriate BSs and orchestrate their spatial beams for service provisioning. Building upon this framework, we formulate a cost-efficient utility maximization problem that considers individual S\&C demands and location-dependent radiation footprint constraints. Since this results in a non-convex optimization problem, we develop a monotonic optimization embedded branch-and-bound (MO-BRB) algorithm to find the optimal solution. Additionally, we apply a low-complexity iterative method to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

A Case Study in Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01788v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, these models face significant limitations in legal dispute analysis, including insufficient legal knowledge representation, limited concept understanding, and reasoning deficiencies. This research proposes an enhanced framework integrating prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge graphs. The framework introduces a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure comprising task definition, knowledge background, and reasoning guidance, supplemented by legal-specific reasoning templates and dynamic optimization mechanisms. A three-layer knowledge graph architecture is constructed with legal classification ontology, representation, and instance layers. Four complementary methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct legal norm code matching, domain-specific semantic vector similarity, ontology-based path reasoning, and specialized lexical segmentation. These components integrate with web search technology to establish a knowledge-enhanced framework for legal decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements in legal dispute analysis, enabling accurate legal application analysis for complex cases while exhibiting nuanced understanding of judicial decision-making logic, providing a novel technical approach for implementing intelligent legal assistance systems.</p></details> | 15 pages,3 figures |

In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at: https://github.com/ShivamDuggal4/karl Keywords: Representation Learning, Adaptive Tokenization, Compression, Algorithmic Information Theory, Kolmogorov Complexity, Upside-Down RL</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a 2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same video.

However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 (oral)</p></details> |

Data is encrypted not only during rest and transit, but also during processing. However, FHE provides a limited instruction set: SIMD addition, SIMD multiplication, and cyclic rotation of 1-D vectors. This restriction makes performing multi-dimensional tensor operations challenging. Practitioners must pack these tensors into 1-D vectors and map tensor operations onto this one-dimensional layout rather than their traditional nested structure. And while prior systems have made significant strides in automating this process, they often hide critical packing decisions behind layers of abstraction, making debugging, optimizing, and building on top of these systems difficult. In this work, we approach multi-dimensional tensor operations in FHE through Einstein summation (einsum) notation. Einsum notation explicitly encodes dimensional structure and operations in its syntax, naturally exposing how tensors should be packed and transformed. We decompose einsum expressions into a fixed set of FHE-friendly operations. We implement our design and present EinHops, a minimalist system that factors einsum expressions into a fixed sequence of FHE operations. EinHops enables developers to perform encrypted tensor operations using FHE while maintaining full visibility into the underlying packing strategy. We evaluate EinHops on a range of tensor operations from a simple transpose to complex multi-dimensional contractions. We show that the explicit nature of einsum notation allows us to build an FHE tensor system that is simple, general, and interpretable. We open-source EinHops at the following repository: https://github.com/baahl-nyu/einhops.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

One emerging approach is layer dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven $\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks, using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025</p></details> |

Although machine learning algorithms specifically designed for the analysis of DNA barcodes are becoming more popular, most existing methodologies rely on generic supervised training algorithms. We introduce BarcodeBERT, a family of models tailored to biodiversity analysis and trained exclusively on data from a reference library of 1.5M invertebrate DNA barcodes. We compared the performance of BarcodeBERT on taxonomic identification tasks against a spectrum of machine learning approaches including supervised training of classical neural architectures and fine-tuning of general DNA foundation models. Our self-supervised pretraining strategies on domain-specific data outperform fine-tuned foundation models, especially in identification tasks involving lower taxa such as genera and species. We also compared BarcodeBERT with BLAST, one of the most widely used bioinformatics tools for sequence searching, and found that our method matched BLAST's performance in species-level classification while being 55 times faster. Our analysis of masking and tokenization strategies also provides practical guidance for building customized DNA language models, emphasizing the importance of aligning model training strategies with dataset characteristics and domain knowledge.

In particular, it is unclear whether the representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example, unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over 60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.</p></details> | 9 pages |

While compatible with low-power microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization. It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and 27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SenSys 2026 on July 1, 2025</p></details> |

At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by expected value and variance. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</p></details> | 9 pages,1 figures |

In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as ToDMA, where a large number of devices share a tokenizer and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, the source signal is tokenized into sequences, with each token modulated into a codeword. Codewords from multiple devices are transmitted simultaneously, resulting in overlap at the receiver. The receiver detects the transmitted tokens, assigns them to their respective sources, and mitigates token collisions by leveraging context and semantic orthogonality across the devices' messages. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed ToDMA framework outperforms context-unaware orthogonal and non-orthogonal communication methods in image transmission tasks, achieving lower latency and better image quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the IEEE INFOCOM Workshops 2025</p></details> |

However, a key limitation is that most are trained to maximize reconstruction fidelity, often neglecting the specific latent structure necessary for optimal performance in diverse downstream applications. We propose a simple, post-hoc framework to address this by modifying the bottleneck of a pre-trained autoencoder. Our method introduces a "Re-Bottleneck", an inner bottleneck trained exclusively through latent space losses to instill user-defined structure. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in three experiments. First, we enforce an ordering on latent channels without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Second, we align latents with semantic embeddings, analyzing the impact on downstream diffusion modeling. Third, we introduce equivariance, ensuring that a filtering operation on the input waveform directly corresponds to a specific transformation in the latent space. Ultimately, our Re-Bottleneck framework offers a flexible and efficient way to tailor representations of neural audio models, enabling them to seamlessly meet the varied demands of different applications with minimal additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07831v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, model creation usually relies on laborious manual transformation of the unstructured point cloud data provided by laser scans or photogrammetry. This paper presents Cloud2BIM, an open-source software tool designed to automate the conversion of point clouds into BIM models compliant with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. Cloud2BIM integrates advanced algorithms for wall and slab segmentation, opening detection, and room zoning based on real wall surfaces, resulting in a comprehensive and fully automated workflow. Unlike existing tools, it avoids computationally- and calibration-intensive techniques such as RANSAC, supports non-orthogonal geometries, and provides unprecedented processing speed-achieving results up to seven times faster than fastest competing solutions. Systematic validation using benchmark datasets confirms that Cloud2BIM is an easy-to-use, efficient, and scalable solution for generating accurate BIM models, capable of converting extensive point cloud datasets for entire buildings into IFC format with minimal user input.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published version, 23 pages, 25 figures</p></details> |

With $M$ points in the spatial discretization and $N_t$ time steps of size $\Delta t$, a naive implementation would require $\mathcal O(M^2N_t^2)$ work in dimensions where the weak Huygens' principle applies. We avoid this all-to-all interaction using a smoothly windowed decomposition into a local part, treated directly, plus a history part, approximated by a $N_F$-term Fourier series. In one dimension, our method requires $\mathcal O\left((M + N_F \log N_F)N_t\right)$ work, with $N_F =\mathcal O(1/\Delta t)$, by exploiting the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. We demonstrate the method's performance for time-domain scattering problems involving a large number $M$ of springs (point scatterers) attached to a vibrating string at arbitrary locations, with either periodic or free-space boundary conditions. We typically achieve 10-digit accuracy, and include tests for $M$ up to a million.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Bridging Logic and Learning: Decoding Temporal Logic Embeddings via Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07808v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible. We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in the semantic space.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, to be published in ECML-PKDD</p></details> |
| **[Non-conjugate variational Bayes for pseudo-likelihood mixed effect models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09444v4)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a unified, yet simple to code, non-conjugate variational Bayes algorithm for posterior approximation of generic Bayesian generalized mixed effect models. Specifically, we consider regression models identified by a linear predictor, eventually transformed using a bijective link, where the prediction misfit is measured using, possibly non-differentiable, loss functions. Examples include generalized linear models, quasi-likelihood models, and robust regression. To address the limitations of non-conjugate settings, we employ an efficient message passing optimization strategy under a Gaussian variational approximation of the posterior. The resulting algorithms automatically account for non-conjugate priors and non-smooth losses, without requiring model-specific data-augmented representations. Besides the general formulation, we provide closed-form updates for popular model specifications, including quantile regression and support vector machines. Overall, theoretical and empirical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its computational efficiency and approximation accuracy as an alternative to existing Bayesian techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[SVIP: Semantically Contextualized Visual Patches for Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10252v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes without labeled training examples by leveraging class-level semantic descriptors such as attributes. A fundamental challenge in ZSL is semantic misalignment, where semantic-unrelated information involved in visual features introduce ambiguity to visual-semantic interaction. Unlike existing methods that suppress semantic-unrelated information post hoc either in the feature space or the model space, we propose addressing this issue at the input stage, preventing semantic-unrelated patches from propagating through the network. To this end, we introduce Semantically contextualized VIsual Patches (SVIP) for ZSL, a transformer-based framework designed to enhance visual-semantic alignment. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised patch selection mechanism that preemptively learns to identify semantic-unrelated patches in the input space. This is trained with the supervision from aggregated attention scores across all transformer layers, which estimate each patch's semantic score. As removing semantic-unrelated patches from the input sequence may disrupt object structure, we replace them with learnable patch embeddings. With initialization from word embeddings, we can ensure they remain semantically meaningful throughout feature extraction. Extensive experiments on ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that SVIP achieves state-of-the-art performance results while providing more interpretable and semantically rich feature representations.

| **[SAS: Simulated Attention Score](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07694v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture. Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings, enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different attention variants.</p></details> | Tech Report |

This work investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering (QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5 families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%. Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD, combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems suitable for resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted four publication at the 26th Meeting of the Special Interest on Discourse and Dialogue</p></details> |
| **[TransformEEG: Towards Improving Model Generalizability in Deep Learning-based EEG Parkinson's Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07622v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important, low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns within the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor generalizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high variability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by developing new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces TransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's disease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet structure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This tokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific features, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention layers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public datasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were harmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out (N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison against seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG achieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest interquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined with data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to 80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG produces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial reduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared to the other investigated models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible publication.

However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy, ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

Tor\'an and W\"orz (TOCL 2023) showed that there is a resolution refutation of narrow width $k$ for two graphs if and only if they can be distinguished in ($k+1$)-variable first-order logic (FO$^{k+1}$) and hence by a count-free variant of the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm. While DAG-like narrow width $k$ resolution refutations have size at most $n^k$, tree-like refutations may be much larger. We show that there are graphs of order n, whose isomorphism can be refuted in narrow width $k$ but only in tree-like size $2^{\Omega(n^{k/2})}$. This is a supercritical trade-off where bounding one parameter (the narrow width) causes the other parameter (the size) to grow above its worst case. The size lower bound is super-exponential in the formula size and improves a related supercritical width versus tree-like size trade-off by Razborov (JACM 2016). To prove our result, we develop a new variant of the $k$-pebble EF-game for FO$^k$ to reason about tree-like refutation size in a similar way as the Prover-Delayer games in proof complexity. We analyze this game on a modified variant of the compressed CFI graphs introduced by Grohe, Lichter, Neuen, and Schweitzer (FOCS 2023). Using a recent improved robust compressed CFI construction of Janett, Nordstr\"om, and Pang (unpublished manuscript), we obtain a similar bound for width $k$ (instead of the stronger but less common narrow width) and make the result more robust.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 2 figures, full version of a paper accepted for publication at MFCS 2025</p></details> |

To enlarge the training data, model-based offline RL learns a dynamics model which is utilized as a virtual environment to generate simulation data and enhance policy learning. However, existing data augmentation methods for offline RL suffer from (i) trivial improvement from short-horizon simulation; and (ii) the lack of evaluation and correction for generated data, leading to low-qualified augmentation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory optimization for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). The key motivation is to conduct long-horizon simulation and then utilize model uncertainty to evaluate and correct the augmented data. Specifically, we propose an ensemble of Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict environment state dynamics and the reward function. Three strategies are proposed to use World Transformers to generate long-horizon trajectory simulation by perturbing the actions in the offline data. Then, an uncertainty-based World Evaluator is introduced to firstly evaluate the confidence of the generated trajectories and then perform the correction for low-confidence data. Finally, we jointly use the original data with the corrected augmentation data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing model-free offline RL methods. Experiments on various benchmarks show that OTTO can effectively improve the performance of representative offline RL algorithms, including in complex environments with sparse rewards like AntMaze.

Prototype learning methods in MIS focus on generating segmentation masks through pixel-to-prototype comparison. However, current approaches often overlook sample diversity by using a fixed prototype per semantic class and neglect intra-class variation within each input. In this paper, we propose to generate instance-adaptive prototypes for MIS, which integrates a common prototype proposal (CPP) capturing common visual patterns and an instance-specific prototype proposal (IPP) tailored to each input. To further account for the intra-class variation, we propose to guide the IPP generation by re-weighting the intermediate feature map according to their confidence scores. These confidence scores are hierarchically generated using a transformer decoder. Additionally we introduce a novel self-supervised filtering strategy to prioritize the foreground pixels during the training of the transformer decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches by both normalizing channels activations and applying Hadamard transforms to effectively mitigate outliers and enable aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 6 Figures |

This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity, concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities, marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference.

This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their parameterized knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers \textit{outperform} previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on their reasoning capability. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose TEGA, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Extracting ORR Catalyst Information for Fuel Cell from Scientific Literature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07499v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++ with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT, to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature, which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics (FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12 critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%. Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT for ORR catalyst extraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps, which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer, as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological correspondences.

While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by iccv 2025. code is will be available at https://github.com/rama0126/PwTF-DVD</p></details> |

To realize this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments. These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.06756</p></details> |

Test-Time Depth Adaptation of Pretrained LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07996v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can a pretrained neural network adapt its architecture to different inputs without any finetuning? Do we need all layers for simple tasks, and are they adequate for challenging tasks? We found that the layers of a pretrained large language model (LLM) can be manipulated as separate modules to build a better and even shallower model customized for each test sample. In particular, each layer from the pretrained model can be skipped/pruned or repeated multiple times as recurrent neural networks (RNN), and stacked with others in arbitrary orders, yielding a chain-of-layers (CoLa) per sample. This compositional space greatly expands the scope of existing works on looped/recurrent pretrained modules, layer pruning, or early-exit networks. We develop a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) protocol to explore and identify the optimal CoLa for each sample from math and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Compared to a static model of a fixed depth, CoLa allows shortcut paths (fast thinking), recurrence of the same layer(s) (slow thinking), and combining both, offering more flexible, dynamic architectures for different inputs. We conduct an extensive analysis of the MCTS-optimized CoLa, which leads to two key findings: (1) For >75% of samples with correct predictions by the original LLM, we can find shorter CoLa, suggesting a large space for improving inference efficiency; (2) For >60% of samples with originally incorrect predictions, we can identify CoLa achieving correct predictions, suggesting a large space of performance enhancement. Our results highlight the shortcomings of using a fixed architecture of pre-trained LLMs for inference on different samples and pave the way to unlock the generalization power of test-time depth adaptation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

However, textless spoken language models struggle to generate plausible speech past tens of seconds, due to high temporal resolution of speech tokens causing loss of coherence, architectural issues with long-sequence training or extrapolation, and memory costs at inference time. From these considerations we derive SpeechSSM, the first speech language model family to learn from and sample long-form spoken audio (e.g., 16 minutes of read or extemporaneous speech) in a single decoding session without text intermediates. SpeechSSMs leverage recent advances in linear-time sequence modeling to greatly surpass current Transformer spoken LMs in coherence and efficiency on multi-minute generations while still matching them at the utterance level. As we found current spoken language evaluations uninformative, especially in this new long-form setting, we also introduce: LibriSpeech-Long, a benchmark for long-form speech evaluation; new embedding-based and LLM-judged metrics; and quality measurements over length and time. Speech samples, the LibriSpeech-Long dataset, and any future code or model releases can be found at https://google.github.io/tacotron/publications/speechssm/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025 (oral)</p></details> |
| **[Watermarking Degrades Alignment in Language Models: Analysis and Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04462v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between alignment objectives. To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability, ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 1st Workshop on GenAI Watermarking, collocated with ICLR 2025.

| **[Input Conditioned Layer Dropping in Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07954v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven $\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks, using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Late Fusion Multi-task Learning for Semiparametric Inference with Nuisance Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07941v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the age of large and heterogeneous datasets, the integration of information from diverse sources is essential to improve parameter estimation. Multi-task learning offers a powerful approach by enabling simultaneous learning across related tasks. In this work, we introduce a late fusion framework for multi-task learning with semiparametric models that involve infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, focusing on applications such as heterogeneous treatment effect estimation across multiple data sources, including electronic health records from different hospitals or clinical trial data. Our framework is two-step: first, initial double machine-learning estimators are obtained through individual task learning; second, these estimators are adaptively aggregated to exploit task similarities while remaining robust to task-specific differences. In particular, the framework avoids individual level data sharing, preserving privacy. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-task learning method for nuisance parameter estimation, which further enhances parameter estimation when nuisance parameters exhibit similarity across tasks. We establish theoretical guarantees for the method, demonstrating faster convergence rates compared to individual task learning when tasks share similar parametric components. Extensive simulations and real data applications complement the theoretical findings of our work while highlight the effectiveness of our framework even in moderate sample sizes.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |

We present KIS-S, a unified framework that combines KISim, a GPU-aware Kubernetes Inference Simulator, with KIScaler, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based autoscaler. KIScaler learns latency-aware and resource-efficient scaling policies entirely in simulation, and is directly deployed without retraining. Experiments across four traffic patterns show that KIScaler improves average reward by 75.2%, reduces P95 latency up to 6.7x over CPU baselines, and generalizes without retraining. Our work bridges the gap between reactive autoscaling and intelligent orchestration for scalable GPU-accelerated environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Parallel CPU-GPU Execution for LLM Inference on Constrained GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03296v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) for online inference is often constrained by limited GPU memory, particularly due to the growing KV cache during auto-regressive decoding. Hybrid GPU-CPU execution has emerged as a promising solution by offloading KV cache management and parts of attention computation to the CPU. However, a key bottleneck remains: existing schedulers fail to effectively overlap CPU-offloaded tasks with GPU execution during the latency-critical, bandwidth-bound decode phase. This particularly penalizes real-time, decode-heavy applications (e.g., chat, Chain-of-Thought reasoning) which are currently underserved by existing systems, especially under memory pressure typical of edge or low-cost deployments. We present APEX, a novel, profiling-informed scheduling strategy that maximizes CPU-GPU parallelism during hybrid LLM inference. Unlike systems relying on static rules or purely heuristic approaches, APEX dynamically dispatches compute across heterogeneous resources by predicting execution times of CPU and GPU subtasks to maximize overlap while avoiding scheduling overheads. We evaluate APEX on diverse workloads and GPU architectures (NVIDIA T4, A10), using LLaMa-2-7B and LLaMa-3.1-8B models. Compared to GPU-only schedulers like VLLM, APEX improves throughput by 84% - 96% on T4 and 11% - 89% on A10 GPUs, while preserving latency. Against the best existing hybrid schedulers, it delivers up to 49% (T4) and 37% (A10) higher throughput in long-output settings. APEX significantly advances hybrid LLM inference efficiency on such memory-constrained hardware and provides a blueprint for scheduling in heterogeneous AI systems, filling a critical gap for efficient real-time LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

The coefficient is derived for bivariate normal and elliptically contoured distributions, showcasing its versatility. In the case of normal distributions, rho1 is linked to Lin's coefficient, providing a useful alternative. The paper includes theoretical properties, an inference framework, and numerical experiments to validate the performance of rho1. This novel coefficient presents a valuable tool for researchers assessing agreement between continuous variables in various fields, including clinical studies and spatial analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

| **[UnIT: Scalable Unstructured Inference-Time Pruning for MAC-efficient Neural Inference on MCUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07885v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing pruning methods are typically applied during training or compile time and often rely on structured sparsity. While compatible with low-power microcontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for fine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To address these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time pruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips unnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by input-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces irregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization. It transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing multiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further optimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections and applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three fast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of common embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT achieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and 27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned models, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%. Under domain shift, UnIT matches or exceeds the accuracy of retrained models while requiring significantly fewer MACs. These results establish unstructured inference-time pruning as a viable and practical solution for efficient, retraining-free deployment of deep neural networks on MCUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SenSys 2026 on July 1, 2025</p></details> |

While differential privacy (DP) mitigates these risks, it has limitations including limited resolution in expressing privacy-utility tradeoffs and intractable sensitivity calculations for tight guarantees. We propose a game-theoretic framework modeling privacy protection as a Bayesian game between defender and attacker, where privacy loss corresponds to the attacker's membership inference ability. To address strategic complexity, we represent the defender's mixed strategy as a neural network generator mapping private datasets to public representations (e.g., noisy statistics) and the attacker's strategy as a discriminator making membership claims. This \textit{general-sum Generative Adversarial Network} trains iteratively through alternating updates, yielding \textit{Bayes-Nash Generative Privacy (BNGP)} strategies. BNGP avoids worst-case privacy proofs such as sensitivity calculations, supports correlated mechanism compositions, handles heterogeneous attacker preferences. Empirical studies on sensitive dataset summary statistics show our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating stronger attacks and achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.01811</p></details> |

Multiple methods recover such directions and build probes that are described as uncovering a model's "knowledge" or "beliefs". We investigate this phenomenon, looking closely at the impact of context on the probes. Our experiments establish where in the LLM the probe's predictions are (most) sensitive to the presence of related sentences, and how to best characterize this kind of sensitivity. We do so by measuring different types of consistency errors that occur after probing an LLM whose inputs consist of hypotheses preceded by (negated) supporting and contradicting sentences. We also perform a causal intervention experiment, investigating whether moving the representation of a premise along these truth-value directions influences the position of an entailed or contradicted sentence along that same direction. We find that the probes we test are generally context sensitive, but that contexts which should not affect the truth often still impact the probe outputs. Our experiments show that the type of errors depend on the layer, the model, and the kind of data. Finally, our results suggest that truth-value directions are causal mediators in the inference process that incorporates in-context information.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |

Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics modeling to capture the dynamics of the load. We integrate this proposed modeling technique and leverage recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) based locomotion control to enable the robot to infer the dynamics of load movement and interact with the load indirectly to stabilize it and realize the sim-to-real deployment to verify its effectiveness in real scenarios.

They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This, along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that, if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and coherence are secondary to effectiveness.</p></details> | Preprint |

With $M$ points in the spatial discretization and $N_t$ time steps of size $\Delta t$, a naive implementation would require $\mathcal O(M^2N_t^2)$ work in dimensions where the weak Huygens' principle applies. We avoid this all-to-all interaction using a smoothly windowed decomposition into a local part, treated directly, plus a history part, approximated by a $N_F$-term Fourier series. In one dimension, our method requires $\mathcal O\left((M + N_F \log N_F)N_t\right)$ work, with $N_F =\mathcal O(1/\Delta t)$, by exploiting the non-uniform fast Fourier transform. We demonstrate the method's performance for time-domain scattering problems involving a large number $M$ of springs (point scatterers) attached to a vibrating string at arbitrary locations, with either periodic or free-space boundary conditions. We typically achieve 10-digit accuracy, and include tests for $M$ up to a million.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |

If such embeddings are semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible. We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in the semantic space.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, to be published in ECML-PKDD</p></details> |

Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLT 2025.

However, rendering reflective objects remains a significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details. We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, SAM's architecture is designed for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage, at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Abstr...</summary><p>Abstract accepted at MIUA 2025</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology, echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical applications.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Existing deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT).

Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding (RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

PlanQA is grounded in structured representations of indoor scenes, such as kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms, encoded in a symbolic format (e.g., JSON, XML layouts). The benchmark includes diverse question types that test not only metric and topological reasoning (e.g., distance, visibility, shortest paths) but also interior design constraints such as affordance, clearance, balance, and usability. Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial LLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to simulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under layout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they do not consistently reason about real-world layouts. We hope that this benchmark inspires new work on language models that can accurately infer and manipulate spatial and geometric properties in practical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 18 figures.

The de facto approach to solving the problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering (QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics, contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small training cost (1000 examples).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML Workshop: Efficient Systems for Foundation Models</p></details> |

However, existing methods often yield suboptimal results due to the entanglement of causal-spurious features and the failure of global alignment strategies. We propose SLOGAN (Sparse Causal Discovery with Generative Intervention), a novel approach that achieves stable graph representation transfer through sparse causal modeling and dynamic intervention mechanisms. Specifically, SLOGAN first constructs a sparse causal graph structure, leveraging mutual information bottleneck constraints to disentangle sparse, stable causal features while compressing domain-dependent spurious correlations through variational inference. To address residual spurious correlations, we innovatively design a generative intervention mechanism that breaks local spurious couplings through cross-domain feature recombination while maintaining causal feature semantic consistency via covariance constraints. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation in target domain pseudo-labels, we introduce a category-adaptive dynamic calibration strategy, ensuring stable discriminative learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that SLOGAN significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Bayesian Discrete Diffusion Beats Autoregressive Perplexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07586v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite using a model of comparable size.

To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging document image scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Main</p></details> |

| **[TokenWeave: Efficient Compute-Communication Overlap for Distributed LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11329v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed inference of large language models (LLMs) can introduce overheads of up to 20% even over GPUs connected via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. Multiple techniques have been proposed to mitigate these overheads by decomposing computations into finer-grained tasks and overlapping communication with sub-tasks as they complete. However, fine-grained decomposition of a large computation into many smaller computations on GPUs results in overheads. Furthermore, the communication itself uses many streaming multiprocessors (SMs), adding to the overhead. We present TokenWeave to address these challenges. TokenWeave proposes a Token-Splitting technique that divides the tokens in the inference batch into two approximately equal subsets in a wave-aware manner. The communication of one subset is then overlapped with the computation of the other. In addition, TokenWeave optimizes the order of the layer normalization computation with respect to communication operations and implements a novel fused AllReduce--RMSNorm kernel that carefully leverages Multimem instruction support available on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs. These optimizations allow TokenWeave to perform communication and RMSNorm using only 2-8 SMs. Moreover, our kernel enables the memory-bound RMSNorm to be overlapped with the other batch's computation, providing additional gains. Our evaluations demonstrate up to 1.29x speedup in latency and 1.26x higher throughput across multiple models and workloads. In several settings, TokenWeave results in better performance compared to an equivalent model with all communication removed.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 16 figures.

| **[LARP: Learner-Agnostic Robust Data Prefiltering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20573v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread availability of large public datasets is a key factor behind the recent successes of statistical inference and machine learning methods. However, these datasets often contain some low-quality or contaminated data, to which many learning procedures are sensitive. Therefore, the question of whether and how public datasets should be prefiltered to facilitate accurate downstream learning arises. On a technical level this requires the construction of principled data prefiltering methods which are learner-agnostic robust, in the sense of provably protecting a set of pre-specified downstream learners from corrupted data. In this work, we formalize the problem of Learner-Agnostic Robust data Prefiltering (LARP), which aims at finding prefiltering procedures that minimize a worst-case loss over a pre-specified set of learners. We first instantiate our framework in the context of scalar mean estimation with Huber estimators under the Huber data contamination model. We provide a hardness result on a specific problem instance and analyze several natural prefiltering procedures. Our theoretical results indicate that performing LARP on a heterogeneous set of learners leads to some loss in model performance compared to the alternative of prefiltering data for each learner/use-case individually. We explore the resulting utility loss and its dependence on the problem parameters via extensive experiments on real-world image and tabular data, observing statistically significant reduction in utility. Finally, we model the trade-off between the utility drop and the cost of repeated (learner-specific) prefiltering within a game-theoretic framework and showcase benefits of LARP for large datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICML 2025 Workshop on DataWorld: Unifying Data Curation Frameworks Across Domains</p></details> |

Studies addressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on improving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in understanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a framework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use. AlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent representations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic composition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential methodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent search algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down hypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses via circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The rigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an alternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a principled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic explanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling comprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can in turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving performance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025 as a Spotlight Position Paper</p></details> |

Furthermore, there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; to be submitted to AAAI-26 after reviews</p></details> |

Such advantage of sampling adaptivity has been realized since Chernoff's seminal paper in 1959 [1]. While a large body of works have explored and investigated the gain of adaptivity, in the general multiple-hypothesis setting, the fundamental limits of individual error probabilities have not been fully understood. In particular, in the asymptotic regime as the expected stopping time tends to infinity, the error exponents are only characterized in specific cases, such as that of the total error probability. In this paper, we consider a general setup of active sequential multiple-hypothesis testing where at each time slot, a temporally varying subset of data sources (out of a known set) emerges from which the decision maker can select to collect samples, subject to a family of expected selection budget constraints. The selection of sources, understood as the ``action'' at each time slot, is constrained in a predefined action space. At the end of each time slot, the decision maker either decides to make the inference on the $M$ hypotheses, or continues to observe the data sources for the next time slot. The optimal tradeoffs among $M(M-1)$ types of error exponents are characterized. A companion asymptotically optimal test that strikes the balance between exploration and exploitation is proposed to achieve any target error exponents within the region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature to identify such tradeoffs among error exponents in active sequential hypothesis testing, and it uncovers the tension among different action taking policies even in the basic setting of Chernoff [1].</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

While previous work has explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit: empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms, particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy.

To address computational demands, Sequential Monte Carlo Squared (SMC$^2$) is well-suited for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. The design of the proposal distribution within SMC$^2$ can improve accuracy and exploration of the posterior as poor proposals may lead to high variance in importance weights and particle degeneracy. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) uses gradient information so that particles preferentially explore regions of higher probability. In this paper, we extend this idea by incorporating second-order information, specifically the Hessian of the log-target. While second-order proposals have been explored previously in particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (p-MCMC) methods, we are the first to introduce them within the SMC$^2$ framework. Second-order proposals not only use the gradient (first-order derivative), but also the curvature (second-order derivative) of the target distribution. Experimental results on synthetic models highlight the benefits of our approach in terms of step-size selection and posterior approximation accuracy when compared to other proposals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Machine Learning Signal Processing conference 2025</p></details> |

However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work, we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector (GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical reasoning and science problem-solving.

However, given the expensive measurements, large configuration space, and rugged configuration landscape, existing tuners suffer ineffectiveness due to the difficult balance of budget utilization between exploring uncertain regions (for escaping from local optima) and exploiting guidance of known good configurations (for fast convergence). The root cause is that we lack knowledge of where the promising regions lay, which also causes challenges in the explainability of the results. In this paper, we propose PromiseTune that tunes configuration guided by causally purified rules. PromiseTune is unique in the sense that we learn rules, which reflect certain regions in the configuration landscape, and purify them with causal inference. The remaining rules serve as approximated reflections of the promising regions, bounding the tuning to emphasize these places in the landscape. This, as we demonstrate, can effectively mitigate the impact of the exploration and exploitation trade-off. Those purified regions can then be paired with the measured configurations to provide spatial explainability at the landscape level. Comparing with 11 state-of-the-art tuners on 12 systems and varying budgets, we show that PromiseTune performs significantly better than the others with 42% superior rank to the overall second best while providing richer information to explain the hidden system characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSE26</p></details> |

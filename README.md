| **[MR. Video: "MapReduce" is the Principle for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16082v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MR. Video, an agentic long video understanding framework that demonstrates the simple yet effective MapReduce principle for processing long videos: (1) Map: independently and densely perceiving short video clips, and (2) Reduce: jointly aggregating information from all clips. Compared with sequence-to-sequence vision-language models (VLMs), MR. Video performs detailed short video perception without being limited by context length. Compared with existing video agents that typically rely on sequential key segment selection, the Map operation enables simpler and more scalable sequence parallel perception of short video segments. Its Reduce step allows for more comprehensive context aggregation and reasoning, surpassing explicit key segment retrieval. This MapReduce principle is applicable to both VLMs and video agents, and we use LLM agents to validate its effectiveness. In practice, MR. Video employs two MapReduce stages: (A) Captioning: generating captions for short video clips (map), then standardizing repeated characters and objects into shared names (reduce); (B) Analysis: for each user question, analyzing relevant information from individual short videos (map), and integrating them into a final answer (reduce). MR. Video achieves over 10% accuracy improvement on the challenging LVBench compared to state-of-the-art VLMs and video agents.

Traditionally, IRL is treated as an adversarial game, where an adversary searches over reward models, and a learner optimizes the reward through repeated RL procedures. This game-solving approach is both computationally expensive and difficult to stabilize. In this work, we propose a novel approach to IRL by direct policy optimization: exploiting a linear factorization of the return as the inner product of successor features and a reward vector, we design an IRL algorithm by policy gradient descent on the gap between the learner and expert features. Our non-adversarial method does not require learning a reward function and can be solved seamlessly with existing actor-critic RL algorithms. Remarkably, our approach works in state-only settings without expert action labels, a setting which behavior cloning (BC) cannot solve. Empirical results demonstrate that our method learns from as few as a single expert demonstration and achieves improved performance on various control tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Reflection to Perfection: Scaling Inference-Time Optimization for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Reflection Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16080v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive visual quality through extensive scaling of training data and model parameters, yet they often struggle with complex scenes and fine-grained details. Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework. Experimental results show that ReflectionFlow significantly outperforms naive noise-level scaling methods, offering a scalable and compute-efficient solution toward higher-quality image synthesis on challenging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code, checkpoints, and datasets are available at \url{https://diffusion-cot.github.io/reflection2perfection}</p></details> |
| **[Intent-aware Diffusion with Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16077v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning has proven effective in training sequential recommendation models by incorporating self-supervised signals from augmented views. Most existing methods generate multiple views from the same interaction sequence through stochastic data augmentation, aiming to align their representations in the embedding space. However, users typically have specific intents when purchasing items (e.g., buying clothes as gifts or cosmetics for beauty). Random data augmentation used in existing methods may introduce noise, disrupting the latent intent information implicit in the original interaction sequence. Moreover, using noisy augmented sequences in contrastive learning may mislead the model to focus on irrelevant features, distorting the embedding space and failing to capture users' true behavior patterns and intents. To address these issues, we propose Intent-aware Diffusion with contrastive learning for sequential Recommendation (InDiRec). The core idea is to generate item sequences aligned with users' purchasing intents, thus providing more reliable augmented views for contrastive learning. Specifically, InDiRec first performs intent clustering on sequence representations using K-means to build intent-guided signals. Next, it retrieves the intent representation of the target interaction sequence to guide a conditional diffusion model, generating positive views that share the same underlying intent. Finally, contrastive learning is applied to maximize representation consistency between these intent-aligned views and the original sequence. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that InDiRec achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines, learning more robust representations even under noisy and sparse data conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SIGIR 2025. 10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[PHYBench: Holistic Evaluation of Physical Perception and Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16074v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PHYBench, a novel, high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in physical contexts. PHYBench consists of 500 meticulously curated physics problems based on real-world physical scenarios, designed to assess the ability of models to understand and reason about realistic physical processes. Covering mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, optics, modern physics, and advanced physics, the benchmark spans difficulty levels from high school exercises to undergraduate problems and Physics Olympiad challenges. Additionally, we propose the Expression Edit Distance (EED) Score, a novel evaluation metric based on the edit distance between mathematical expressions, which effectively captures differences in model reasoning processes and results beyond traditional binary scoring methods. We evaluate various LLMs on PHYBench and compare their performance with human experts. Our results reveal that even state-of-the-art reasoning models significantly lag behind human experts, highlighting their limitations and the need for improvement in complex physical reasoning scenarios. Our benchmark results and dataset are publicly available at https://phybench-official.github.io/phybench-demo/.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages ,8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Describe Anything: Detailed Localized Image and Video Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16072v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating detailed and accurate descriptions for specific regions in images and videos remains a fundamental challenge for vision-language models. We introduce the Describe Anything Model (DAM), a model designed for detailed localized captioning (DLC). DAM preserves both local details and global context through two key innovations: a focal prompt, which ensures high-resolution encoding of targeted regions, and a localized vision backbone, which integrates precise localization with its broader context. To tackle the scarcity of high-quality DLC data, we propose a Semi-supervised learning (SSL)-based Data Pipeline (DLC-SDP). DLC-SDP starts with existing segmentation datasets and expands to unlabeled web images using SSL. We introduce DLC-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate DLC without relying on reference captions. DAM sets new state-of-the-art on 7 benchmarks spanning keyword-level, phrase-level, and detailed multi-sentence localized image and video captioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://describe-anything.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (double column), 0 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)</p></details> |
| **[Reducing the Communication of Distributed Model Predictive Control: Autoencoders and Formation Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05223v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Communication remains a key factor limiting the applicability of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) in realistic settings, despite advances in wireless communication. DMPC schemes can require an overwhelming amount of information exchange between agents as the amount of data depends on the length of the predication horizon, for which some applications require a significant length to formally guarantee nominal asymptotic stability. This work aims to provide an approach to reduce the communication effort of DMPC by reducing the size of the communicated data between agents. Using an autoencoder, the communicated data is reduced by the encoder part of the autoencoder prior to communication and reconstructed by the decoder part upon reception within the distributed optimization algorithm that constitutes the DMPC scheme. The choice of a learning-based reduction method is motivated by structure inherent to the data, which results from the data's connection to solutions of optimal control problems. The approach is implemented and tested at the example of formation control of differential-drive robots, which is challenging for optimization-based control due to the robots' nonholonomic constraints, and which is interesting due to the practical importance of mobile robotics. The applicability of the proposed approach is presented first in form of a simulative analysis showing that the resulting control performance yields a satisfactory accuracy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms the canonical naive way to reduce communication by reducing the length of the prediction horizon. Moreover, it is shown that numerical experiments conducted on embedded computation hardware, with real distributed computation and wireless communication, work well with the proposed way of reducing communication even in practical scenarios in which full communication fails.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |
| **[State Space Models are Strong Text Rerankers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14354v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers dominate NLP and IR; but their inference inefficiencies and challenges in extrapolating to longer contexts have sparked interest in alternative model architectures. Among these, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba offer promising advantages, particularly $O(1)$ time complexity in inference. Despite their potential, SSMs' effectiveness at text reranking -- a task requiring fine-grained query-document interaction and long-context understanding -- remains underexplored. This study benchmarks SSM-based architectures (specifically, Mamba-1 and Mamba-2) against transformer-based models across various scales, architectures, and pre-training objectives, focusing on performance and efficiency in text reranking tasks. We find that (1) Mamba architectures achieve competitive text ranking performance, comparable to transformer-based models of similar size; (2) they are less efficient in training and inference compared to transformers with flash attention; and (3) Mamba-2 outperforms Mamba-1 in both performance and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of state space models as a transformer alternative and highlight areas for improvement in future IR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RepL4NLP 2025.

| **[Vision-Language Models Are Not Pragmatically Competent in Referring Expression Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16060v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Expression Generation (REG) is a core task for evaluating the pragmatic competence of vision-language systems, requiring not only accurate semantic grounding but also adherence to principles of cooperative communication (Grice, 1975). However, current evaluations of vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook the pragmatic dimension, reducing REG to a region-based captioning task and neglecting Gricean maxims. In this work, we revisit REG from a pragmatic perspective, introducing a new dataset (RefOI) of 1.5k images annotated with both written and spoken referring expressions. Through a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, we identify three key failures of pragmatic competence: (1) failure to uniquely identify the referent, (2) inclusion of excessive or irrelevant information, and (3) misalignment with human pragmatic preference, such as the underuse of minimal spatial cues. We also show that standard automatic evaluations fail to capture these pragmatic violations, reinforcing superficial cues rather than genuine referential success. Our findings call for a renewed focus on pragmatically informed models and evaluation frameworks that align with real human communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Homep...</summary><p>Homepage: https://vlm-reg.github.io/</p></details> |

This paper presents an analysis of various Key-Value (KV) cache compression strategies, offering a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes these methods by their underlying principles and implementation techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate their impact on performance and inference latency, providing critical insights into their effectiveness. Our findings highlight the trade-offs involved in KV cache compression and its influence on handling long-context scenarios, paving the way for more efficient LLM implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference (CICC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[SAR4SLPs: An Asynchronous Survey of Speech-Language Pathologists' Perspectives on Socially Assistive Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16055v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) offer unique opportunities within speech language pathology (SLP) education and practice by supporting interactive interventions for children with communication disorders. This paper explores the implementation of SAR4SLPs (Socially Assistive Robots for Speech-Language Pathologists) to investigate aspects such as engagement, therapeutic strategy discipline, and consistent intervention support. We assessed the current application of technology to clinical and educational settings, especially with respect to how SLPs might use SAR in their therapeutic work. An asynchronous remote community (ARC) collaborated with a cohort of practicing SLPs to consider the feasibility, potential effectiveness, and anticipated challenges with implementing SARs in day-to-day interventions and as practice facilitators. We focus in particular on the expressive functionality of SARs, modeling a foundational strategy that SLPs employ across various intervention targets. This paper highlights clinician-driven insights and design implications for developing SARs that support specific treatment goals through collaborative and iterative design.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[LongMamba: Enhancing Mamba's Long Context Capabilities via Training-Free Receptive Field Enlargement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16053v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformer models for language modeling, offering linear computational complexity and constant memory usage as context length increases. However, despite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown that SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to Transformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant shortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding, we propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the long-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery that the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global channels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily responsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the key bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths largely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit limitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's poor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the hidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the accumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first identifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token filtering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba sets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly extending its operational range without requiring additional training. Our code is available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/LongMamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces PRIME (PRoximal Iterative MarkEts), a novel OFO approach based on proximal-point iterations. Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a market-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to make choices that result in a safe and efficient operation, without communicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can cope with non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on an AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear local marginal pricing scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/NicholasBehr/prime</p></details> |
| **[Muon Optimizer Accelerates Grokking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16041v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the impact of different optimizers on the grokking phenomenon, where models exhibit delayed generalization. We conducted experiments across seven numerical tasks (primarily modular arithmetic) using a modern Transformer architecture. The experimental configuration systematically varied the optimizer (Muon vs. AdamW) and the softmax activation function (standard softmax, stablemax, and sparsemax) to assess their combined effect on learning dynamics. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the Muon optimizer, characterized by its use of spectral norm constraints and second-order information, significantly accelerates the onset of grokking compared to the widely used AdamW optimizer. Specifically, Muon reduced the mean grokking epoch from 153.09 to 102.89 across all configurations, a statistically significant difference (t = 5.0175, p = 6.33e-08). This suggests that the optimizer choice plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition from memorization to generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Splitting Method for Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04360v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the two-dimensional stochastic steady-state Navier-Stokes(NS) equations with additive random noise. We introduce an innovative splitting method that decomposes the stochastic NS equations into a deterministic NS component and a stochastic equation. We rigorously analyze the proposed splitting method from the perspectives of equivalence, stability, existence and uniqueness of the solution. We also propose a modified splitting scheme, which simplified the stochastic equation by omitting its nonlinear terms. A detailed analysis of the solution properties for this modified approach is provided. Additionally, we discuss the statistical errors with both the original splitting format and the modified scheme. Our theoretical and numerical studies demonstrate that the equivalent splitting scheme exhibits significantly enhanced stability compared to the original stochastic NS equations, enabling more effective handling of nonlinear characteristics. Several numerical experiments were performed to compare the statistical errors of the splitting method and the modified splitting method. Notably, the deterministic NS equation in the splitting method does not require repeated solving, and the stochastic equation in the modified scheme is free of nonlinear terms. These features make the modified splitting method particularly advantageous for large-scale computations, as it significantly improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | pages 30 |

Traditional centralized architectures struggle with latency, privacy concerns, and excessive resource consumption, making them unsuitable for modern large-scale IoT deployments. This paper presents a novel Federated Learning-driven Large Language Model (FL-LLM) framework, designed to enhance IoT system intelligence while ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. The framework integrates Generative IoT (GIoT) models with a Gradient Sensing Federated Strategy (GSFS), dynamically optimizing model updates based on real-time network conditions. By leveraging a hybrid edge-cloud processing architecture, our approach balances intelligence, scalability, and security in distributed IoT environments. Evaluations on the IoT-23 dataset demonstrate that our framework improves model accuracy, reduces response latency, and enhances energy efficiency, outperforming traditional FL techniques (i.e., FedAvg, FedOpt). These findings highlight the potential of integrating LLM-powered federated learning into large-scale IoT ecosystems, paving the way for more secure, scalable, and adaptive IoT management solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Conceptual Model for Attributions in Event-Centric Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03563v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of narratives as a means of fusing information from knowledge graphs (KGs) into a coherent line of argumentation has been the subject of recent investigation. Narratives are especially useful in event-centric knowledge graphs in that they provide a means to connect different real-world events and categorize them by well-known narrations. However, specifically for controversial events, a problem in information fusion arises, namely, multiple viewpoints regarding the validity of certain event aspects, e.g., regarding the role a participant takes in an event, may exist. Expressing those viewpoints in KGs is challenging because disputed information provided by different viewpoints may introduce inconsistencies. Hence, most KGs only feature a single view on the contained information, hampering the effectiveness of narrative information access. This paper is an extension of our original work and introduces attributions, i.e., parameterized predicates that allow for the representation of facts that are only valid in a specific viewpoint. For this, we develop a conceptual model that allows for the representation of viewpoint-dependent information. As an extension, we enhance the model by a conception of viewpoint-compatibility. Based on this, we deepen our original deliberations on the model's effects on information fusion and provide additional grounding in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Data & Knowledge Engineering, 22 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

Early research used computer vision to predict living conditions in areas with limited data, but recent studies increasingly focus on causal analysis. Despite this shift, the use of EO-ML methods for causal inference lacks thorough documentation, and best practices are still developing. Through a comprehensive scoping review, we catalog the current literature on EO-ML methods in causal analysis. We synthesize five principal approaches to incorporating EO data in causal workflows: (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. Building on these findings, we provide a detailed protocol guiding researchers in integrating EO data into causal analysis -- covering data requirements, computer vision model selection, and evaluation metrics. While our focus centers on health and living conditions outcomes, our protocol is adaptable to other sustainable development domains utilizing EO data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as: Sakamoto, Kazuki, Connor T.

| **[LiveCC: Learning Video LLM with Streaming Speech Transcription at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16030v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent video large language models (Video LLMs) often depend on costly human annotations or proprietary model APIs (e.g., GPT-4o) to produce training data, which limits their training at scale. In this paper, we explore large-scale training for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. Specifically, we propose a novel streaming training approach that densely interleaves the ASR words and video frames according to their timestamps. Compared to previous studies in vision-language representation with ASR, our method naturally fits the streaming characteristics of ASR, thus enabling the model to learn temporally-aligned, fine-grained vision-language modeling. To support the training algorithm, we introduce a data production pipeline to process YouTube videos and their closed captions (CC, same as ASR), resulting in Live-CC-5M dataset for pre-training and Live-WhisperX-526K dataset for high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, even without SFT, the ASR-only pre-trained LiveCC-7B-Base model demonstrates competitive general video QA performance and exhibits a new capability in real-time video commentary. To evaluate this, we carefully design a new LiveSports-3K benchmark, using LLM-as-a-judge to measure the free-form commentary. Experiments show our final LiveCC-7B-Instruct model can surpass advanced 72B models (Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct, LLaVA-Video-72B) in commentary quality even working in a real-time mode. Meanwhile, it achieves state-of-the-art results at the 7B/8B scale on popular video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME and OVOBench, demonstrating the broad generalizability of our approach.

| **[PointLoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Token Selection for Point Cloud Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16023v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised representation learning for point cloud has demonstrated effectiveness in improving pre-trained model performance across diverse tasks. However, as pre-trained models grow in complexity, fully fine-tuning them for downstream applications demands substantial computational and storage resources. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these resource requirements, yet most current approaches rely on complex adapter and prompt mechanisms that increase tunable parameters. In this paper, we propose PointLoRA, a simple yet effective method that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with multi-scale token selection to efficiently fine-tune point cloud models. Our approach embeds LoRA layers within the most parameter-intensive components of point cloud transformers, reducing the need for tunable parameters while enhancing global feature capture. Additionally, multi-scale token selection extracts critical local information to serve as prompts for downstream fine-tuning, effectively complementing the global context captured by LoRA. The experimental results across various pre-trained models and three challenging public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with only 3.43% of the trainable parameters, making it highly effective for resource-constrained applications.

Even while several large-scale solutions offer distributed execution environments, open-source alternatives that integrate scalable runtime tools, deep learning and data frameworks on high-performance computing platforms remain crucial for accessibility and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce Deep Radical-Cylon(RC), a heterogeneous runtime system that combines data engineering, deep learning frameworks, and workflow engines across several HPC environments, including cloud and supercomputing infrastructures. Deep RC supports heterogeneous systems with accelerators, allows the usage of communication libraries like MPI, GLOO and NCCL across multi-node setups, and facilitates parallel and distributed deep learning pipelines by utilizing Radical Pilot as a task execution framework. By attaining an end-to-end pipeline including preprocessing, model training, and postprocessing with 11 neural forecasting models (PyTorch) and hydrology models (TensorFlow) under identical resource conditions, the system reduces 3.28 and 75.9 seconds, respectively.

Typically, the control of interaction torques in partial-assistance exoskeletons relies on a hierarchical control structure. These approaches require extensive calibration due to the complexity of the controller and user-specific parameter tuning, especially for activities like stair or ramp navigation. To address the limitations of hierarchical control in exoskeletons, this work proposes a three-step, data-driven approach: (1) using recent sensor data to probabilistically infer locomotion states (landing step length, landing step height, walking velocity, step clearance, gait phase), (2) allowing therapists to modify these features via a user interface, and (3) using the adjusted locomotion features to predict the desired joint posture and model stiffness in a spring-damper system based on prediction uncertainty. We evaluated the proposed approach with two healthy participants engaging in treadmill walking and stair ascent and descent at varying speeds, with and without external modification of the gait features through a user interface. Results showed a variation in kinematics according to the gait characteristics and a negative interaction power suggesting exoskeleton assistance across the different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM FOR REHABILITATION ROBOTICS 2025</p></details> |

In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the input space is taken while keeping the ratio of the dataset size against the input dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property in the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.</p></details> | 33 pages, 14 figures |

By inserting small, learnable modules into pretrained diffusion models, these adapters can maintain temporal coherence without extensive retraining. Approaches that incorporate prompt learning with both shared and frame-specific tokens are particularly effective in preserving continuity across frames at low training cost. In this work, we want to provide a general theoretical framework for adapters that maintain frame consistency in DDIM-based models under a temporal consistency loss. First, we prove that the temporal consistency objective is differentiable under bounded feature norms, and we establish a Lipschitz bound on its gradient. Second, we show that gradient descent on this objective decreases the loss monotonically and converges to a local minimum if the learning rate is within an appropriate range. Finally, we analyze the stability of modules in the DDIM inversion procedure, showing that the associated error remains controlled. These theoretical findings will reinforce the reliability of diffusion-based video editing methods that rely on adapter strategies and provide theoretical insights in video generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.04606</p></details> |

However, existing additive methods, such as adapters, sometimes struggle to capture distributional shifts in intermediate feature embeddings. We propose a novel histogram-based parameter-efficient tuning (HPT) technique that captures the statistics of the target domain and modulates the embeddings. Experimental results on three downstream passive sonar datasets (ShipsEar, DeepShip, VTUAD) demonstrate that HPT outperforms conventional adapters. Notably, HPT achieves 91.8% vs. 89.8% accuracy on VTUAD. Furthermore, HPT trains faster and yields feature representations closer to those of fully fine-tuned models. Overall, HPT balances parameter savings and performance, providing a distribution-aware alternative to existing adapters and shows a promising direction for scalable transfer learning in resource-constrained environments.

Yet their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. While automated prompt optimization addresses this challenge by finding optimal prompts, current methods require a substantial number of LLM calls and input tokens, making prompt optimization expensive. We introduce CAPO (Cost-Aware Prompt Optimization), an algorithm that enhances prompt optimization efficiency by integrating AutoML techniques. CAPO is an evolutionary approach with LLMs as operators, incorporating racing to save evaluations and multi-objective optimization to balance performance with prompt length. It jointly optimizes instructions and few-shot examples while leveraging task descriptions for improved robustness. Our extensive experiments across diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that CAPO outperforms state-of-the-art discrete prompt optimization methods in 11/15 cases with improvements up to 21%p. Our algorithm achieves better performances already with smaller budgets, saves evaluations through racing, and decreases average prompt length via a length penalty, making it both cost-efficient and cost-aware. Even without few-shot examples, CAPO outperforms its competitors and generally remains robust to initial prompts. CAPO represents an important step toward making prompt optimization more powerful and accessible by improving cost-efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AutoML 2025</p></details> |

The current methods used to assess the characteristic lift and drag coefficients include Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), thin aerofoil and panel methods, all face trade-offs between computational speed and the accuracy of the results and as such NNs have been investigated as an alternative with the aim that it would perform both quickly and accurately. As such, this paper provides a benchmark for the windAI_bench dataset published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA. In order to validate the methodology of the benchmarking, the AirfRANS {\tt arXiv:2212.07564v3} dataset is used as both a starting point and a point of comparison. This study evaluates four neural networks (MLP, PointNet, GraphSAGE, GUNet) trained on a range aerofoils at 25 angles of attack (4$^\circ$ to 20$^\circ$). to predict fluid flow and calculate lift coefficients ($C_L$) via the panel method. GraphSAGE and GUNet performed well during the testing phase, but underperformed during validation. Accordingly, this paper has identified PointNet and MLP as the two strongest models tested, however whilst the results from MLP are more commonly correct for predicting the behaviour of the fluid, the results from PointNet provide the more accurate results for calculating $C_L$.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, submitted to EWTEC</p></details> |

However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells. Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process. Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%. Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption. These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs but also require more computing resources and processing time, which impacts overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information, further enhancing the framework's performance. Experimental results with long prompt tokens demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, significantly reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Reason under Off-Policy Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14945v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning (RL) with simple rule-based rewards. However, existing zero-RL approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY guidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Notably, we propose policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Remarkably, LUFFY achieves an over +7.0 average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over +6.2 points in out-of-distribution tasks. It also substantially surpasses imitation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in generalization. Analysis shows LUFFY not only imitates effectively but also explores beyond demonstrations, offering a scalable path to train generalizable reasoning models with off-policy guidance.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, our understating of the theory of $\texttt{FL}$ is still fragmented, and a thorough, formal comparison of these algorithms remains elusive. Motivated by this gap, we show that many of the existing $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms can be understood from an operator splitting point of view. This unification allows us to compare different algorithms with ease, to refine previous convergence results and to uncover new algorithmic variants. In particular, our analysis reveals the vital role played by the step size in $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms. The unification also leads to a streamlined and economic way to accelerate $\texttt{FL}$ algorithms, without incurring any communication overhead. We perform numerical experiments on both convex and nonconvex models to validate our findings.</p></details> | 30 pages, 28 figures |

Previous work in this area has primarily focused on manual design or training-based neural architecture search (NAS) methods. Recently, zero-shot NAS methods have been proposed for evaluating language models without the need for training. However, prevailing approaches to zero-shot NAS often face challenges such as biased evaluation metrics and computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce weight-weighted PCA (W-PCA), a novel zero-shot NAS method specifically tailored for lightweight language models. Our approach utilizes two evaluation proxies: the parameter count and the number of principal components with cumulative contribution exceeding $\eta$ in the feed-forward neural (FFN) layer. Additionally, by eliminating the need for gradient computations, we optimize the evaluation time, thus enhancing the efficiency of designing and evaluating lightweight language models. We conduct a comparative analysis on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets to evaluate our approach. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces training time compared to one-shot NAS methods and achieves higher scores in the testing phase compared to previous state-of-the-art training-based methods. Furthermore, we perform ranking evaluations on a dataset sampled from the FlexiBERT search space. Our approach exhibits superior ranking correlation and further reduces solving time compared to other zero-shot NAS methods that require gradient computation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework. Experimental results show that ReflectionFlow significantly outperforms naive noise-level scaling methods, offering a scalable and compute-efficient solution toward higher-quality image synthesis on challenging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code, checkpoints, and datasets are available at \url{https://diffusion-cot.github.io/reflection2perfection}</p></details> |

By training a Random Forest to discriminate between real data and synthetic data sampled from a uniform distribution over the real data bounds, a distance measure is obtained that anisometrically transforms the data, expanding distances at the boundary of the data manifold. We show that using distances recovered from this transformation improves the accuracy of unsupervised anomaly detection, compared to other commonly used detectors, demonstrated over a large number of benchmark datasets. As well as improved performance, this method has advantages over other unsupervised anomaly detection methods, including minimal requirements for data preprocessing, native handling of missing data, and potential for visualizations. By relating outlier scores to partitions of the Random Forest, we develop a method for locally explainable anomaly predictions in terms of feature importance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Among these, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba offer promising advantages, particularly $O(1)$ time complexity in inference. Despite their potential, SSMs' effectiveness at text reranking -- a task requiring fine-grained query-document interaction and long-context understanding -- remains underexplored. This study benchmarks SSM-based architectures (specifically, Mamba-1 and Mamba-2) against transformer-based models across various scales, architectures, and pre-training objectives, focusing on performance and efficiency in text reranking tasks. We find that (1) Mamba architectures achieve competitive text ranking performance, comparable to transformer-based models of similar size; (2) they are less efficient in training and inference compared to transformers with flash attention; and (3) Mamba-2 outperforms Mamba-1 in both performance and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of state space models as a transformer alternative and highlight areas for improvement in future IR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to RepL4NLP 2025.

However, despite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown that SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to Transformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant shortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding, we propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the long-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery that the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global channels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily responsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the key bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths largely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit limitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's poor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the hidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the accumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first identifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token filtering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba sets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly extending its operational range without requiring additional training.

We conducted experiments across seven numerical tasks (primarily modular arithmetic) using a modern Transformer architecture. The experimental configuration systematically varied the optimizer (Muon vs. AdamW) and the softmax activation function (standard softmax, stablemax, and sparsemax) to assess their combined effect on learning dynamics. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the Muon optimizer, characterized by its use of spectral norm constraints and second-order information, significantly accelerates the onset of grokking compared to the widely used AdamW optimizer. Specifically, Muon reduced the mean grokking epoch from 153.09 to 102.89 across all configurations, a statistically significant difference (t = 5.0175, p = 6.33e-08). This suggests that the optimizer choice plays a crucial role in facilitating the transition from memorization to generalization.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

However, as pre-trained models grow in complexity, fully fine-tuning them for downstream applications demands substantial computational and storage resources. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these resource requirements, yet most current approaches rely on complex adapter and prompt mechanisms that increase tunable parameters. In this paper, we propose PointLoRA, a simple yet effective method that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with multi-scale token selection to efficiently fine-tune point cloud models. Our approach embeds LoRA layers within the most parameter-intensive components of point cloud transformers, reducing the need for tunable parameters while enhancing global feature capture. Additionally, multi-scale token selection extracts critical local information to serve as prompts for downstream fine-tuning, effectively complementing the global context captured by LoRA. The experimental results across various pre-trained models and three challenging public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with only 3.43% of the trainable parameters, making it highly effective for resource-constrained applications.

However, challenges in reliably interpreting EEG signals for specific tasks, such as simulating keystrokes, persist due to the complexity and variability of brain activity. Current EEG-based BMIs face limitations in adaptability, usability, and robustness, especially in applications like virtual keyboards, as traditional machine-learning models struggle to handle high-dimensional EEG data effectively. To address these gaps, we developed an EEG-based BMI system capable of accurately identifying voluntary keystrokes, specifically leveraging right and left voluntary hand movements. Using a publicly available EEG dataset, the signals were pre-processed with band-pass filtering, segmented into 22-electrode arrays, and refined into event-related potential (ERP) windows, resulting in a 19x200 feature array categorized into three classes: resting state (0), 'd' key press (1), and 'l' key press (2). Our approach employs a hybrid neural network architecture with BiGRU-Attention as the proposed model for interpreting EEG signals, achieving superior test accuracy of 90% and a mean accuracy of 91% in 10-fold stratified cross-validation. This performance outperforms traditional ML methods like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes, as well as advanced architectures such as Transformers, CNN-Transformer hybrids, and EEGNet. Finally, the BiGRU-Attention model is integrated into a real-time graphical user interface (GUI) to simulate and predict keystrokes from brain activity. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can advance EEG-based BMI systems by addressing the challenges of signal interpretation and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please note: This is the preprint version of the manuscript.

| **[SWITCH: Studying with Teacher for Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19503v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to high inference costs and memory requirements. To address these issues, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a popular method for model compression, with student-generated outputs (SGOs) as training data being particularly notable for reducing the mismatch between training and inference. However, SGOs often produce noisy and biased sequences, which can lead to misguidance from the teacher model, especially in long sequences. To mitigate these challenges, we propose SWITCH (Studying WIth TeaCHer for Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach that strategically incorporates the teacher model during the student's sequence generation. SWITCH identifies discrepancies between the token probabilities of the teacher and student models, allowing the teacher to intervene selectively, particularly in long sequences that are more prone to teacher misguidance. Extensive experimental results across three model families and five instruction-following datasets show that SWITCH surpasses traditional KD methods, particularly excelling in the generation of long sequential data.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

With the rise of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), its application in process control has attracted widespread attention. However, the extremely low sample efficiency and the safety concerns caused by exploration in DRL hinder its practical implementation in industrial settings. Transfer learning offers an effective solution for DRL, enhancing its generalization and adaptability in multi-mode control scenarios. This paper provides insights into the use of DRL for process control from the perspective of transfer learning. We analyze the challenges of applying DRL in the process industry and the necessity of introducing transfer learning. Furthermore, recommendations and prospects are provided for future research directions on how transfer learning can be integrated with DRL to enhance process control. This paper aims to offer a set of promising, user-friendly, easy-to-implement, and scalable approaches to artificial intelligence-facilitated industrial control for scholars and engineers in the process industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chine...</summary><p>Chinese Control and Decision Conference (CCDC 2025), Oral, Regular Paper & Asian Control Conference (ASCC 2024), Oral, Position Paper</p></details> |
| **[A Fast Direct Solver for Boundary Integral Equations Using Quadrature By Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13809v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct and analyze a hierarchical direct solver for linear systems arising from the discretization of boundary integral equations using the Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) method. Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID\@. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures; fixed TeX formatting (v2)</p></details> |

This survey presents a comprehensive exploration of how GNNs may be harnessed in 6G IoT environments, focusing on key challenges and opportunities through a series of open questions. We commence with an exploration of GNN paradigms and the roles of node, edge, and graph-level tasks in solving wireless networking problems and highlight GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization methods. This guidance enhances problem-solving efficiency across various next-generation (NG) IoT scenarios. Next, we provide a detailed discussion of the application of GNN in advanced NG enabling technologies, including massive MIMO, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, satellites, THz, mobile edge computing (MEC), and ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC). We then delve into the challenges posed by adversarial attacks, offering insights into defense mechanisms to secure GNN-based NG-IoT networks. Next, we examine how GNNs can be integrated with future technologies like integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), satellite-air-ground-sea integrated networks (SAGSIN), and quantum computing. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of GNNs in improving efficiency, scalability, and security within NG-IoT systems, paving the way for future advances.

| **[Efficient algorithms for the Hadamard decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13633v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, preprint submitted to IEEE MLSP 2025, code available from https://github.com/WertzSamuel/HadamardDecompositions</p></details> |
| **[Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15758v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.</p></details> | First version |

The symbolic module of Tratto takes advantage of the grammar of the programming language, the unit under test, and the context of the unit (its class and available APIs) to restrict the search space of the tokens that can be successfully used to generate valid oracles. The neural module of Tratto uses transformers fine-tuned for both deciding whether to output an oracle or not and selecting the next lexical token to incrementally build the oracle from the set of tokens returned by the symbolic module. Our experiments show that Tratto outperforms the state-of-the-art axiomatic oracle generation approaches, with 73% accuracy, 72% precision, and 61% F1-score, largely higher than the best results of the symbolic and neural approaches considered in our study (61%, 62%, and 37%, respectively). Tratto can generate three times more axiomatic oracles than current symbolic approaches, while generating 10 times less false positives than GPT4 complemented with few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought prompting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ISSTA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Proving Cypher Query Equivalence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15742v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph database systems store graph data as nodes and relationships, and utilize graph query languages (e.g., Cypher) for efficiently querying graph data. Proving the equivalence of graph queries is an important foundation for optimizing graph query performance, ensuring graph query reliability, etc. Although researchers have proposed many SQL query equivalence provers for relational database systems, these provers cannot be directly applied to prove the equivalence of graph queries. The difficulty lies in the fact that graph query languages (e.g., Cypher) adopt significantly different data models (property graph model vs. relational model) and query patterns (graph pattern matching vs. tabular tuple calculus) from SQL. In this paper, we propose GraphQE, an automated prover to determine whether two Cypher queries are semantically equivalent. We design a U-semiring based Cypher algebraic representation to model the semantics of Cypher queries. Our Cypher algebraic representation is built on the algebraic structure of unbounded semirings, and can sufficiently express nodes and relationships in property graphs and complex Cypher queries. Then, determining the equivalence of two Cypher queries is transformed into determining the equivalence of the corresponding Cypher algebraic representations, which can be verified by SMT solvers. To evaluate the effectiveness of GraphQE, we construct a dataset consisting of 148 pairs of equivalent Cypher queries. Among them, we have successfully proven 138 pairs of equivalent Cypher queries, demonstrating the effectiveness of GraphQE.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[RRC Signaling Storm Detection in O-RAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15738v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) marks a significant shift in the mobile network industry. By transforming a traditionally vertically integrated architecture into an open, data-driven one, O-RAN promises to enhance operational flexibility and drive innovation. In this paper, we harness O-RAN's openness to address one critical threat to 5G availability: signaling storms caused by abuse of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol. Such attacks occur when a flood of RRC messages from one or multiple User Equipments (UEs) deplete resources at a 5G base station (gNB), leading to service degradation. We provide a reference implementation of an RRC signaling storm attack, using the OpenAirInterface (OAI) platform to evaluate its impact on a gNB. We supplement the experimental results with a theoretical model to extend the findings for different load conditions. To mitigate RRC signaling storms, we develop a threshold-based detection technique that relies on RRC layer features to distinguish between malicious activity and legitimate high network load conditions. Leveraging O-RAN capabilities, our detection method is deployed as an external Application (xApp). Performance evaluation shows attacks can be detected within 90ms, providing a mitigation window of 60ms before gNB unavailability, with an overhead of 1.2% and 0% CPU and memory consumption, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE ISCC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Energy-Efficient SIM-assisted Communications: How Many Layers Do We Need?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15737v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), comprising multiple layers of reconfigurable transmissive metasurfaces, is becoming an increasingly viable solution for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we explore the integration of SIM in a multi-antenna base station for application to downlink multi-user communications, and a realistic power consumption model for SIM-assisted systems is presented. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) for hybrid precoding design, i.e., the base station digital precoding and SIM wave-based beamforming. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, we employ the quadratic transformation method to reformulate the optimization problem and propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint precoding framework. Specifically, a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is adopted for the base station precoding design. For the SIM wave-based beamforming, two algorithms are employed: the high-performance semidefinite programming (SDP) method and the low-complexity projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm. In particular, the results indicate that while the optimal number of SIM layers for maximizing the EE and spectral efficiency differs, a design of 2 to 5 layers can achieve satisfactory performance for both. Finally, numerical results are illustrated to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid precoding framework and to showcase the performance enhancement achieved by the algorithm in comparison to benchmark schemes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

The RISC-V "V" Vector Extension (RVV) enhances algorithm efficiency by supporting vector registers of dynamic sizes and their grouping. Nevertheless, for very long vectors, the static number of RVV vector registers and its power-of-two grouping can lead to performance restrictions. To counteract this limitation, this work introduces Zoozve, a RISC-V vector instruction extension that eliminates the need for strip-mining. Zoozve allows for flexible vector register length and count configurations to boost data computation parallelism. With a data-adaptive register allocation approach, Zoozve permits any register groupings and accurately aligns vector lengths, cutting down register overhead and alleviating performance declines from strip-mining. Additionally, the paper details Zoozve's compiler and hardware implementations using LLVM and SystemVerilog. Initial results indicate Zoozve yields a minimum 10.10$\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count for fast Fourier transform (FFT), with a mere 5.2\% increase in overall silicon area.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, LCTES'25</p></details> |

Capable of managing both digital and physical assets and unlike traditional Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), DAMs extend autonomy into the physical world, enabling trustless systems for Real and Digital World Assets (RDWAs). In this paper, we explore the technological foundations, and challenges of DAMs and argue that DAMs are pivotal in transitioning from trust-based to trustless economic models, offering scalable, transparent, and equitable solutions for asset management. The integration of AI-driven decision-making, IoT-enabled operational autonomy, and blockchain-based governance allows DAMs to decentralize ownership, optimize resource allocation, and democratize access to economic opportunities. Therefore, in this research, we highlight the potential of DAMs to address inefficiencies in centralized systems, reduce wealth disparities, and foster a post-labor economy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in IEEE International Workshop on Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks 2025, in conjunction with ICBC'25. 7 pages. 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Equi-Euler GraphNet: An Equivariant, Temporal-Dynamics Informed Graph Neural Network for Dual Force and Trajectory Prediction in Multi-Body Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13768v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>permi...</summary><p>permission not yet received for arXiv</p></details> |

Existing approaches to mitigate models' dependence on spurious features work in some cases, but fail in others. In this paper, we systematically analyze how and where neural networks encode spurious correlations. We introduce the neuron spurious score, an XAI-based diagnostic measure to quantify a neuron's dependence on spurious features. We analyze both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) using architecture-specific methods. Our results show that spurious features are partially disentangled, but the degree of disentanglement varies across model architectures. Furthermore, we find that the assumptions behind existing mitigation methods are incomplete. Our results lay the groundwork for the development of novel methods to mitigate spurious correlations and make AI models safer to use in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The World Conference on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence 2025 (XAI-2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Falcon, an innovative semi-autoregressive speculative decoding framework fashioned to augment both the drafter's parallelism and output quality. Falcon incorporates the Coupled Sequential Glancing Distillation technique, which fortifies inter-token dependencies within the same block, leading to increased speculation accuracy. We offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a Custom-Designed Decoding Tree, which permits the drafter to generate multiple tokens in a single forward pass and accommodates multiple forward passes as needed, thereby boosting the number of drafted tokens and significantly improving the overall acceptance rate. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K demonstrate Falcon's superior acceleration capabilities. The framework achieves a lossless speedup ratio ranging from 2.91x to 3.51x when tested on the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat model series. These results outstrip existing speculative decoding methods for LLMs, including Eagle, Medusa, Lookahead, SPS, and PLD, while maintaining a compact drafter architecture equivalent to merely two Transformer layers.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Accepted |

Accurate real-time forecasting of drying readiness is crucial for minimizing energy consumption, improving productivity, and ensuring product quality. However, this remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of drying, limited data availability, and the lack of effective predictive analytical methods. To address this gap, we propose an end-to-end multi-modal data fusion framework that integrates in-situ video data with process parameters for real-time food drying readiness forecasting. Our approach leverages a new encoder-decoder architecture with modality-specific encoders and a transformer-based decoder to effectively extract features while preserving the unique structure of each modality. We apply our approach to sugar cookie drying, where time-to-ready is predicted at each timestamp. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an average prediction error of only 15 seconds, outperforming state-of-the-art data fusion methods by 65.69% and a video-only model by 11.30%. Additionally, our model balances prediction accuracy, model size, and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for heterogenous industrial datasets. The proposed model is extensible to various other industrial modality fusion tasks for online decision-making.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

While our model does not surpass existing baselines on downstream tasks, it achieves good results on fill-mask test evaluations. We also analyze the effect of context length expansion through pseudo-perplexity experiments. Furthermore, we investigate sentence embeddings in detail, analyzing their transitions during training and comparing them with those from other existing models, confirming similar trends with models sharing the same architecture. To support reproducibility and foster the development of long-context BERT, we release our model, along with the training and evaluation code.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences.

Our approach harnesses the insights from sensor data to accurately predict the remaining lifetime distribution of critical generation assets in hydropower systems, i.e., thrust bearings, and use these predictions to optimally schedule O&M actions for a fleet of hydro generators. We consider complex interdependencies across hydro generator failure risks, reservoir, production, and demand management decisions. We propose a stochastic joint O&M scheduling model to tackle the unique challenges of hydropower O&M including the interdependency of generation capacities, the nonlinear nature of power production, operational requirements, and uncertainties. We develop a two-level decomposition-based solution algorithm to effectively handle large-scale cases. The algorithm incorporates a combination of Benders optimality cuts and integer cuts to solve the problem in an efficient manner. We design an experimental framework to evaluate the proposed prognostics-driven O&M scheduling framework, using real-world condition monitoring data from hydropower systems, historical market prices, and water inflow data. The developed framework can be partially implemented for a phased-in approach. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of the sensor-driven O&M framework in improving reliability, availability, effective usage of resources, and system profitability, especially when gradually shifting from traditional time-based maintenance policies to condition-based prognostics-driven maintenance policies.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

Inspired by the self-reflection capabilities emergent in large language models, we propose ReflectionFlow, an inference-time framework enabling diffusion models to iteratively reflect upon and refine their outputs. ReflectionFlow introduces three complementary inference-time scaling axes: (1) noise-level scaling to optimize latent initialization; (2) prompt-level scaling for precise semantic guidance; and most notably, (3) reflection-level scaling, which explicitly provides actionable reflections to iteratively assess and correct previous generations. To facilitate reflection-level scaling, we construct GenRef, a large-scale dataset comprising 1 million triplets, each containing a reflection, a flawed image, and an enhanced image. Leveraging this dataset, we efficiently perform reflection tuning on state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, FLUX.1-dev, by jointly modeling multimodal inputs within a unified framework. Experimental results show that ReflectionFlow significantly outperforms naive noise-level scaling methods, offering a scalable and compute-efficient solution toward higher-quality image synthesis on challenging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code, checkpoints, and datasets are available at \url{https://diffusion-cot.github.io/reflection2perfection}</p></details> |
| **[A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (double column), 0 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)</p></details> |

Among these, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba offer promising advantages, particularly $O(1)$ time complexity in inference. Despite their potential, SSMs' effectiveness at text reranking -- a task requiring fine-grained query-document interaction and long-context understanding -- remains underexplored. This study benchmarks SSM-based architectures (specifically, Mamba-1 and Mamba-2) against transformer-based models across various scales, architectures, and pre-training objectives, focusing on performance and efficiency in text reranking tasks. We find that (1) Mamba architectures achieve competitive text ranking performance, comparable to transformer-based models of similar size; (2) they are less efficient in training and inference compared to transformers with flash attention; and (3) Mamba-2 outperforms Mamba-1 in both performance and efficiency.

This paper introduces PRIME (PRoximal Iterative MarkEts), a novel OFO approach based on proximal-point iterations. Unlike existing OFO solutions, PRIME admits a market-based implementation, where self-interested actors are incentivized to make choices that result in a safe and efficient operation, without communicating private costs or constraints. Furthermore, PRIME can cope with non-smooth objective functions, achieve fast convergence rates and rapid constraint satisfaction, and reject measurement noise. We demonstrate PRIME on an AC optimal power flow problem, obtaining an efficient real-time nonlinear local marginal pricing scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/NicholasBehr/prime</p></details> |

We motivate that algorithms and application behavior should guide the composition of heterogeneous on-chip memories. However, there has been little work in factoring dynamic application profiles into such design decisions. We present GainSight, a profiling framework that analyzes fine-grained memory access patterns and computes data lifetimes in domain-specific accelerators. By combining instrumentation and simulation across retargetable hardware backends, GainSight aligns heterogeneous memory designs with workload-specific traffic and lifetime metrics. Case studies on MLPerf Inference and PolyBench workloads using NVIDIA H100 GPUs and systolic arrays reveal key insights: (1) 40% of L1 and 18% of L2 GPU cache accesses, and 79% of systolic array scratchpad accesses across profiled workloads are short-lived and suitable for silicon-based gain cell RAM (Si-GCRAM); (2) Si-GCRAM reduces active energy by 11-28% compared to SRAM; (3) Up to 90% of GPU cache fetches are never reused, highlighting inefficiencies in terms of cache pollution. These insights that GainSight provides can be used to better understand the design spaces of both emerging on-chip memories and software algorithmic optimizations for the next generation of AI accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures.

Early research used computer vision to predict living conditions in areas with limited data, but recent studies increasingly focus on causal analysis. Despite this shift, the use of EO-ML methods for causal inference lacks thorough documentation, and best practices are still developing. Through a comprehensive scoping review, we catalog the current literature on EO-ML methods in causal analysis. We synthesize five principal approaches to incorporating EO data in causal workflows: (1) outcome imputation for downstream causal analysis, (2) EO image deconfounding, (3) EO-based treatment effect heterogeneity, (4) EO-based transportability analysis, and (5) image-informed causal discovery. Building on these findings, we provide a detailed protocol guiding researchers in integrating EO data into causal analysis -- covering data requirements, computer vision model selection, and evaluation metrics. While our focus centers on health and living conditions outcomes, our protocol is adaptable to other sustainable development domains utilizing EO data.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as: Sakamoto, Kazuki, Connor T.

Typically, the control of interaction torques in partial-assistance exoskeletons relies on a hierarchical control structure. These approaches require extensive calibration due to the complexity of the controller and user-specific parameter tuning, especially for activities like stair or ramp navigation. To address the limitations of hierarchical control in exoskeletons, this work proposes a three-step, data-driven approach: (1) using recent sensor data to probabilistically infer locomotion states (landing step length, landing step height, walking velocity, step clearance, gait phase), (2) allowing therapists to modify these features via a user interface, and (3) using the adjusted locomotion features to predict the desired joint posture and model stiffness in a spring-damper system based on prediction uncertainty. We evaluated the proposed approach with two healthy participants engaging in treadmill walking and stair ascent and descent at varying speeds, with and without external modification of the gait features through a user interface. Results showed a variation in kinematics according to the gait characteristics and a negative interaction power suggesting exoskeleton assistance across the different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM FOR REHABILITATION ROBOTICS 2025</p></details> |

| **[Token-Aware Coding Flow: A Study with Nano Surge in Reasoning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15989v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization. However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells. Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process. Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%. Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption. These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A New Graph Grammar Formalism for Robust Syntactic Pattern Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15975v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>I introduce a formalism for representing the syntax of recursively structured graph-like patterns. It does not use production rules, like a conventional graph grammar, but represents the syntactic structure in a more direct and declarative way. The grammar and the pattern are both represented as networks, and parsing is seen as the construction of a homomorphism from the pattern to the grammar. The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested recursive structure in more than one dimension. This supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of pattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in missing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single process, to exploit the synergy between them. The emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also give some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex recursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in geometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols, cluttered images, and erased patches.</p></details> | 64 pages, 23 figures |
| **[SWITCH: Studying with Teacher for Knowledge Distillation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19503v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they still face challenges related to high inference costs and memory requirements. To address these issues, Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a popular method for model compression, with student-generated outputs (SGOs) as training data being particularly notable for reducing the mismatch between training and inference. However, SGOs often produce noisy and biased sequences, which can lead to misguidance from the teacher model, especially in long sequences. To mitigate these challenges, we propose SWITCH (Studying WIth TeaCHer for Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach that strategically incorporates the teacher model during the student's sequence generation. SWITCH identifies discrepancies between the token probabilities of the teacher and student models, allowing the teacher to intervene selectively, particularly in long sequences that are more prone to teacher misguidance. Extensive experimental results across three model families and five instruction-following datasets show that SWITCH surpasses traditional KD methods, particularly excelling in the generation of long sequential data.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

However, due to the finite samples of previous studies, our knowledge of true model performance in the target population is uncertain, and so choosing fixed values represents an incomplete picture. As well, for net benefit (NB) as a measure of clinical utility, the relevance of conventional precision-based inference is doubtful. In this work, we propose a general Bayesian algorithm for constructing the joint distribution of predicted risks and response values based on summary statistics of model performance in previous studies. For statistical metrics of performance, we propose sample size determination rules that either target desired expected precision, or a desired assurance probability that the precision criteria will be satisfied. For NB, we propose rules based on optimality assurance (the probability that the planned study correctly identifies the most beneficial strategy) and the Expected Value of Sample Information (EVSI), the expected gain in NB from the planned validation study. We showcase these developments in a case study on the validation of a risk prediction model for deterioration of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Compared to the conventional sample size calculation methods, a Bayesian approach requires explicit quantification of uncertainty around model performance, but thereby enables various sample size rules based on expected precision, assurance probabilities, and value of information.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures, 1 appendix</p></details> |

However, existing approaches struggle to perform well in graph-structured scenarios where user data is correlated, such as traffic flow prediction and social relationship recommender systems. In particular, graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches lead to expensive server communication cost. To address this problem, we propose GraphEdge, an efficient GNN-based EC architecture. It considers the EC system of GNN tasks, where there are associations between users and it needs to take into account the task data of its neighbors when processing the tasks of a user. Specifically, the architecture first perceives the user topology and represents their data associations as a graph layout at each time step. Then the graph layout is optimized by calling our proposed hierarchical traversal graph cut algorithm (HiCut), which cuts the graph layout into multiple weakly associated subgraphs based on the aggregation characteristics of GNN, and the communication cost between different subgraphs during GNN inference is minimized. Finally, based on the optimized graph layout, our proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based graph offloading algorithm (DRLGO) is executed to obtain the optimal offloading strategy for the tasks of users, the offloading strategy is subgraph-based, it tries to offload user tasks in a subgraph to the same edge server as possible while minimizing the task processing time and energy consumption of the EC system. Experimental results show the good effectiveness and dynamic adaptation of our proposed architecture and it also performs well even in dynamic scenarios.</p></details> | 17 pages,12 figures |
| **[DERD-Net: Learning Depth from Event-based Ray Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15863v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer a promising avenue for multi-view stereo depth estimation and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) due to their ability to detect blur-free 3D edges at high-speed and over broad illumination conditions. However, traditional deep learning frameworks designed for conventional cameras struggle with the asynchronous, stream-like nature of event data, as their architectures are optimized for discrete, image-like inputs. We propose a scalable, flexible and adaptable framework for pixel-wise depth estimation with event cameras in both monocular and stereo setups. The 3D scene structure is encoded into disparity space images (DSIs), representing spatial densities of rays obtained by back-projecting events into space via known camera poses. Our neural network processes local subregions of the DSIs combining 3D convolutions and a recurrent structure to recognize valuable patterns for depth prediction. Local processing enables fast inference with full parallelization and ensures constant ultra-low model complexity and memory costs, regardless of camera resolution. Experiments on standard benchmarks (MVSEC and DSEC datasets) demonstrate unprecedented effectiveness: (i) using purely monocular data, our method achieves comparable results to existing stereo methods; (ii) when applied to stereo data, it strongly outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, reducing the mean absolute error by at least 42%; (iii) our method also allows for increases in depth completeness by more than 3-fold while still yielding a reduction in median absolute error of at least 30%. Given its remarkable performance and effective processing of event-data, our framework holds strong potential to become a standard approach for using deep learning for event-based depth estimation and SLAM.

Despite extensive efforts and significant achievements in existing MASC, substantial gaps remain in understanding fine-grained visual content and the cognitive rationales derived from semantic content and impressions (cognitive interpretations of emotions evoked by image content). In this study, we present Chimera: a cognitive and aesthetic sentiment causality understanding framework to derive fine-grained holistic features of aspects and infer the fundamental drivers of sentiment expression from both semantic perspectives and affective-cognitive resonance (the synergistic effect between emotional responses and cognitive interpretations). Specifically, this framework first incorporates visual patch features for patch-word alignment. Meanwhile, it extracts coarse-grained visual features (e.g., overall image representation) and fine-grained visual regions (e.g., aspect-related regions) and translates them into corresponding textual descriptions (e.g., facial, aesthetic). Finally, we leverage the sentimental causes and impressions generated by a large language model (LLM) to enhance the model's awareness of sentimental cues evoked by semantic content and affective-cognitive resonance. Experimental results on standard MASC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which also exhibits greater flexibility to MASC compared to LLMs such as GPT-4o.

Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID\@. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures; fixed TeX formatting (v2)</p></details> |

Retrieving this information correctly is essential in financial Question-Answering (QA), since many language models struggle with factual accuracy in this domain. We present FinDER, an expert-generated dataset tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in finance. Unlike existing QA datasets that provide predefined contexts and rely on relatively clear and straightforward queries, FinDER focuses on annotating search-relevant evidence by domain experts, offering 5,703 query-evidence-answer triplets derived from real-world financial inquiries. These queries frequently include abbreviations, acronyms, and concise expressions, capturing the brevity and ambiguity common in the realistic search behavior of professionals. By challenging models to retrieve relevant information from large corpora rather than relying on readily determined contexts, FinDER offers a more realistic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems. We further present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art retrieval models and Large Language Models, showcasing challenges derived from a realistic benchmark to drive future research on truthful and precise RAG in the financial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, ICLR 2025 Workshop Advances in Financial AI</p></details> |

Additionally, Slipstream integrates a payment system that allows for fast UTXO transaction confirmation independently of block ordering. Transactions are confirmed in three rounds during synchrony, and unconfirmed double spends are resolved in a novel way using the DAG structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 3 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel operator inference approach for elliptic eigenvalue problems based on neural network approximations that directly maps computational domains to their associated eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Motivated by existing neural network architectures and the mathematical characteristics of eigenvalue problems, we represent computational domains as pixelated images and decompose the task into two subtasks: eigenvalue prediction and eigenfunction prediction. For the eigenvalue prediction, we design a convolutional neural network (CNN), while for the eigenfunction prediction, we employ a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Additionally, we introduce a critical preprocessing module that integrates domain scaling, detailed boundary pixelization, and main-axis alignment. This preprocessing step not only simplifies the learning task but also enhances the performance of the neural networks. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 21 pages, 13 figures |

Recent studies have explored transfer learning for independent observations in complex, high-dimensional models assuming sparsity, yet research on time series models remains limited. Our focus is on transfer learning for sequences of observations with temporal dependencies and a more intricate model parameter structure. Specifically, we investigate the vector autoregressive model (VAR), a widely recognized model for time series data, where the transition matrix can be deconstructed into a combination of a sparse matrix and a low-rank one. We propose a new transfer learning algorithm tailored for estimating high-dimensional VAR models characterized by low-rank and sparse structures. Additionally, we present a novel approach for selecting informative observations from auxiliary datasets. Theoretical guarantees are established, encompassing model parameter consistency, informative set selection, and the asymptotic distribution of estimators under mild conditions. The latter facilitates the construction of entry-wise confidence intervals for model parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical efficacy of our methodologies through both simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages accepted by AISTATS2025</p></details> |

The RISC-V "V" Vector Extension (RVV) enhances algorithm efficiency by supporting vector registers of dynamic sizes and their grouping. Nevertheless, for very long vectors, the static number of RVV vector registers and its power-of-two grouping can lead to performance restrictions. To counteract this limitation, this work introduces Zoozve, a RISC-V vector instruction extension that eliminates the need for strip-mining. Zoozve allows for flexible vector register length and count configurations to boost data computation parallelism. With a data-adaptive register allocation approach, Zoozve permits any register groupings and accurately aligns vector lengths, cutting down register overhead and alleviating performance declines from strip-mining. Additionally, the paper details Zoozve's compiler and hardware implementations using LLVM and SystemVerilog. Initial results indicate Zoozve yields a minimum 10.10$\times$ reduction in dynamic instruction count for fast Fourier transform (FFT), with a mere 5.2\% increase in overall silicon area.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, LCTES'25</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce Falcon, an innovative semi-autoregressive speculative decoding framework fashioned to augment both the drafter's parallelism and output quality. Falcon incorporates the Coupled Sequential Glancing Distillation technique, which fortifies inter-token dependencies within the same block, leading to increased speculation accuracy. We offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a Custom-Designed Decoding Tree, which permits the drafter to generate multiple tokens in a single forward pass and accommodates multiple forward passes as needed, thereby boosting the number of drafted tokens and significantly improving the overall acceptance rate. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K demonstrate Falcon's superior acceleration capabilities. The framework achieves a lossless speedup ratio ranging from 2.91x to 3.51x when tested on the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat model series. These results outstrip existing speculative decoding methods for LLMs, including Eagle, Medusa, Lookahead, SPS, and PLD, while maintaining a compact drafter architecture equivalent to merely two Transformer layers.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Accepted |

However, existing KT models often rely on a global forgetting decay mechanism for capturing learning patterns, assuming that students' performance is predominantly influenced by their most recent interactions. Such approaches fail to account for the diverse and complex learning patterns arising from individual differences and varying learning stages. To address this limitation, we propose RouterKT, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to capture heterogeneous learning patterns by enabling experts to specialize in different patterns without any handcrafted learning pattern bias such as forgetting decay. Specifically, RouterKT introduces a \textbf{person-wise routing mechanism} to effectively model individual-specific learning behaviors and employs \textbf{multi-heads as experts} to enhance the modeling of complex and diverse patterns. Comprehensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that RouterKT exhibits significant flexibility and improves the performance of various KT backbone models, with a maximum average AUC improvement of 3.29\% across different backbones and datasets, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, RouterKT demonstrates consistently superior inference efficiency compared to existing approaches based on handcrafted learning pattern bias, highlighting its usability for real-world educational applications.

The restricted form limits their generality and usability since these supervision signals are expensive and even infeasible to acquire in advance for unseen tasks. Learning directly from the raw text about decision tasks is a promising alternative to leverage a much broader source of supervision. In the paper, we propose Text-to-Decision Agent (T2DA), a simple and scalable framework that supervises generalist policy learning with natural language. We first introduce a generalized world model to encode multi-task decision data into a dynamics-aware embedding space. Then, inspired by CLIP, we predict which textual description goes with which decision embedding, effectively bridging their semantic gap via contrastive language-decision pre-training and aligning the text embeddings to comprehend the environment dynamics. After training the text-conditioned generalist policy, the agent can directly realize zero-shot text-to-decision generation in response to language instructions. Comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that T2DA facilitates high-capacity zero-shot generalization and outperforms various types of baselines.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Regional Tiny Stories: Using Small Models to Compare Language Learning and Tokenizer Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07989v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small Language Models (SLMs) offer efficient alternatives to LLMs for specific domains. The 2023 TinyStories study developed an English dataset that allows SLMs with 1 to 10 million parameters to produce coherent outputs. Our research expands this framework by translating the original dataset into Indian languages and creating synthetic data using LLMs. We focus on Hindi, Marathi, and Bengali, evaluating SLMs for regional language processing and understanding linguistic complexity. We show that SLMs efficiently process regional languages with significantly fewer parameters than LLMs, providing a complementary framework for ``inference based evaluation" of tokenization strategies and linguistic complexity. Our analysis shows that language-specific tokenizers outperform general-purpose ones for Indian languages. Empirical validations, supported by information-theoretic and morphological analyses, provides fundamental understanding behind the better performance of Hindi models over Marathi and Bengali. Additionally, we show that synthetic datasets outperform translated content for training SLMs. Correlation analyses reveal cross-linguistic patterns and language-specific relationships between creativity, grammatical precision, and narrative completeness. These findings advance both the practical application of SLMs to underserved languages and our theoretical understanding of neural language development.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 24 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Manipulating Multimodal Agents via Cross-Modal Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14348v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this work, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Bayesian Autoencoder for Medical Anomaly Detection: Uncertainty-Aware Approach for Brain 2 MRI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15562v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, anomaly detection is a vital element of healthcare diagnostics, especially for neurological conditions which can be life-threatening. Conventional deterministic methods often fall short when it comes to capturing the inherent uncertainty of anomaly detection tasks. This paper introduces a Bayesian Variational Autoencoder (VAE) equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms for detecting anomalies in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the purpose of improving anomaly detection performance, we incorporate both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation through Bayesian inference. The model was tested on the BraTS2020 dataset, and the findings were a 0.83 ROC AUC and a 0.83 PR AUC. The data in our paper suggests that modeling uncertainty is an essential component of anomaly detection, enhancing both performance and interpretability and providing confidence estimates, as well as anomaly predictions, for clinicians to leverage in making medical decisions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Vertical Federated Learning with Missing Features During Training and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22564v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical federated learning trains models from feature-partitioned datasets across multiple clients, who collaborate without sharing their local data. Standard approaches assume that all feature partitions are available during both training and inference. Yet, in practice, this assumption rarely holds, as for many samples only a subset of the clients observe their partition. However, not utilizing incomplete samples during training harms generalization, and not supporting them during inference limits the utility of the model. Moreover, if any client leaves the federation after training, its partition becomes unavailable, rendering the learned model unusable. Missing feature blocks are therefore a key challenge limiting the applicability of vertical federated learning in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose LASER-VFL, a vertical federated learning method for efficient training and inference of split neural network-based models that is capable of handling arbitrary sets of partitions. Our approach is simple yet effective, relying on the sharing of model parameters and on task-sampling to train a family of predictors. We show that LASER-VFL achieves a $\mathcal{O}({1}/{\sqrt{T}})$ convergence rate for nonconvex objectives and, under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, it achieves linear convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Numerical experiments show improved performance of LASER-VFL over the baselines. Remarkably, this is the case even in the absence of missing features. For example, for CIFAR-100, we see an improvement in accuracy of $19.3\%$ when each of four feature blocks is observed with a probability of 0.5 and of $9.5\%$ when all features are observed.

| **[HistLLM: A Unified Framework for LLM-Based Multimodal Recommendation with User History Encoding and Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10150v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in leveraging textual data for recommendations, their application to multimodal recommendation tasks remains relatively underexplored. Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wa...</summary><p>We want to withdraw this paper and revise its experimental details.

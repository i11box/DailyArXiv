| **[StableMTL: Repurposing Latent Diffusion Models for Multi-Task Learning from Partially Annotated Synthetic Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08013v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-task learning for dense prediction is limited by the need for extensive annotation for every task, though recent works have explored training with partial task labels. Leveraging the generalization power of diffusion models, we extend the partial learning setup to a zero-shot setting, training a multi-task model on multiple synthetic datasets, each labeled for only a subset of tasks. Our method, StableMTL, repurposes image generators for latent regression. Adapting a denoising framework with task encoding, per-task conditioning and a tailored training scheme. Instead of per-task losses requiring careful balancing, a unified latent loss is adopted, enabling seamless scaling to more tasks. To encourage inter-task synergy, we introduce a multi-stream model with a task-attention mechanism that converts N-to-N task interactions into efficient 1-to-N attention, promoting effective cross-task sharing. StableMTL outperforms baselines on 7 tasks across 8 benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/astra-vision/StableMTL</p></details> |
| **[4DGT: Learning a 4D Gaussian Transformer Using Real-World Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08015v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose 4DGT, a 4D Gaussian-based Transformer model for dynamic scene reconstruction, trained entirely on real-world monocular posed videos. Using 4D Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components, enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference, reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods on cross-domain videos.

| **[Vision Transformers Don't Need Trained Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08010v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the mechanism underlying a previously identified phenomenon in Vision Transformers -- the emergence of high-norm tokens that lead to noisy attention maps. We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and code: https://avdravid.github.io/test-time-registers</p></details> |
| **[Play to Generalize: Learning to Reason Through Game Play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08011v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing generalizable reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by cognitive science literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable cognitive skills, we propose a novel post-training paradigm, Visual Game Learning, or ViGaL, where MLLMs develop out-of-domain generalization of multimodal reasoning through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that post-training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple arcade-like games, e.g. Snake, significantly enhances its downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, and on multi-discipline questions like MMMU, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL, suggesting the capture of transferable reasoning skills. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models tuned on multimodal reasoning data in multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while preserving the base model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest a new post-training paradigm: synthetic, rule-based games can serve as controllable and scalable pre-text tasks that unlock generalizable multimodal reasoning abilities in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://yunfeixie233.github.io/ViGaL/</p></details> |
| **[GUI-Reflection: Empowering Multimodal GUI Models with Self-Reflection Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08012v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories, thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training, offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning. GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation. Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities, paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://penghao-wu.github.io/GUI_Reflection/</p></details> |
| **[Self Forcing: Bridging the Train-Test Gap in Autoregressive Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08009v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

| **[Hidden in plain sight: VLMs overlook their visual representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08008v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language provides a natural interface to specify and evaluate performance on visual tasks. To realize this possibility, vision language models (VLMs) must successfully integrate visual and linguistic information. Our work compares VLMs to a direct readout of their visual encoders to understand their ability to integrate across these modalities. Across a series of vision-centric benchmarks (e.g., depth estimation, correspondence), we find that VLMs perform substantially worse than their visual encoders, dropping to near-chance performance. We investigate these results through a series of analyses across the entire VLM: namely 1) the degradation of vision representations, 2) brittleness to task prompt, and 3) the language model's role in solving the task. We find that the bottleneck in performing these vision-centric tasks lies in this third category; VLMs are not effectively using visual information easily accessible throughout the entire model, and they inherit the language priors present in the LLM. Our work helps diagnose the failure modes of open-source VLMs, and presents a series of evaluations useful for future investigations into visual understanding within VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hidden-plain-sight.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Dreamland: Controllable World Creation with Simulator and Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08006v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generative models can synthesize diverse and realistic visual content for dynamic world creation, but they often lack element-wise controllability, hindering their use in editing scenes and training embodied AI agents. We propose Dreamland, a hybrid world generation framework combining the granular control of a physics-based simulator and the photorealistic content output of large-scale pretrained generative models. In particular, we design a layered world abstraction that encodes both pixel-level and object-level semantics and geometry as an intermediate representation to bridge the simulator and the generative model. This approach enhances controllability, minimizes adaptation cost through early alignment with real-world distributions, and supports off-the-shelf use of existing and future pretrained generative models. We further construct a D3Sim dataset to facilitate the training and evaluation of hybrid generation pipelines. Experiments demonstrate that Dreamland outperforms existing baselines with 50.8% improved image quality, 17.9% stronger controllability, and has great potential to enhance embodied agent training. Code and data will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://metadriverse.github.io/dreamland/</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic View Synthesis as an Inverse Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08004v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address dynamic view synthesis from monocular videos as an inverse problem in a training-free setting. By redesigning the noise initialization phase of a pre-trained video diffusion model, we enable high-fidelity dynamic view synthesis without any weight updates or auxiliary modules. We begin by identifying a fundamental obstacle to deterministic inversion arising from zero-terminal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) schedules and resolve it by introducing a novel noise representation, termed K-order Recursive Noise Representation. We derive a closed form expression for this representation, enabling precise and efficient alignment between the VAE-encoded and the DDIM inverted latents. To synthesize newly visible regions resulting from camera motion, we introduce Stochastic Latent Modulation, which performs visibility aware sampling over the latent space to complete occluded regions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic view synthesis can be effectively performed through structured latent manipulation in the noise initialization phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://inverse-dvs.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Aligning Text, Images, and 3D Structure Token-by-Token](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08002v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating machines capable of understanding the world in 3D is essential in assisting designers that build and edit 3D environments and robots navigating and interacting within a three-dimensional space. Inspired by advances in language and image modeling, we investigate the potential of autoregressive models for a new modality: structured 3D scenes. To this end, we propose a unified LLM framework that aligns language, images, and 3D scenes and provide a detailed ''cookbook'' outlining critical design choices for achieving optimal training and performance addressing key questions related to data representation, modality-specific objectives, and more. We evaluate performance across four core 3D tasks -- rendering, recognition, instruction-following, and question-answering -- and four 3D datasets, synthetic and real-world. We extend our approach to reconstruct complex 3D object shapes by enriching our 3D modality with quantized shape encodings, and show our model's effectiveness on real-world 3D object recognition tasks.

| **[Reparameterized LLM Training via Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08001v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) are driving the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, effectively and reliably training these large models remains one of the field's most significant challenges. To address this challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically, POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and scalability of POET in training LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report v1 (36 pages, 24 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/poet-site/)</p></details> |
| **[E3D-Bench: A Benchmark for End-to-End 3D Geometric Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01933v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core 3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://e3dbench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling of Weights: Generalization or Memorization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07998v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model, and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new domains.

| **[UA-Pose: Uncertainty-Aware 6D Object Pose Estimation and Online Object Completion with Partial References](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07996v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>6D object pose estimation has shown strong generalizability to novel objects. However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods, particularly when object observations are incomplete or partially captured.

| **[PhantomWiki: On-Demand Datasets for Reasoning and Retrieval Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20377v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality benchmarks are essential for evaluating reasoning and retrieval capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, curating datasets for this purpose is not a permanent solution as they are prone to data leakage and inflated performance results. To address these challenges, we propose PhantomWiki: a pipeline to generate unique, factually consistent document corpora with diverse question-answer pairs. Unlike prior work, PhantomWiki is neither a fixed dataset, nor is it based on any existing data. Instead, a new PhantomWiki instance is generated on demand for each evaluation. We vary the question difficulty and corpus size to disentangle reasoning and retrieval capabilities respectively, and find that PhantomWiki datasets are surprisingly challenging for frontier LLMs. Thus, we contribute a scalable and data leakage-resistant framework for disentangled evaluation of reasoning, retrieval, and tool-use abilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/kilian-group/phantom-wiki.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Unraveling Ethereum's Mempool: The Impact of Fee Fairness, Transaction Prioritization, and Consensus Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07988v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ethereum's transaction pool (mempool) dynamics and fee market efficiency critically affect transaction inclusion, validator workload, and overall network performance. This research empirically analyzes gas price variations, mempool clearance rates, and block finalization times in Ethereum's proof-of-stake ecosystem using real-time data from Geth and Prysm nodes. We observe that high-fee transactions are consistently prioritized, while low-fee transactions face delays or exclusion despite EIP-1559's intended improvements. Mempool congestion remains a key factor in validator efficiency and proposal latency. We provide empirical evidence of persistent fee-based disparities and show that extremely high fees do not always guarantee faster confirmation, revealing inefficiencies in the current fee market. To address these issues, we propose congestion-aware fee adjustments, reserved block slots for low-fee transactions, and improved handling of out-of-gas vulnerabilities. By mitigating prioritization bias and execution inefficiencies, our findings support more equitable transaction inclusion, enhance validator performance, and promote scalability. This work contributes to Ethereum's long-term decentralization by reducing dependence on high transaction fees for network participation.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

It tackles challenges in open long-tailed lung disease classification and enhances the measurability of state-of-the-art techniques. The first event, CXR-LT 2023, aimed to achieve these goals by providing high-quality benchmark CXR data for model development and conducting comprehensive evaluations to identify ongoing issues impacting lung disease classification performance. Building on the success of CXR-LT 2023, the CXR-LT 2024 expands the dataset to 377,110 chest X-rays (CXRs) and 45 disease labels, including 19 new rare disease findings. It also introduces a new focus on zero-shot learning to address limitations identified in the previous event. Specifically, CXR-LT 2024 features three tasks: (i) long-tailed classification on a large, noisy test set, (ii) long-tailed classification on a manually annotated "gold standard" subset, and (iii) zero-shot generalization to five previously unseen disease findings. This paper provides an overview of CXR-LT 2024, detailing the data curation process and consolidating state-of-the-art solutions, including the use of multimodal models for rare disease detection, advanced generative approaches to handle noisy labels, and zero-shot learning strategies for unseen diseases. Additionally, the expanded dataset enhances disease coverage to better represent real-world clinical settings, offering a valuable resource for future research. By synthesizing the insights and innovations of participating teams, we aim to advance the development of clinically realistic and generalizable diagnostic models for chest radiography.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |

In contrast to previous work, our approach introduces a multi-mode state model with $W$ discrete modes to significantly accelerate optimization while preserving centimeter-level accuracy -- even in cases of severe occlusion, motion blur, and complex backgrounds. The system operates on standard CPUs and achieves low latency suitable for live broadcast settings. Extensive evaluation on a proprietary dataset of 6K-resolution Russian Premier League matches demonstrates performance comparable to multi-camera systems, without the need for specialized or costly infrastructure. This work provides a practical method for accessible and accurate 3D ball tracking in professional football environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Realistic Urban Traffic Generator using Decentralized Federated Learning for the SUMO simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07980v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic urban traffic simulation is essential for sustainable urban planning and the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, generating high-fidelity, time-varying traffic profiles that accurately reflect real-world conditions, especially in large-scale scenarios, remains a major challenge. Existing methods often suffer from limitations in accuracy, scalability, or raise privacy concerns due to centralized data processing. This work introduces DesRUTGe (Decentralized Realistic Urban Traffic Generator), a novel framework that integrates Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents with the SUMO simulator to generate realistic 24-hour traffic patterns. A key innovation of DesRUTGe is its use of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL), wherein each traffic detector and its corresponding urban zone function as an independent learning node. These nodes train local DRL models using minimal historical data and collaboratively refine their performance by exchanging model parameters with selected peers (e.g., geographically adjacent zones), without requiring a central coordinator. Evaluated using real-world data from the city of Barcelona, DesRUTGe outperforms standard SUMO-based tools such as RouteSampler, as well as other centralized learning approaches, by delivering more accurate and privacy-preserving traffic pattern generation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

Online platforms employ a range of RecSys techniques to personalize user experience across diverse in-app surfaces. User representations are often learned individually through user's historical interactions within each surface and user representations across different surfaces can be shared post-hoc as auxiliary features or additional retrieval sources. While effective, such schemes cannot directly encode collaborative filtering signals across different surfaces, hindering its capacity to discover complex relationships between user behaviors and preferences across the whole platform. To bridge this gap at Snapchat, we seek to conduct universal user modeling (UUM) across different in-app surfaces, learning general-purpose user representations which encode behaviors across surfaces. Instead of replacing domain-specific representations, UUM representations capture cross-domain trends, enriching existing representations with complementary information. This work discusses our efforts in developing initial UUM versions, practical challenges, technical choices and modeling and research directions with promising offline performance. Following successful A/B testing, UUM representations have been launched in production, powering multiple use cases and demonstrating their value. UUM embedding has been incorporated into (i) Long-form Video embedding-based retrieval, leading to 2.78% increase in Long-form Video Open Rate, (ii) Long-form Video L2 ranking, with 19.2% increase in Long-form Video View Time sum, (iii) Lens L2 ranking, leading to 1.76% increase in Lens play time, and (iv) Notification L2 ranking, with 0.87% increase in Notification Open Rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the industrial track of SIGIR'25</p></details> |

These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed `hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for a given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional hyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains uncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model sets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to discover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy. However, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally expensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early comparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of post-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard hyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning framework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH). LSH reduces search time by an order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches relying on full training. Experiments on stacked LSTM and RHN architectures using the Penn Treebank dataset, and on AWD-LSTM-MoS using WikiText-2, demonstrate that under fixed training budgets and target pruning ratios, LSH consistently identifies superior pruned models. Remarkably, these pruned variants not only outperform those selected by loss-based baseline but also exceed the performance of their dense counterpart.</p></details> | 26 pages, 3 figures |

However, this surge in popularity has also given rise to a disturbing trend: the emergence of rug pulls - fraudulent schemes where developers exploit trust and smart contract privileges to drain user funds or invalidate asset ownership. Central to many of these scams are hidden backdoors embedded within NFT smart contracts. Unlike unintentional bugs, these backdoors are deliberately coded and often obfuscated to bypass traditional audits and exploit investor confidence. In this paper, we present a large-scale static analysis of 49,940 verified NFT smart contracts using Slither, a static analysis framework, to uncover latent vulnerabilities commonly linked to rug pulls. We introduce a custom risk scoring model that classifies contracts into high, medium, or low risk tiers based on the presence and severity of rug pull indicators. Our dataset was derived from verified contracts on the Ethereum mainnet, and we generate multiple visualizations to highlight red flag clusters, issue prevalence, and co-occurrence of critical vulnerabilities. While we do not perform live exploits, our results reveal how malicious patterns often missed by simple reviews can be surfaced through static analysis at scale. We conclude by offering mitigation strategies for developers, marketplaces, and auditors to enhance smart contract security. By exposing how hidden backdoors manifest in real-world smart contracts, this work contributes a practical foundation for detecting and mitigating NFT rug pulls through scalable automated analysis.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 4 Figures |
| **[MIB: A Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13151v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we know whether new mechanistic interpretability methods achieve real improvements? In pursuit of lasting evaluation standards, we propose MIB, a Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark, with two tracks spanning four tasks and five models. MIB favors methods that precisely and concisely recover relevant causal pathways or causal variables in neural language models. The circuit localization track compares methods that locate the model components - and connections between them - most important for performing a task (e.g., attribution patching or information flow routes). The causal variable localization track compares methods that featurize a hidden vector, e.g., sparse autoencoders (SAEs) or distributed alignment search (DAS), and align those features to a task-relevant causal variable. Using MIB, we find that attribution and mask optimization methods perform best on circuit localization. For causal variable localization, we find that the supervised DAS method performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons, i.e., non-featurized hidden vectors.

| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on over 350 LLMs overall, using two popular leaderboards and a resume-screening task. We find substantial correlation in model errors -- on one leaderboard dataset, models agree 60% of the time when both models err. We identify factors driving model correlation, including shared architectures and providers. Crucially, however, larger and more accurate models have highly correlated errors, even with distinct architectures and providers. Finally, we show the effects of correlation in two downstream tasks: LLM-as-judge evaluation and hiring -- the latter reflecting theoretical predictions regarding algorithmic monoculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[BridgeVLA: Input-Output Alignment for Efficient 3D Manipulation Learning with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07961v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) for building vision-language-action (VLA) models has emerged as a promising approach to effective robot manipulation learning. However, only few methods incorporate 3D signals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the spatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In this paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D inputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone, and (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and output spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a scalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability to predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments show the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and effectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across three simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate from 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better performance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average success rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing baseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments, BridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It generalizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual disturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a success rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task, highlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

| **[Language Models over Canonical Byte-Pair Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07956v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models represent probability distributions over character strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several models and corpora.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing factual and logical correctness in downstream tasks, with limited emphasis on evaluating MLLMs' ability to interpret pragmatic cues and intermodal relationships. To address this gap, we assess the competency of MLLMs in performing Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA) using Coherence Relations. Our benchmark, CORDIAL, encompasses a broad spectrum of Coherence Relations across 3 different discourse domains at varying levels of granularity. Through our experiments on 10+ MLLMs employing different prompting strategies, we show that even top models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o fail to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines. This study emphasizes the need to move beyond similarity-based metrics and adopt a discourse-driven framework for evaluating MLLMs, providing a more nuanced assessment of their capabilities.

State-Change Counterfactuals for Procedure-Aware Video Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21055v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by proposing novel approaches such as modeling the temporal order of actions, and has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if'' scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks. We will make our source code and data publicly available soon.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

Aiming to address this limitation, we present Easy2Hard-Bench, a consistently formatted collection of 6 benchmark datasets spanning various domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions. Each problem within these datasets is annotated with numerical difficulty scores. To systematically estimate problem difficulties, we collect abundant performance data on attempts to each problem by humans in the real world or LLMs on the prominent leaderboard. Leveraging the rich performance data, we apply well-established difficulty ranking systems, such as Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign numerical difficulty scores to problems. Moreover, datasets in Easy2Hard-Bench distinguish themselves from previous collections by a higher proportion of challenging problems. Through extensive experiments with six state-of-the-art LLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their performance and generalization capabilities across varying levels of difficulty, with the aim of inspiring future research in LLM generalization.

| **[Statistical Hypothesis Testing for Auditing Robustness in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07947v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model (LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist, they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.00868</p></details> |

In contrast, their applicability for hardware description languages, particularly for generating synthesizable and functionally correct designs, remains significantly underexplored. HDLs such as SystemVerilog are logic-oriented and demand strict adherence to timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability constraints. Moreover, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks beyond structural code generation, including testbench development, assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration for on-chip communication. The objective of our paper is to analyze the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating SystemVerilog implementations of standard communication protocols, a core component of embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. This paper introduces the first benchmark suite targeting four widely used protocols: SPI, I2C, UART, and AXI. We define code generation tasks that capture varying levels of design abstraction and prompt specificity. The generated designs are assessed for syntactic correctness, synthesizability, and functional fidelity via waveform simulation and test benches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MLSysArch@ISCA 2025</p></details> |

To enhance caption diversity, it is essential to explore alternative ways of communicating these messages in conjunction with visual content. We propose RONA, a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) that leverages Coherence Relations as a controllable axis for pragmatic variations.

| **[Predicting Situation Awareness from Physiological Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07930v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Situation awareness (SA)--comprising the ability to 1) perceive critical elements in the environment, 2) comprehend their meanings, and 3) project their future states--is critical for human operator performance. Due to the disruptive nature of gold-standard SA measures, researchers have sought physiological indicators to provide real-time information about SA. We extend prior work by using a multimodal suite of neurophysiological, psychophysiological, and behavioral signals, predicting all three levels of SA along a continuum, and predicting a comprehensive measure of SA in a complex multi-tasking simulation. We present a lab study in which 31 participants controlled an aircraft simulator task battery while wearing physiological sensors and responding to SA 'freeze-probe' assessments. We demonstrate the validity of task and assessment for measuring SA. Multimodal physiological models predict SA with greater predictive performance ($Q^2$ for levels 1-3 and total, respectively: 0.14, 0.00, 0.26, and 0.36) than models built with shuffled labels, demonstrating that multimodal physiological signals provide useful information in predicting all SA levels. Level 3 SA (projection) was best predicted, and level 2 SA comprehension) was the most challenging to predict. Ablation analysis and single sensor models found EEG and eye-tracking signals to be particularly useful to predictions of level 3 and total SA. A reduced sensor fusion model showed that predictive performance can be maintained with a subset of sensors. This first rigorous cross-validation assessment of predictive performance demonstrates the utility of multimodal physiological signals for inferring complex, holistic, objective measures of SA at all levels, non-disruptively, and along a continuum.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems</p></details> |

Using 4D Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components, enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference, reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods on cross-domain videos.

We observe that in multiple models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2), a sparse set of neurons is responsible for concentrating high-norm activations on outlier tokens, leading to irregular attention patterns and degrading downstream visual processing. While the existing solution for removing these outliers involves retraining models from scratch with additional learned register tokens, we use our findings to create a training-free approach to mitigate these artifacts. By shifting the high-norm activations from our discovered register neurons into an additional untrained token, we can mimic the effect of register tokens on a model already trained without registers. We demonstrate that our method produces cleaner attention and feature maps, enhances performance over base models across multiple downstream visual tasks, and achieves results comparable to models explicitly trained with register tokens. We then extend test-time registers to off-the-shelf vision-language models to improve their interpretability. Our results suggest that test-time registers effectively take on the role of register tokens at test-time, offering a training-free solution for any pre-trained model released without them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and code: https://avdravid.github.io/test-time-registers</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose POET, a novel reParameterized training algorithm that uses Orthogonal Equivalence Transformation to optimize neurons. Specifically, POET reparameterizes each neuron with two learnable orthogonal matrices and a fixed random weight matrix. Because of its provable preservation of spectral properties of weight matrices, POET can stably optimize the objective function with improved generalization. We further develop efficient approximations that make POET flexible and scalable for training large-scale neural networks.

However, performing per-Gaussian neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper, we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses. Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by $7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset. SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://speede3dgs.github.io/</p></details> |

We propose self-questioning as a lightweight and scalable strategy to improve LLMs' understanding, particularly in domains where success depends on fine-grained semantic distinctions. To evaluate this approach, we introduce a challenging new benchmark of 1.3 million post-2015 computer science patent pairs, characterized by dense technical jargon and strategically complex writing. The benchmark centers on a pairwise differentiation task: can a model distinguish between closely related but substantively different inventions? We show that compared to placebo scientific information, prompting LLMs to generate and answer their own questions - targeting the background knowledge required for the task - significantly improves performance. These self-generated questions and answers activate otherwise underutilized internal knowledge. Allowing LLMs to retrieve answers from external scientific texts further enhances performance, suggesting that model knowledge is compressed and lacks the full richness of the training data. We also find that chain-of-thought prompting and self-questioning converge, though self-questioning remains more effective for improving understanding of technical concepts. Notably, we uncover an asymmetry in prompting: smaller models often generate more fundamental, more open-ended, better-aligned questions for mid-sized models than large models do, revealing a new strategy for cross-model collaboration. Altogether, our findings establish self-questioning as both a practical mechanism for automatically improving LLM comprehension, especially in domains with sparse and underrepresented knowledge, and a diagnostic probe of how internal and external knowledge are organized.</p></details> | <details><summary>We op...</summary><p>We open-source our patent dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/UchiKlab/patent_understanding</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Numeric Rewards: In-Context Dueling Bandits with LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01887v4)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) is a frontier paradigm to solve Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems in the foundation model era. While ICRL capabilities have been demonstrated in transformers through task-specific training, the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLMs can generalize cross-domain to perform ICRL under the problem of Dueling Bandits (DB), a stateless preference-based RL setting. We find that the top-performing LLMs exhibit a notable zero-shot capacity for relative decision-making, which translates to low short-term weak regret across all DB environment instances by quickly including the best arm in duels. However, an optimality gap still exists between LLMs and classic DB algorithms in terms of strong regret. LLMs struggle to converge and consistently exploit even when explicitly prompted to do so, and are sensitive to prompt variations. To bridge this gap, we propose an agentic flow framework: LLM with Enhanced Algorithmic Dueling (LEAD), which integrates off-the-shelf DB algorithm support with LLM agents through fine-grained adaptive interplay. We show that LEAD has theoretical guarantees inherited from classic DB algorithms on both weak and strong regret. We validate its efficacy and robustness even with noisy and adversarial prompts. The design of such an agentic framework sheds light on how to enhance the trustworthiness of general-purpose LLMs generalized to in-context decision-making tasks.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

These documents often span different regions and project scales, covering multiple domains of expertise. This process traditionally demands immense time and specialized knowledge from decision-makers. The advent of Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches offer a transformative solution, enabling rapid, accurate cross-document information retrieval and synthesis. As the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text generation continues to evolve, benchmarking becomes essential to evaluate and compare the performance of different RAG-based LLMs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to generate a domain relevant RAG benchmark. Our framework is based on automatic question-answer generation with Human (domain experts)-AI (LLM) teaming. As a case study, we demonstrate the framework by introducing WeQA, a first-of-its-kind benchmark on the wind energy domain which comprises of multiple scientific documents/reports related to environmental aspects of wind energy projects. Our framework systematically evaluates RAG performance using diverse metrics and multiple question types with varying complexity level, providing a foundation for rigorous assessment of RAG-based systems in complex scientific domains and enabling researchers to identify areas for improvement in domain-specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages without Limitation and References</p></details> |

Despite their remarkable success, it remains unclear how these architectures represent features internally. Here, we propose a novel approach for interpreting vision features via image reconstruction. We compare two related model families, SigLIP and SigLIP2, which differ only in their training objective, and show that encoders pre-trained on image-based tasks retain significantly more image information than those trained on non-image tasks such as contrastive learning. We further apply our method to a range of vision encoders, ranking them by the informativeness of their feature representations. Finally, we demonstrate that manipulating the feature space yields predictable changes in reconstructed images, revealing that orthogonal rotations (rather than spatial transformations) control color encoding. Our approach can be applied to any vision encoder, shedding light on the inner structure of its feature space. The code and model weights to reproduce the experiments are available in GitHub.</p></details> | 23 pages, 14 figures |

It requires simultaneous capture of both phenological dynamics (obtained from multi-temporal satellite data like Sentinel-2) and subtle spectral variations (demanding nanometer-scale spectral resolution from hyperspectral imagery). Research combining these two modalities remains scarce currently due to challenges in hyperspectral data acquisition and crop types annotation costs. To address these issues, we construct a hierarchical hyperspectral crop dataset (H2Crop) by integrating 30m-resolution EnMAP hyperspectral data with Sentinel-2 time series. With over one million annotated field parcels organized in a four-tier crop taxonomy, H2Crop establishes a vital benchmark for fine-grained agricultural crop classification and hyperspectral image processing. We propose a dual-stream Transformer architecture that synergistically processes these modalities. It coordinates two specialized pathways: a spectral-spatial Transformer extracts fine-grained signatures from hyperspectral EnMAP data, while a temporal Swin Transformer extracts crop growth patterns from Sentinel-2 time series. The designed hierarchical classification head with hierarchical fusion then simultaneously delivers multi-level crop type classification across all taxonomic tiers. Experiments demonstrate that adding hyperspectral EnMAP data to Sentinel-2 time series yields a 4.2% average F1-scores improvement (peaking at 6.3%). Extensive comparisons also confirm our method's higher accuracy over existing deep learning approaches for crop type classification and the consistent benefits of hyperspectral data across varying temporal windows and crop change scenarios.

However, traditional monostatic and localizationbased sensing methods face challenges in fusing sensing results and matching channel parameters. To address these challenges, we model low-altitude surveillance as a compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging problem by leveraging the cooperation of multiple base stations and the inherent sparsity of aerial images. Additionally, we derive the point spread function to analyze the influences of different antenna, subcarrier, and resolution settings on the imaging performance. Given the random spatial distribution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we propose a physics-embedded learning method to mitigate off-grid errors in traditional CS-based approaches. Furthermore, to enhance rare UAV detection in vast low-altitude airspace, we integrate an online hard example mining scheme into the loss function design, enabling the network to adaptively focus on samples with significant discrepancies from the ground truth during training. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed low-altitude surveillance framework. The proposed physicsembedded learning algorithm achieves a 97.55% detection rate, significantly outperforming traditional CS-based methods under off-grid conditions.

| **[MIRIAD: Augmenting LLMs with millions of medical query-response pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06091v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are bound to transform healthcare with advanced decision support and flexible chat assistants. However, LLMs are prone to generate inaccurate medical content. To ground LLMs in high-quality medical knowledge, LLMs have been equipped with external knowledge via RAG, where unstructured medical knowledge is split into small text chunks that can be selectively retrieved and integrated into the LLMs context. Yet, existing RAG pipelines rely on raw, unstructured medical text, which can be noisy, uncurated and difficult for LLMs to effectively leverage. Systematic approaches to organize medical knowledge to best surface it to LLMs are generally lacking. To address these challenges, we introduce MIRIAD, a large-scale, curated corpus of 5,821,948 medical QA pairs, each rephrased from and grounded in a passage from peer-reviewed medical literature using a semi-automated pipeline combining LLM generation, filtering, grounding, and human annotation. Unlike prior medical corpora, which rely on unstructured text, MIRIAD encapsulates web-scale medical knowledge in an operationalized query-response format, which enables more targeted retrieval. Experiments on challenging medical QA benchmarks show that augmenting LLMs with MIRIAD improves accuracy up to 6.7% compared to unstructured RAG baselines with the same source corpus and with the same amount of retrieved text. Moreover, MIRIAD improved the ability of LLMs to detect medical hallucinations by 22.5 to 37% (increase in F1 score). We further introduce MIRIAD-Atlas, an interactive map of MIRIAD spanning 56 medical disciplines, enabling clinical users to visually explore, search, and refine medical knowledge. MIRIAD promises to unlock a wealth of down-stream applications, including medical information retrievers, enhanced RAG applications, and knowledge-grounded chat interfaces, which ultimately enables more reliable LLM applications in healthcare.</p></details> | Preprint |

Traditionally, this exercise involves careful curation of datasets and repeated fine-tuning of the underlying model. Fine-tuning techniques enable practitioners to adapt foundation models for many new applications but require expensive and lengthy training while being notably sensitive to hyperparameter choices. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Text-to-LoRA (T2L), a model capable of adapting large language models (LLMs) on the fly solely based on a natural language description of the target task. T2L is a hypernetwork trained to construct LoRAs in a single inexpensive forward pass. After training T2L on a suite of 9 pre-trained LoRA adapters (GSM8K, Arc, etc.), we show that the ad-hoc reconstructed LoRA instances match the performance of task-specific adapters across the corresponding test sets. Furthermore, T2L can compress hundreds of LoRA instances and zero-shot generalize to entirely unseen tasks. This approach provides a significant step towards democratizing the specialization of foundation models and enables language-based adaptation with minimal compute requirements.

However, concerns over their empirical effectiveness, scalability, and complexity of the pre-processing steps have been raised, especially in relation to much simpler graph neural networks that typically perform on par with them across a wide range of benchmarks. To tackle these shortcomings, we consider graphs as sets of edges and propose a purely attention-based approach consisting of an encoder and an attention pooling mechanism. The encoder vertically interleaves masked and vanilla self-attention modules to learn an effective representations of edges, while allowing for tackling possible misspecifications in input graphs. Despite its simplicity, the approach outperforms fine-tuned message passing baselines and recently proposed transformer-based methods on more than 70 node and graph-level tasks, including challenging long-range benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across different tasks, ranging from molecular to vision graphs, and heterophilous node classification. The approach also outperforms graph neural networks and transformers in transfer learning settings, and scales much better than alternatives with a similar performance level or expressive power.</p></details> | <details><summary>Now p...</summary><p>Now published in Nature Communications</p></details> |
| **[Language Embedding Meets Dynamic Graph: A New Exploration for Neural Architecture Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07735v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Architecture Representation Learning aims to transform network models into feature representations for predicting network attributes, playing a crucial role in deploying and designing networks for real-world applications. Recently, inspired by the success of transformers, transformer-based models integrated with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant progress in representation learning. However, current methods still have some limitations. First, existing methods overlook hardware attribute information, which conflicts with the current trend of diversified deep learning hardware and limits the practical applicability of models. Second, current encoding approaches rely on static adjacency matrices to represent topological structures, failing to capture the structural differences between computational nodes, which ultimately compromises encoding effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce LeDG-Former, an innovative framework that addresses these limitations through the synergistic integration of language-based semantic embedding and dynamic graph representation learning. Specifically, inspired by large language models (LLMs), we propose a language embedding framework where both neural architectures and hardware platform specifications are projected into a unified semantic space through tokenization and LLM processing, enabling zero-shot prediction across different hardware platforms for the first time. Then, we propose a dynamic graph-based transformer for modeling neural architectures, resulting in improved neural architecture modeling performance. On the NNLQP benchmark, LeDG-Former surpasses previous methods, establishing a new SOTA while demonstrating the first successful cross-hardware latency prediction capability. Furthermore, our framework achieves superior performance on the cell-structured NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201 datasets.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05526v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Feature-Based Lie Group Transformer for Real-World Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04668v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main goal of representation learning is to acquire meaningful representations from real-world sensory inputs without supervision. Representation learning explains some aspects of human development. Various neural network (NN) models have been proposed that acquire empirically good representations. However, the formulation of a good representation has not been established. We recently proposed a method for categorizing changes between a pair of sensory inputs. A unique feature of this approach is that transformations between two sensory inputs are learned to satisfy algebraic structural constraints. Conventional representation learning often assumes that disentangled independent feature axes is a good representation; however, we found that such a representation cannot account for conditional independence. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new method using group decomposition in Galois algebra theory. Although this method is promising for defining a more general representation, it assumes pixel-to-pixel translation without feature extraction, and can only process low-resolution images with no background, which prevents real-world application. In this study, we provide a simple method to apply our group decomposition theory to a more realistic scenario by combining feature extraction and object segmentation. We replace pixel translation with feature translation and formulate object segmentation as grouping features under the same transformation. We validated the proposed method on a practical dataset containing both real-world object and background. We believe that our model will lead to a better understanding of human development of object recognition in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, the dataset used in this work is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RaSWNN2GEyV3zQPeGya4Mr9DDhJ7OMz7/view?usp=sharing</p></details> |

An Investigation of Tokenization Effects on Sequential Language Models for Nepali](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18071v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impact of subword tokenization on language model performance is well-documented for perplexity, with finer granularity consistently reducing this intrinsic metric. However, research on how different tokenization schemes affect a model's understanding capabilities remains limited, particularly for non-Latin script languages. Addressing this gap, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of six distinct tokenization strategies by pretraining transformer-based language models for Nepali and evaluating their performance across multiple downstream tasks. While recent prominent models like GPT, RoBERTa, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon, and MPT have adopted byte-level BPE tokenization, our findings demonstrate that for Nepali, SentencePiece tokenization consistently yields superior results on understanding-based tasks. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on BERT-based architectures, our research specifically examines sequential transformer models, providing valuable insights for language model development in low-resource languages and highlighting the importance of tokenization strategy beyond perplexity reduction.</p></details> | 11 pages |

To address this challenge, we design a novel AI-based framework that automates cable connector mating by integrating force control with deep visuotactile learning. Our system optimizes search-and-insertion strategies using first-order optimization over a multimodal transformer architecture trained on visual, tactile, and proprioceptive data. Additionally, we design a novel automated data collection and optimization pipeline that minimizes the need for machine learning expertise. The framework optimizes robot programs that run natively on standard industrial controllers, permitting human experts to audit and certify them.

Their effectiveness can mainly be attributed to their ability to adapt to an array of downstream tasks. However, generally, full fine-tuning is a computationally expensive job. To mitigate this, many techniques have been developed that prime efficiency, a prominent one being Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). However, LoRA and its variants employ re-parametrized additive updates. In this paper, we propose Low-Rank Multiplicative Adaptation (LoRMA), which shifts the paradigm of additive updates to a richer space of matrix multiplicative transformations. We tackle challenges such as computational complexity and rank bottleneck of matrix multiplication by effectively re-ordering operations and introducing rank inflation strategies. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of various evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL Findings 2025; 21 pages (9 main paper + 5 pages references + 7 pages appendix)</p></details> |
| **[Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance with Nonlinear Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00968v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-Sliced methods have recently emerged as an alternative to the traditional Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, replacing one-dimensional lines with tree-based metric spaces and incorporating a splitting mechanism for projecting measures. This approach enhances the ability to capture the topological structures of integration domains in Sliced Optimal Transport while maintaining low computational costs. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel nonlinear projectional framework for the Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (TSW) distance, substituting the linear projections in earlier versions with general projections, while ensuring the injectivity of the associated Radon Transform and preserving the well-definedness of the resulting metric. By designing appropriate projections, we construct efficient metrics for measures on both Euclidean spaces and spheres. Finally, we validate our proposed metric through extensive numerical experiments for Euclidean and spherical datasets. Applications include gradient flows, self-supervised learning, and generative models, where our methods demonstrate significant improvements over recent SW and TSW variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance: A Geometric Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13725v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many variants of Optimal Transport (OT) have been developed to address its heavy computation. Among them, notably, Sliced Wasserstein (SW) is widely used for application domains by projecting the OT problem onto one-dimensional lines, and leveraging the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden. However, projecting measures onto low-dimensional spaces can lead to a loss of topological information. To mitigate this issue, in this work, we propose to replace one-dimensional lines with a more intricate structure, called tree systems. This structure is metrizable by a tree metric, which yields a closed-form expression for OT problems on tree systems. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to formally define tree systems with their topological properties, introduce the concept of splitting maps, which operate as the projection mechanism onto these structures, then finally propose a novel variant of Radon transform for tree systems and verify its injectivity. This framework leads to an efficient metric between measures, termed Tree-Sliced Wasserstein distance on Systems of Lines (TSW-SL). By conducting a variety of experiments on gradient flows, image style transfer, and generative models, we illustrate that our proposed approach performs favorably compared to SW and its variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we propose ParallelComp, a parallel long-context compression method that effectively overcomes the memory bottleneck, enabling 8B-parameter LLMs to extrapolate from 8K to 128K tokens on a single A100 80GB GPU in a training-free setting. ParallelComp splits the input into chunks, dynamically evicting redundant chunks and irrelevant tokens, supported by a parallel KV cache eviction mechanism. Importantly, we present a systematic theoretical and empirical analysis of attention biases in parallel attention-including the attention sink, recency bias, and middle bias-and reveal that these biases exhibit distinctive patterns under ultra-long context settings. We further design a KV cache eviction technique to mitigate this phenomenon. Experimental results show that ParallelComp enables an 8B model (trained on 8K context) to achieve 91.17% of GPT-4's performance under ultra-long contexts, outperforming closed-source models such as Claude-2 and Kimi-Chat. We achieve a 1.76x improvement in chunk throughput, thereby achieving a 23.50x acceleration in the prefill stage with negligible performance loss and pave the way for scalable and robust ultra-long contexts extrapolation in LLMs. We release the code at https://github.com/menik1126/ParallelComp.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Remote sensing can help mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, bi-temporal methods are limited for continuous urban change detection, i.e., the detection of changes in consecutive image pairs of satellite image time series (SITS), as they fail to fully exploit multi-temporal data (> 2 images). Existing multi-temporal change detection methods, on the other hand, collapse the temporal dimension, restricting their ability to capture continuous urban changes. Additionally, multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To address these challenges, we propose a continuous urban change detection framework incorporating two key modules. The temporal feature refinement (TFR) module employs self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. The temporal dimension is preserved in the TFR module, enabling the detection of continuous changes. The multi-task integration (MTI) module utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed framework effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551), Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440), and WorldView-2 (F1 score 0.543). Moreover, our experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |

To address this, we present LetsTalk, a LinEar diffusion TranSformer for Talking video synthesis. LetsTalk incorporates a deep compression autoencoder to obtain efficient latent representations, and a spatio-temporal-aware transformer with efficient linear attention to effectively fuse multimodal information and enhance spatio-temporal consistency. We systematically explore and summarize three fusion schemes, ranging from shallow to deep fusion. We thoroughly analyze their characteristics, applicability, and trade-offs, thereby bridging critical gaps in multimodal conditional guidance. Based on modality differences of image, audio, and video generation, we adopt deep (Symbiotic Fusion) for portrait to ensure consistency, and shallow (Direct Fusion) for audio to align animation with speech while preserving motion diversity. To maintain temporal consistency in long-duration video generation, we propose a memory bank mechanism that preserves inter-clip dependencies, effectively preventing degradation across extended sequences. Furthermore, we develop a noise-regularized training strategy that explicitly compensates for DDPM sampling artifacts, significantly improving the model's robustness in continuous generation scenarios.Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation quality, producing temporally coherent and realistic videos with enhanced diversity and liveliness, while maintaining remarkable efficiency through its optimized model design with 8$\times$ fewer parameters.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

Foundation models are large models, trained on broad data that deliver high accuracy in many downstream tasks, often without fine-tuning. For this reason, models such as CLIP , DINO or Vision Transfomers (ViT), are becoming the bedrock of many industrial AI-powered applications. However, the reliance on pre-trained foundation models also introduces significant security concerns, as these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks involve deliberately crafted inputs designed to deceive AI systems, jeopardizing their reliability. This paper studies the vulnerabilities of vision foundation models, focusing specifically on CLIP and ViTs, and explores the transferability of adversarial attacks to downstream tasks. We introduce a novel attack, targeting the structure of transformer-based architectures in a task-agnostic fashion.

However, their growing model size poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss, its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process, a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with 4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only 29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices.

Although domain adaptation offers a solution, privacy constraints often prevent access to source data, making Test-Time Adaptation (TTA, which adapts using only unlabeled test data) increasingly attractive. However, current TTA methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating, resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting. To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+. LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and backbones. Notably, LinearTCA achieves higher accuracy with only 4% GPU memory and 0.6% computation time compared to the best TTA baseline. It also outperforms existing methods on CLIP over 1.86%.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect the privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of SMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for Transformer models often leads to considerable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the multitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are not well-suited to SMPC and difficult to circumvent or optimize effectively. To address this concern, we introduce a comprehensive PPI framework called SecFormer to achieve fast and accurate PPI for Transformer models. We successfully eliminate the high-cost exponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model performance and develop a suite of efficient SMPC protocols by employing suitable numerical computation methods to boost other complex nonlinear functions in PPI, including GeLU, LayerNorm, and a redesigned Softmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer outperforms MPCFormer in performance, showing improvements of $3.4\%$ and $24.7\%$ for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, respectively. In terms of efficiency, SecFormer is 3.57 and 3.58 times faster than PUMA for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, demonstrating its effectiveness and speed.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |

Using 4D Gaussian as an inductive bias, 4DGT unifies static and dynamic components, enabling the modeling of complex, time-varying environments with varying object lifespans. We proposed a novel density control strategy in training, which enables our 4DGT to handle longer space-time input and remain efficient rendering at runtime. Our model processes 64 consecutive posed frames in a rolling-window fashion, predicting consistent 4D Gaussians in the scene. Unlike optimization-based methods, 4DGT performs purely feed-forward inference, reducing reconstruction time from hours to seconds and scaling effectively to long video sequences. Trained only on large-scale monocular posed video datasets, 4DGT can outperform prior Gaussian-based networks significantly in real-world videos and achieve on-par accuracy with optimization-based methods on cross-domain videos.

| **[Self Forcing: Bridging the Train-Test Gap in Autoregressive Video Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08009v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value (KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

| **[Generative Modeling of Weights: Generalization or Memorization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07998v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models, with their success in image and video generation, have recently been explored for synthesizing effective neural network weights. These approaches take trained neural network checkpoints as training data, and aim to generate high-performing neural network weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Surprisingly, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or at best simple interpolations, of the training checkpoints. Current methods fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. We further show that this memorization cannot be effectively mitigated by modifying modeling factors commonly associated with memorization in image diffusion models, or applying data augmentations. Our findings provide a realistic assessment of what types of data current generative models can model, and highlight the need for more careful evaluation of generative models in new domains.

| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Language Models over Canonical Byte-Pair Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07956v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models represent probability distributions over character strings as distributions over (shorter) token strings derived via a deterministic tokenizer, such as byte-pair encoding. While this approach is highly effective at scaling up language models to large corpora, its current incarnations have a concerning property: the model assigns nonzero probability mass to an exponential number of $\it{noncanonical}$ token encodings of each character string -- these are token strings that decode to valid character strings but are impossible under the deterministic tokenizer (i.e., they will never be seen in any training corpus, no matter how large). This misallocation is both erroneous, as noncanonical strings never appear in training data, and wasteful, diverting probability mass away from plausible outputs. These are avoidable mistakes! In this work, we propose methods to enforce canonicality in token-level language models, ensuring that only canonical token strings are assigned positive probability. We present two approaches: (1) canonicality by conditioning, leveraging test-time inference strategies without additional training, and (2) canonicality by construction, a model parameterization that guarantees canonical outputs but requires training. We demonstrate that fixing canonicality mistakes improves the likelihood of held-out data for several models and corpora.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Statistical Hypothesis Testing for Auditing Robustness in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07947v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the problem of testing whether the outputs of a large language model (LLM) system change under an arbitrary intervention, such as an input perturbation or changing the model variant. We cannot simply compare two LLM outputs since they might differ due to the stochastic nature of the system, nor can we compare the entire output distribution due to computational intractability. While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist, they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate alignment with reference models. Above all, we see this as a reliable frequentist hypothesis testing framework for LLM auditing.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2412.00868</p></details> |
| **[Predicting Situation Awareness from Physiological Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07930v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Situation awareness (SA)--comprising the ability to 1) perceive critical elements in the environment, 2) comprehend their meanings, and 3) project their future states--is critical for human operator performance. Due to the disruptive nature of gold-standard SA measures, researchers have sought physiological indicators to provide real-time information about SA. We extend prior work by using a multimodal suite of neurophysiological, psychophysiological, and behavioral signals, predicting all three levels of SA along a continuum, and predicting a comprehensive measure of SA in a complex multi-tasking simulation. We present a lab study in which 31 participants controlled an aircraft simulator task battery while wearing physiological sensors and responding to SA 'freeze-probe' assessments. We demonstrate the validity of task and assessment for measuring SA. Multimodal physiological models predict SA with greater predictive performance ($Q^2$ for levels 1-3 and total, respectively: 0.14, 0.00, 0.26, and 0.36) than models built with shuffled labels, demonstrating that multimodal physiological signals provide useful information in predicting all SA levels. Level 3 SA (projection) was best predicted, and level 2 SA comprehension) was the most challenging to predict. Ablation analysis and single sensor models found EEG and eye-tracking signals to be particularly useful to predictions of level 3 and total SA. A reduced sensor fusion model showed that predictive performance can be maintained with a subset of sensors. This first rigorous cross-validation assessment of predictive performance demonstrates the utility of multimodal physiological signals for inferring complex, holistic, objective measures of SA at all levels, non-disruptively, and along a continuum.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness depends heavily on the choice and initialization of the state matrix. In this work, we build on the SaFARi framework and existing WaLRUS SSMs to introduce a new variant, W4S4 (WaLRUS for S4), a new class of SSMs constructed from redundant wavelet frames. WaLRUS admits a stable diagonalization and supports fast kernel computation without requiring low-rank approximations, making it both theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. We show that WaLRUS retains information over long horizons significantly better than HiPPO-based SSMs, both in isolation and when integrated into deep architectures such as S4. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across delay reconstruction tasks, classification benchmarks, and long-range sequence modeling, confirming that high-quality, structured initialization enabled by wavelet-based state dynamic offers substantial advantages over existing alternatives. WaLRUS provides a scalable and versatile foundation for the next generation of deep SSM-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, performing per-Gaussian neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper, we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses. Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\times$, reduce model size by $7.71\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset. SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\times$ and $58.23\times$ on the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://speede3dgs.github.io/</p></details> |

Motivated by this, we introduce VLog, a novel video understanding framework that define video narrations as vocabulary, going beyond the typical subword vocabularies in existing generative video-language models. Built on the lightweight language model GPT-2, VLog feature three key innovations: (i) A generative retrieval model, marrying language model's complex reasoning capabilities with contrastive retrieval's flexible upgrading over narration vocabulary. (ii) A hierarchical vocabulary derived from large-scale video narrations using our narration pair encoding algorithm, enabling efficient indexing of specific events (e.g., cutting a tomato) by identifying broader scenarios (e.g., kitchen) with expressive postfixes (e.g., by the left hand). (iii) A vocabulary update strategy leveraging generative models to extend the vocabulary for novel events encountered during inference. To validate our approach, we introduce VidCap-Eval, a development set requiring concise narrations with reasoning relationships (e.g., before and after). Experiments on EgoSchema, COIN, and HiREST further demonstrate the effectiveness of VLog, highlighting its ability to generate concise, contextually accurate, and efficient narrations, offering a novel perspective on video understanding.

We achieve this efficiency through systematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training data, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of model architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention mechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context processing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and accurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2, a comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable satisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training tokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient pre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by introducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and data-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose CPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative sampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse on-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B parameters, respectively. Sufficient evaluation results show that MiniCPM4 outperforms open-source models of similar size across multiple benchmarks, highlighting both its efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, MiniCPM4-8B demonstrates significant speed improvements over Qwen3-8B when processing long sequences. Through further adaptation, MiniCPM4 successfully powers diverse applications, including trustworthy survey generation and tool use with model context protocol, clearly showcasing its broad usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>MiniC...</summary><p>MiniCPM4 Technical Report</p></details> |

However, editing such models efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous information - remains a major challenge. Existing methods for lifelong model editing either compromise generalization, interfere with past edits, or fail to scale to long editing sequences. We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts. Experiments on question answering, hallucination correction, and out-of-distribution generalization benchmarks across LLaMA-3 and Mistral demonstrate that MEMOIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across reliability, generalization, and locality metrics, scaling to thousands of sequential edits with minimal forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

To address the optimal filtering problem in general dynamic settings, we propose the $\alpha\beta$-HMM algorithm, which simplifies the state transition model to a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities and introduces a step-size parameter to balance the influence of observational data and the model. By analyzing the algorithm's dynamics in stationary environments, we uncover a fundamental trade-off between inference accuracy and adaptation capability, highlighting how key parameters and observation quality impact performance. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamical system governing the evolution of the log-belief ratio, along with supporting numerical experiments, demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively balances adaptability and inference performance in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension, submitted for publication.

Unlike standard cameras, which suffer from high latency and motion blur at fast ball speeds, event cameras provide higher temporal resolution, allowing more frequent state updates, greater robustness to outliers, and accurate trajectory predictions using just a short time window after the opponent's impact. We collect a dataset of ping-pong game sequences, including 3D ground-truth trajectories of the ball, synchronized with sensor data from the Meta Project Aria glasses and event streams. Our system leverages foveated vision, using eye-gaze data from the glasses to process only events in the viewer's fovea. This biologically inspired approach improves ball detection performance and significantly reduces computational latency, as it efficiently allocates resources to the most perceptually relevant regions, achieving a reduction factor of 10.81 on the collected trajectories. Our detection pipeline has a worst-case total latency of 4.5 ms, including computation and perception - significantly lower than a frame-based 30 FPS system, which, in the worst case, takes 66 ms solely for perception. Finally, we fit a trajectory prediction model to the estimated states of the ball, enabling 3D trajectory forecasting in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to predict table tennis trajectories from an egocentric perspective using event cameras.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW), Nashville (TN), USA, 2025; 5th International Workshop on Event-Based Vision</p></details> |
| **[Stability of Mean-Field Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07856v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is a widely used method for approximating high-dimensional probability distributions by product measures. This paper studies the stability properties of the mean-field approximation when the target distribution varies within the class of strongly log-concave measures. We establish dimension-free Lipschitz continuity of the MFVI optimizer with respect to the target distribution, measured in the 2-Wasserstein distance, with Lipschitz constant inversely proportional to the log-concavity parameter. Under additional regularity conditions, we further show that the MFVI optimizer depends differentiably on the target potential and characterize the derivative by a partial differential equation. Methodologically, we follow a novel approach to MFVI via linearized optimal transport: the non-convex MFVI problem is lifted to a convex optimization over transport maps with a fixed base measure, enabling the use of calculus of variations and functional analysis. We discuss several applications of our results to robust Bayesian inference and empirical Bayes, including a quantitative Bernstein--von Mises theorem for MFVI, as well as to distributed stochastic control.</p></details> | 43 pages |

A popular idea to address this problem consists of incorporating $\theta$ in the state of the system and allowing its time evolution, modelled as a Markov chain $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 1}$. This proxy model defines a so-called self-organizing SSM (SO-SSM) to which one may apply standard particle filters. However, the practical implementation of this idea in a theoretically justified manner has remained an open problem until now. In this paper we fill this gap and in particular show that theoretically consistent SO-SSMs can be defined such that $\|\mathrm{Var}(\theta_{t+1}|\theta_{t})\|\rightarrow 0$ slowly as $t\rightarrow\infty$. This, in turn, leads to particle filter algorithms for online inference in SSMs which we find to be robust in simulation. We also develop constructions of $(\theta_t)_{t\geq 1}$ and associated theoretical guarantees tailored to the application of SO-SSMs to maximum likelihood estimation in SSMs, leading to novel iterated filtering algorithms. The algorithms developed in this work have the advantage of being simple to implement and to require minimal tuning to perform well.</p></details> | <details><summary>93 pa...</summary><p>93 pages (25 pages for the paper and 68 pages for the supplementary material), 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15487v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscientists to study how large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed to image deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is computational imaging: the co-development of optics designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, with algorithms that compensate by inverting the optical coding to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopy video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the loss of information by 1) extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to effectively integrate the fluorescence of several lines into a single set of measurements and 2) imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame, NORA recovers full video sequences via nuclear-norm minimization on the pixels-by-time matrix, for which we prove theoretical guarantees on recovery. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulator, and used the simulations to demonstrate that NORA can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions. As NORA requires minimal changes to current microscopy systems, our results indicate that NORA can provide a promising avenue towards fast imaging of neural circuits.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

However, methods based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning often suffer from high sample complexity, poor generalization, and low safety. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an efficient and generalized end-to-end autonomous driving system (EGADS) for complex and varied scenarios. The RL agent in our EGADS combines variational inference with normalizing flows, which are independent of distribution assumptions. This combination allows the agent to capture historical information relevant to driving in latent space effectively, thereby significantly reducing sample complexity. Additionally, we enhance safety by formulating robust safety constraints and improve generalization and performance by integrating RL with expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EGADS significantly reduces sample complexity, greatly improves safety performance, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities in complex urban scenarios. Particularly, we contributed an expert dataset collected through human expert steering wheel control, specifically using the G29 steering wheel.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML PKDD 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> |

This work identifies two problems that are largely ignored by existing image demoir\'eing approaches: 1) moir\'e patterns vary across different channels (RGB); 2) repetitive patterns are constantly observed. However, employing conventional convolutional (CNN) layers cannot address these problems. Instead, this paper presents the use of our recently proposed \emph{Shape} concept. It was originally employed to model consistent features from fragmented regions, particularly when identical or similar objects coexist in an RGB-D image. Interestingly, we find that the Shape information effectively captures the moir\'e patterns in artifact images. Motivated by this discovery, we propose a new method, ShapeMoir\'e, for image demoir\'eing. Beyond modeling shape features at the patch-level, we further extend this to the global image-level and design a novel Shape-Architecture. Consequently, our proposed method, equipped with both ShapeConv and Shape-Architecture, can be seamlessly integrated into existing approaches without introducing any additional parameters or computation overhead during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used datasets, and the results demonstrate that our ShapeMoir\'e achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in terms of the PSNR metric.</p></details> | 19 pages |

A prevalent solution is a dual-system architecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a larger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system designs often implement parallel architectures where inference is either directly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved from previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle to enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key insight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous time steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large models respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we introduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system designed to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current frame using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame features using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate these dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes action-critical image regions. Evaluated on the Bench2Drive CARLA Leaderboard-v2 benchmark, ETA advances state-of-the-art performance by 8% with a driving score of 69.53 while maintaining a near-real-time inference speed at 50 ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 submission.

SNNs utilize binary spike activations for efficient information transmission, replacing multiplications with additions, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. However, binary spike activation maps often fail to capture sufficient data information, resulting in reduced accuracy. To address this challenge, we advocate reversing the bit of the weight and activation for SNNs, called \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, inspired by recent findings that highlight greater accuracy degradation from quantizing activations compared to weights. Specifically, our method employs real-valued spike activations alongside binary weights in SNNs. This preserves the event-driven and multiplication-free advantages of standard SNNs while enhancing the information capacity of activations. Additionally, we introduce a trainable factor within binary weights to adaptively learn suitable weight amplitudes during training, thereby increasing network capacity. To maintain efficiency akin to vanilla \textbf{ReverB-SNN}, our trainable binary weight SNNs are converted back to standard form using a re-parameterization technique during inference. Extensive experiments across various network architectures and datasets, both static and dynamic, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accpeted by ICML2024 |

These risks can be amplified by the recent adversarial attacks, fine-tuning vulnerabilities, and the increasing deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments. Existing safety-enhancing techniques, such as fine-tuning with human feedback or adversarial training, are still vulnerable as they address specific threats and often fail to generalize across unseen attacks, or require manual system-level defenses. This paper introduces RepBend, a novel approach that fundamentally disrupts the representations underlying harmful behaviors in LLMs, offering a scalable solution to enhance (potentially inherent) safety. RepBend brings the idea of activation steering - simple vector arithmetic for steering model's behavior during inference - to loss-based fine-tuning. Through extensive evaluation, RepBend achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods such as Circuit Breaker, RMU, and NPO, with up to 95% reduction in attack success rates across diverse jailbreak benchmarks, all with negligible reduction in model usability and general capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Current tools have not been widely validated, particularly in settings of developing brains or underlying pathology. We present TissUnet, a deep learning model that segments skull bone, subcutaneous fat, and muscle from routine three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI, with or without contrast enhancement. The model was trained on 155 paired MRI-computed tomography (CT) scans and validated across nine datasets covering a wide age range and including individuals with brain tumors. In comparison to AI-CT-derived labels from 37 MRI-CT pairs, TissUnet achieved a median Dice coefficient of 0.79 [IQR: 0.77-0.81] in a healthy adult cohort. In a second validation using expert manual annotations, median Dice was 0.83 [IQR: 0.83-0.84] in healthy individuals and 0.81 [IQR: 0.78-0.83] in tumor cases, outperforming previous state-of-the-art method. Acceptability testing resulted in an 89% acceptance rate after adjudication by a tie-breaker(N=108 MRIs), and TissUnet demonstrated excellent performance in the blinded comparative review (N=45 MRIs), including both healthy and tumor cases in pediatric populations. TissUnet enables fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation of extracranial tissues, supporting large-scale studies on craniofacial morphology, treatment effects, and cardiometabolic risk using standard brain T1w MRI.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures, supplementary material</p></details> |

Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents. Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models.

While extensively studied for neural networks, the security and privacy implications of tree-based models remain underexplored. This work introduces TimberStrike, an optimization-based dataset reconstruction attack targeting horizontally federated tree-based models. Our attack, carried out by a single client, exploits the discrete nature of decision trees by using split values and decision paths to infer sensitive training data from other clients. We evaluate TimberStrike on State-of-the-Art federated gradient boosting implementations across multiple frameworks, including Flower, NVFlare, and FedTree, demonstrating their vulnerability to privacy breaches. On a publicly available stroke prediction dataset, TimberStrike consistently reconstructs between 73.05% and 95.63% of the target dataset across all implementations. We further analyze Differential Privacy, showing that while it partially mitigates the attack, it also significantly degrades model performance. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for tree-based Federated Learning systems, and we provide preliminary insights into their design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (To appear) 2025(4)</p></details> |
| **[Remote Sensing Image Classification with Decoupled Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19111v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the challenges posed by the large number of parameters in existing remote sensing image classification models, which hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices, this paper proposes a lightweight classification method based on knowledge distillation. Specifically, G-GhostNet is adopted as the backbone network, leveraging feature reuse to reduce redundant parameters and significantly improve inference efficiency. In addition, a decoupled knowledge distillation strategy is employed, which separates target and non-target classes to effectively enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on the RSOD and AID datasets demonstrate that, compared with the high-parameter VGG-16 model, the proposed method achieves nearly equivalent Top-1 accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by 6.24 times. This approach strikes an excellent balance between model size and classification performance, offering an efficient solution for deployment on resource-limited devices.</p></details> | 7 |
| **[Scalable Spatiotemporal Modeling for Bicycle Count Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07582v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel sparse spatiotemporal dynamic generalized linear model for efficient inference and prediction of bicycle count data. Assuming Poisson distributed counts with spacetime-varying rates, we model the log-rate using spatiotemporal intercepts, dynamic temporal covariates, and site-specific effects additively. Spatiotemporal dependence is modeled using a spacetime-varying intercept that evolves smoothly over time with spatially correlated errors, and coefficients of some temporal covariates including seasonal harmonics also evolve dynamically over time. Inference is performed following the Bayesian paradigm, and uncertainty quantification is naturally accounted for when predicting bicycle counts for unobserved locations and future times of interest. To address the challenges of high-dimensional inference of spatiotemporal data in a Bayesian setting, we develop a customized hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. To address the computational burden of dense covariance matrices, we extend our framework to high-dimensional spatial settings using the sparse SPDE approach of Lindgren et al. (2011), demonstrating its accuracy and scalability on both synthetic data and Montreal Island bicycle datasets. The proposed approach naturally provides missing value imputations, kriging, future forecasting, spatiotemporal predictions, and inference of model components. Moreover, it provides ways to predict average annual daily bicycles (AADB), a key metric often sought when designing bicycle networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages; 5 figures; 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[HSF: Defending against Jailbreak Attacks with Hidden State Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03788v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing deployment of LLMs in daily applications like chatbots and content generation, efforts to ensure outputs align with human values and avoid harmful content have intensified. However, increasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks threaten this alignment, aiming to induce unsafe outputs. Current defense efforts either focus on prompt rewriting or detection, which are limited in effectiveness due to the various design of jailbreak prompts, or on output control and detection, which are computationally expensive as they require LLM inference. Therefore, designing a pre-inference defense method that resists diverse jailbreak prompts is crucial for preventing LLM jailbreak attacks. We observe that jailbreak attacks, safe queries, and harmful queries exhibit different clustering patterns within the LLM's hidden state representation space. This suggests that by leveraging the LLM's hidden state representational capabilities, we can analyze the LLM's forthcoming behavior and proactively intervene for defense. In this paper, we propose a jailbreak attack defense strategy based on a Hidden State Filter (HSF), a lossless architectural defense mechanism that enables the model to preemptively identify and reject adversarial inputs before the inference process begins. We activate its defensive potential through an additional plugin module, effectively framing the defense task as a classification problem. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, utilizing three different LLMs, show that HSF significantly enhances resilience against six cutting-edge jailbreak attacks. It significantly reduces the success rate of jailbreak attacks while minimally impacting responses to benign user queries, with negligible inference overhead, and outperforming defense baselines.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Hidden-State-Filtering-8652/</p></details> | <details><summary>WWW20...</summary><p>WWW2025 WSAI BESTPAPER</p></details> |
| **[SELT: Self-Evaluation Tree Search for LLMs with Task Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07557v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of applications, their performance often degrades in complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we introduce SELT (Self-Evaluation LLM Tree Search), a novel framework that leverages a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance LLM reasoning without relying on external reward models. By redefining the Upper Confidence Bound scoring to align with intrinsic self-evaluation capabilities of LLMs and decomposing the inference process into atomic subtasks augmented with semantic clustering at each node, SELT effectively balances exploration and exploitation, reduces redundant reasoning paths, and mitigates hallucination. We validate our approach on challenging benchmarks, including the knowledge-based MMLU and the Tool Learning dataset Seal-Tools, where SELT achieves significant improvements in answer accuracy and reasoning robustness compared to baseline methods. Notably, our framework operates without task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating strong generalizability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Existing approaches, such as quantization, have demonstrated promising results in reducing memory usage. However, current quantization methods cannot take both effectiveness and efficiency into account. In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally, we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to further reduce the inference overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025)</p></details> |

However, their growing model size poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained robotic systems. While 1-bit pretraining has proven effective for enhancing the inference efficiency of large language models with minimal performance loss, its application to VLA models remains underexplored. In this work, we present BitVLA, the first 1-bit VLA model for robotics manipulation, in which every parameter is ternary, i.e., {-1, 0, 1}. To further reduce the memory footprint of the vision encoder, we propose the distillation-aware training strategy that compresses the full-precision encoder to 1.58-bit weights. During this process, a full-precision encoder serves as a teacher model to better align latent representations. Despite the lack of large-scale robotics pretraining, BitVLA achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art model OpenVLA-OFT with 4-bit post-training quantization on the LIBERO benchmark, while consuming only 29.8% of the memory. These results highlight BitVLA's promise for deployment on memory-constrained edge devices. We release the code and model weights in https://github.com/ustcwhy/BitVLA.</p></details> | Work in progress |

The standard call waiting alert does not provide the urgency or content of the waiting call. This paper proposes a novel method for transmitting Generative Voice Bursts short, context aware audio messages during ongoing calls, from either preauthorized or dynamically prioritized callers. By leveraging generative AI techniques, the system automatically generates spoken messages from contextual inputs example like location, health data, images, background noise when the caller is unable to speak due to incapacitation or environmental constraints. The solution incorporates voice, text, and priority inference mechanisms, allowing high priority emergency messages to bypass conventional call waiting barriers. The approach employs models such as GPT Neo for generative text, which is synthesized into audio and delivered in configurable intervals G seconds and counts N times, ensuring minimal disruption while preserving urgency. This method holds potential for significant impact across telecom, mobile device manufacturing, and emergency communication platforms.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

In this work, we present pseudo-random sequences for low-cost operando battery impedance measurements.

We describe the application of pseudo-random sequences and provide the data processing required to suppress drift and transients, validated on simulations. Finally, we perform experimental operando impedance measurements on a Li-ion battery cell during fast-charging, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed method. It's low-cost hardware requirements, fast measurements, and simple data-processing make the method practical for embedding in battery management systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect the privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of SMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for Transformer models often leads to considerable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the multitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are not well-suited to SMPC and difficult to circumvent or optimize effectively. To address this concern, we introduce a comprehensive PPI framework called SecFormer to achieve fast and accurate PPI for Transformer models. We successfully eliminate the high-cost exponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model performance and develop a suite of efficient SMPC protocols by employing suitable numerical computation methods to boost other complex nonlinear functions in PPI, including GeLU, LayerNorm, and a redesigned Softmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer outperforms MPCFormer in performance, showing improvements of $3.4\%$ and $24.7\%$ for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, respectively. In terms of efficiency, SecFormer is 3.57 and 3.58 times faster than PUMA for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, demonstrating its effectiveness and speed.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Scalable Sobolev IPM for Probability Measures on a Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00737v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the Sobolev IPM problem for probability measures supported on a graph metric space. Sobolev IPM is an important instance of integral probability metrics (IPM), and is obtained by constraining a critic function within a unit ball defined by the Sobolev norm. In particular, it has been used to compare probability measures and is crucial for several theoretical works in machine learning. However, to our knowledge, there are no efficient algorithmic approaches to compute Sobolev IPM effectively, which hinders its practical applications. In this work, we establish a relation between Sobolev norm and weighted $L^p$-norm, and leverage it to propose a \emph{novel regularization} for Sobolev IPM. By exploiting the graph structure, we demonstrate that the regularized Sobolev IPM provides a \emph{closed-form} expression for fast computation. This advancement addresses long-standing computational challenges, and paves the way to apply Sobolev IPM for practical applications, even in large-scale settings. Additionally, the regularized Sobolev IPM is negative definite. Utilizing this property, we design positive-definite kernels upon the regularized Sobolev IPM, and provide preliminary evidences of their advantages for comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and topological data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we propose an all-optical reservoir, consisting of integrated double-ring resonators (DRRs) as nodes, for fast and accurate optical packet header recognition. As the delay-bandwidth product (DBP) of the node is a key figure-of-merit in the reservoir, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to maximize the DBPs for various types of DRRs, which has the advantage of full parameter space optimization and fast convergence speed. Intriguingly, the optimized DBPs of the DRRs in cascaded, parallel, and embedded configurations reach the same maximum value, which is believed to be the global maximum. Finally, 3-bit and 6-bit packet header recognition tasks are performed with the all-optical reservoir consisting of the optimized cascaded rings, which have greatly reduced chip size and the desired "flat-top" delay spectra. Using this optical computing scheme, word-error rates as low as 5*10-4 and 9*10-4 are achieved for 3-bit and 6-bit packet header recognition tasks, respectively, which are one order of magnitude better than the previously reported values.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics (JSTQE),2023</p></details> |

Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

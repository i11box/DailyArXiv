| **[Lost in Translation? Vocabulary Alignment for Source-Free Domain Adaptation in Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15225v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>BMVC ...</summary><p>BMVC 2025 - Project Page: https://thegoodailab.org/blog/vocalign - Code: https://github.com/Sisso16/VocAlign</p></details> |
| **[Calibration-Aware Prompt Learning for Medical Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15226v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences. Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy.

| **[Depth AnyEvent: A Cross-Modal Distillation Paradigm for Event-Based Monocular Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15224v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information, making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally, we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2), or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Two Web Toolkits for Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset Acquisition and Fingering Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15222v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piano performance is a multimodal activity that intrinsically combines physical actions with the acoustic rendition. Despite growing research interest in analyzing the multimodal nature of piano performance, the laborious process of acquiring large-scale multimodal data remains a significant bottleneck, hindering further progress in this field. To overcome this barrier, we present an integrated web toolkit comprising two graphical user interfaces (GUIs): (i) PiaRec, which supports the synchronized acquisition of audio, video, MIDI, and performance metadata. (ii) ASDF, which enables the efficient annotation of performer fingering from the visual data. Collectively, this system can streamline the acquisition of multimodal piano performance datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Late-Breaking Demo Session of the 26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight and Accurate Multi-View Stereo with Confidence-Aware Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15220v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory. CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D.

We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Project: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnVLA-001</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Surface Alignment: Rebuilding LLMs Safety Mechanism via Probabilistically Ablating Refusal Direction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15202v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jailbreak attacks pose persistent threats to large language models (LLMs). Current safety alignment methods have attempted to address these issues, but they experience two significant limitations: insufficient safety alignment depth and unrobust internal defense mechanisms. These limitations make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks such as prefilling and refusal direction manipulation. We introduce DeepRefusal, a robust safety alignment framework that overcomes these issues. DeepRefusal forces the model to dynamically rebuild its refusal mechanisms from jailbreak states. This is achieved by probabilistically ablating the refusal direction across layers and token depths during fine-tuning. Our method not only defends against prefilling and refusal direction attacks but also demonstrates strong resilience against other unseen jailbreak strategies. Extensive evaluations on four open-source LLM families and six representative attacks show that DeepRefusal reduces attack success rates by approximately 95%, while maintaining model capabilities with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Finding</p></details> |
| **[TITAN: A Trajectory-Informed Technique for Adaptive Parameter Freezing in Large-Scale VQE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15193v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading candidate for harnessing quantum computers to advance quantum chemistry and materials simulations, yet its training efficiency deteriorates rapidly for large Hamiltonians. Two issues underlie this bottleneck: (i) the no-cloning theorem imposes a linear growth in circuit evaluations with the number of parameters per gradient step; and (ii) deeper circuits encounter barren plateaus (BPs), leading to exponentially increasing measurement overheads. To address these challenges, here we propose a deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive parameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of Hamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy. The motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of parameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its design combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring each training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural architecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark transverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems up to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60% fewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or surpassing their estimation accuracy. By proactively trimming parameter space, Titan lowers hardware demands and offers a scalable path toward utilizing VQE to advance practical quantum chemistry and materials science.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Channel Prediction under Network Distribution Shift Using Continual Learning-based Loss Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15192v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern wireless networks face critical challenges when mobile users traverse heterogeneous network configurations with varying antenna layouts, carrier frequencies, and scattering statistics. Traditional predictors degrade under distribution shift, with NMSE rising by 37.5\% during cross-configuration handovers. This work addresses catastrophic forgetting in channel prediction by proposing a continual learning framework based on loss regularization. The approach augments standard training objectives with penalty terms that selectively preserve network parameters essential for previous configurations while enabling adaptation to new environments. Two prominent regularization strategies are investigated: Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Across 3GPP scenarios and multiple architectures, SI lowers the high-SNR NMSE floor by up to 1.8 dB ($\approx$32--34\%), while EWC achieves up to 1.4 dB ($\approx$17--28\%). Notably, standard EWC incurs $\mathcal{O}(MK)$ complexity (storing $M$ Fisher diagonal entries and corresponding parameter snapshots across $K$ tasks) unless consolidated, whereas SI maintains $\mathcal{O}(M)$ memory complexity (storing $M$ model parameters), independent of task sequence length, making it suitable for resource-constrained wireless infrastructure</p></details> | ICASSP 2026 |
| **[Fast and Fluent Diffusion Language Models via Convolutional Decoding and Rejective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15188v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) language models generate text one token at a time, which limits their inference speed. Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 spotlight</p></details> |
| **[MaRVIn: A Cross-Layer Mixed-Precision RISC-V Framework for DNN Inference, from ISA Extension to Hardware Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15187v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of quantization and mixed-precision techniques has unlocked new possibilities for enhancing the speed and energy efficiency of NNs. Several recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design, resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we integrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal mixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up to 1.8 TOPs/W.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, March 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understand Before You Generate: Self-Guided Training for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15185v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[A mathematical model for Nordic skiing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02767v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nordic skiing provides fascinating opportunities for mathematical modelling studies that exploit methods and insights from physics, applied mathematics, data analysis, scientific computing and sports science. A typical ski course winds over varied terrain with frequent changes in elevation and direction, and so its geometry is naturally described by a three-dimensional space curve. The skier travels along a course under the influence of various forces, and their dynamics can be described using a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are derived from Newton's laws of motion. We develop an algorithm for solving the governing equations that combines Hermite spline interpolation, numerical quadrature and a high-order ODE solver. Numerical simulations are compared with measurements of skiers on actual courses to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. Throughout, we aim to illustrate how elementary concepts from undergraduate courses in calculus and scientific computing can be applied to study real problems in sport, which we hope will provide stimulating examples for both instructors and students. At the same time, we demonstrate how these concepts are capable of providing novel insights into skiing that should also be of interest to sport scientists.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables, 19 exercises, 7 supplementary materials</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Prior-based Non-stationary Channel Estimation Using Accelerated Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15182v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless channels in motion-rich urban microcell (UMi) settings are non-stationary; mobility and scatterer dynamics shift the distribution over time, degrading classical and deep estimators. This work proposes conditional prior diffusion for channel estimation, which learns a history-conditioned score to denoise noisy channel snapshots. A temporal encoder with cross-time attention compresses a short observation window into a context vector, which captures the channel's instantaneous coherence and steers the denoiser via feature-wise modulation. In inference, an SNR-matched initialization selects the diffusion step whose marginal aligns with the measured input SNR, and the process follows a shortened, geometrically spaced schedule, preserving the signal-to-noise trajectory with far fewer iterations. Temporal self-conditioning with the previous channel estimate and a training-only smoothness penalty further stabilizes evolution without biasing the test-time estimator. Evaluations on a 3GPP benchmark show lower NMSE across all SNRs than LMMSE, GMM, LSTM, and LDAMP baselines, demonstrating stable performance and strong high SNR fidelity.</p></details> | ICASSP 2026 |

We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles, and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11 maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables.

| **[Parallel Simulation of Contact and Actuation for Soft Growing Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15180v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

We introduce QA-LIGN, which decomposes monolithic rewards into interpretable principle-specific evaluations through structured natural language programs. Models learn through a draft, critique, and revise pipeline, where symbolic evaluation against the rubrics provides transparent feedback for both initial and revised responses during GRPO training. Applied to uncensored Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, QA-LIGN reduces attack success rates by up to 68.7% while maintaining a 0.67% false refusal rate, achieving Pareto optimal safety-helpfulness performance and outperforming both DPO and GRPO with state-of-the-art reward models given equivalent training. These results demonstrate that making reward signals interpretable and modular improves alignment effectiveness, suggesting transparency enhances LLM safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

Experiments on three benchmark tasks -- HateXplain, Latent Hate, and Implicit Hate -- demonstrate that SMARTER enables LLMs to achieve up to a 13.5% macro-F1 improvement over standard few-shot baselines while using only a fraction of the full training data.

| **[Semi-Supervised 3D Medical Segmentation from 2D Natural Images Pretrained Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15167v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its adaptability as more advanced models emerge.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries, which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs. This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG behavior covertly. We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility, to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings. Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to reassess the shared instructional prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Self-Improving Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15155v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage, Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key to this sample-efficiency.

We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

However, existing alignment approaches, including pluralistic paradigms like Modular Pluralism, often fall short in the health domain, where personal, cultural, and situational factors shape pluralism. Motivated by the aforementioned healthcare challenges, we propose a first lightweight, generalizable, pluralistic alignment approach, EthosAgents, designed to simulate diverse perspectives and values. We empirically show that it advances the pluralistic alignment for all three modes across seven varying-sized open and closed models. Our findings reveal that health-related pluralism demands adaptable and normatively aware approaches, offering insights into how these models can better respect diversity in other high-stakes domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main Proceedings)</p></details> |

Specifically, we focus on a random Transformer with a nonlinear MLP head where the first layer is randomly initialized and fixed while the second layer is trained. Furthermore, we consider an asymptotic regime where the context length, input dimension, hidden dimension, number of training tasks, and number of training samples jointly grow. In this setting, we show that the random Transformer behaves equivalent to a finite-degree Hermite polynomial model in terms of ICL error. This equivalence is validated through simulations across varying activation functions, context lengths, hidden layer widths (revealing a double-descent phenomenon), and regularization settings. Our results offer theoretical and empirical insights into when and how MLP layers enhance ICL, and how nonlinearity and over-parameterization influence model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>MLSP ...</summary><p>MLSP 2025, 6 pages 2 figures</p></details> |

We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the MATH, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 datasets, across various draft-target model families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference. We have released the code at https://github.com/menik1126/asynchronous-test-time-scaling.</p></details> | Tech Report |

Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization (TERM) extends ERM by introducing an exponential tilt hyperparameter $t$ to balance average-case accuracy with worst-case fairness and robustness. However, in online or streaming settings where data arrive one sample at a time, the classical TERM objective degenerates to standard ERM, losing tilt sensitivity. We address this limitation by proposing an online TERM formulation that removes the logarithm from the classical objective, preserving tilt effects without additional computational or memory overhead. This formulation enables a continuous trade-off controlled by $t$, smoothly interpolating between ERM ($t \to 0$), fairness emphasis ($t > 0$), and robustness to outliers ($t < 0$). We empirically validate online TERM on two representative streaming tasks: robust linear regression with adversarial outliers and minority-class detection in binary classification. Our results demonstrate that negative tilting effectively suppresses outlier influence, while positive tilting improves recall with minimal impact on precision, all at per-sample computational cost equivalent to ERM. Online TERM thus recovers the full robustness-fairness spectrum of classical TERM in an efficient single-sample learning regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>MLSP ...</summary><p>MLSP 2025, 6 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF.

But if the assumptions are inaccurate the actual sample size required to develop a reliable model may be very different. To safeguard against this, adaptive sample size approaches have been proposed, based on sequential evaluation of a models predictive performance. Aim: illustrate and extend sequential sample size calculations for CPM development by (i) proposing stopping rules based on minimising uncertainty (instability) and misclassification of individual-level predictions, and (ii) showcasing how it safeguards against inaccurate fixed sample size calculations. Using the sequential approach repeats the pre-defined model development strategy every time a chosen number (e.g., 100) of participants are recruited and adequately followed up. At each stage, CPM performance is evaluated using bootstrapping, leading to prediction and classification stability statistics and plots, alongside optimism-adjusted measures of calibration and discrimination. Our approach is illustrated for development of acute kidney injury using logistic regression CPMs. The fixed sample size calculation, based on perceived sensible assumptions suggests recruiting 342 patients to minimise overfitting; however, the sequential approach reveals that a much larger sample size of 1100 is required to minimise overfitting (targeting population-level stability). If the stopping rule criteria also target small uncertainty and misclassification probability of individual predictions, the sequential approach suggests an even larger sample size (n=1800). Our sequential sample size approach allows users to dynamically monitor individual-level prediction and classification instability and safeguard against using inaccurate assumptions.</p></details> | 36 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Probing the Representational Power of Sparse Autoencoders in Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11277v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Findings |

Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

However, this potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://worldforge-agi.github.io/</p></details> |

This model allows precise control of the input moment structure via a weighting parameter. Building on an existing ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based analysis in the high-dimensional limit, we demonstrate that as the high-order moments increase, the algorithm exhibits slower convergence and demands both a lower learning rate and greater initial alignment to achieve informative solutions. Our findings highlight the algorithm's sensitivity to the statistical structure of the input data, particularly its moment characteristics. Furthermore, the ODE framework reveals a critical learning rate threshold necessary for learning when moments approach their maximum. These insights motivate future directions in moment-aware initialization and adaptive learning rate strategies to counteract the degradation in learning speed caused by high non-Gaussianity, thereby enhancing the robustness and efficiency of ICA in complex, high-dimensional settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>MLSP ...</summary><p>MLSP 2025, 6 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we overview a promising learning paradigm, i.e., Modular Machine Learning (MML), as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs capable of addressing these issues. We begin by systematically and comprehensively surveying the existing literature on modular machine learning, with a particular focus on modular data representation and modular models. Then, we propose a unified MML framework for LLMs, which decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning. Specifically, the MML paradigm discussed in this article is able to: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable an interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We further elaborate a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. Last but not least, we critically identify the remaining key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, we believe the integration of the MML with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Integrating partial differential equation (PDE) based physics knowledge with machine learning provides enhanced interpretability and utility over classic numerical methods. However, current physics-integrated machine learning methods are limited to considering a single PDE, severely limiting their application to diseases where multiple mechanisms are responsible for different groups (i.e., subtypes) and aggravating problems with model misspecification and degeneracy. Here, we present a deep generative model for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-based PDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure. Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder (VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes of interpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) from neuroimaging data. We evaluate our method on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its potential for uncovering mechanistic subtypes of Alzheimer's disease progression from positron emission tomography (PET) data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, accepted at SASHIMI workshop, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as the only supervision.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Traditionally, estimating item difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items, followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get difficulty estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with a large language model (LLM)-based scoring model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty estimates. Through extensive experiments on two real-world student response datasets, we show that SMART outperforms other item difficulty prediction methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in EMNLP 2025: The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing</p></details> |

The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Project: https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnVLA-001</p></details> |

This work introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images.

Several recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design, resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we integrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal mixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up to 1.8 TOPs/W.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, March 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Prior-based Non-stationary Channel Estimation Using Accelerated Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15182v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless channels in motion-rich urban microcell (UMi) settings are non-stationary; mobility and scatterer dynamics shift the distribution over time, degrading classical and deep estimators. This work proposes conditional prior diffusion for channel estimation, which learns a history-conditioned score to denoise noisy channel snapshots. A temporal encoder with cross-time attention compresses a short observation window into a context vector, which captures the channel's instantaneous coherence and steers the denoiser via feature-wise modulation. In inference, an SNR-matched initialization selects the diffusion step whose marginal aligns with the measured input SNR, and the process follows a shortened, geometrically spaced schedule, preserving the signal-to-noise trajectory with far fewer iterations. Temporal self-conditioning with the previous channel estimate and a training-only smoothness penalty further stabilizes evolution without biasing the test-time estimator. Evaluations on a 3GPP benchmark show lower NMSE across all SNRs than LMMSE, GMM, LSTM, and LDAMP baselines, demonstrating stable performance and strong high SNR fidelity.</p></details> | ICASSP 2026 |

Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage, Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill acquisition in robotics.

Furthermore, we consider an asymptotic regime where the context length, input dimension, hidden dimension, number of training tasks, and number of training samples jointly grow. In this setting, we show that the random Transformer behaves equivalent to a finite-degree Hermite polynomial model in terms of ICL error. This equivalence is validated through simulations across varying activation functions, context lengths, hidden layer widths (revealing a double-descent phenomenon), and regularization settings. Our results offer theoretical and empirical insights into when and how MLP layers enhance ICL, and how nonlinearity and over-parameterization influence model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>MLSP ...</summary><p>MLSP 2025, 6 pages 2 figures</p></details> |

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NIPS 2025</p></details> |

This paper addresses the fundamental problem of checking whether claimed crystals are novel, not noisy perturbations of known materials obtained by unrealistic atomic replacements. Such near-duplicates have already skewed ground truth because past comparisons relied on discontinuous cells and symmetries. The proposed Lipschitz continuity under noise is a new essential requirement for machine learning on any data objects that have ambiguous representations and live in continuous spaces. For periodic point sets under isometry (any distance-preserving transformation), we designed invariants that distinguish all known counter-examples to the completeness of past descriptors and confirm thousands of (near-)duplicates in the world's largest databases of inorganic crystals within hours on a desktop computer.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 9 figures, 14 tables.

While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages total, 1 figure</p></details> |

RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models.

However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NeurIPS 2025 spotlight</p></details> |

However, their application to graph structured data, where capturing topological connections is essential, remains underexplored and underperforming compared to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly in the graph clustering task. GNN tends to overemphasize neighborhood aggregation, leading to a homogenization of node representations. Conversely, Transformer tends to over globalize, highlighting distant nodes at the expense of meaningful local patterns. This dichotomy raises a key question: Is attention inherently redundant for unsupervised graph learning? To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis, uncovering the complementary weaknesses of GNN and Transformer in graph clustering. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Attentive Graph Clustering Network (AGCN) a novel architecture that reinterprets the notion that graph is attention. AGCN directly embeds the attention mechanism into the graph structure, enabling effective global information extraction while maintaining sensitivity to local topological cues. Our framework incorporates theoretical analysis to contrast AGCN behavior with GNN and Transformer and introduces two innovations: (1) a KV cache mechanism to improve computational efficiency, and (2) a pairwise margin contrastive loss to boost the discriminative capacity of the attention space. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that AGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce warp quantification analysis (WQA), a framework that derives interpretable geometric and structural descriptors from DTW paths. Controlled simulations showed that each metric selectively tracked its intended driver with minimal crosstalk. Applied to large-scale fMRI, WQA revealed distinct network signatures and complementary associations with schizophrenia negative symptom severity, capturing clinically meaningful variability beyond DTW distance. WQA transforms DTW from a single-score method into a family of alignment descriptors, offering a principled and generalizable extension for richer characterization of temporal coupling across domains where nonlinear normalization is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

As the need for intelligence grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However, deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge. Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference. FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution, we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures and tables, less than 5500 words.

However, predictive modeling of previously highlighted CPE-associated risks such as readmission, mortality, and extended length of stay (LOS) remains underexplored, particularly with modern deep learning approaches. This study introduces an eXplainable AI modeling framework to investigate CPE impact on patient outcomes from Electronic Medical Records data of an Irish hospital. We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an Irish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient demographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several Transformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine learning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were applied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated the utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently outperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially for CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related features, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and network centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient outcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that features like "Area of Residence", "Admission Ward" and prior admissions are key risk factors. Network variables like "Ward PageRank" also ranked highly, reflecting the potential value of structural exposure information. This study presents a robust and explainable AI framework for analyzing complex EMR data to identify key risk factors and predict CPE-related outcomes. Our findings underscore the superior performance of the Transformer models and highlight the importance of diverse clinical and network features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making on September 18th 2025</p></details> |

This realisation has led to many parties employing artificial users (or bots) to mislead others into believing untruths or acting in a beneficial manner to such parties. Sophisticated text generation tools, such as large language models, have further exacerbated this issue. This paper aims to compare the effectiveness of bot detection models based on encoder and decoder transformers. Pipelines are developed to evaluate the performance of these classifiers, revealing that encoder-based classifiers demonstrate greater accuracy and robustness. However, decoder-based models showed greater adaptability through task-specific alignment, suggesting more potential for generalisation across different use cases in addition to superior observa. These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to prevent digital environments being manipulated while protecting the integrity of online discussion.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in proceedings of UKCI 2025</p></details> |

Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Yet, many court decisions lack them due to the high cost of manual annotation. To address this gap, we introduce the Swiss Landmark Decisions Summarization (SLDS) dataset containing 20K rulings from the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, each with headnotes in German, French, and Italian. SLDS has the potential to significantly improve access to legal information and transform legal research in Switzerland. We fine-tune open models (Qwen2.5, Llama 3.2, Phi-3.5) and compare them to larger general-purpose and reasoning-tuned LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and the open-source DeepSeek R1. Using an LLM-as-a-Judge framework, we find that fine-tuned models perform well in terms of lexical similarity, while larger models generate more legally accurate and coherent summaries. Interestingly, reasoning-focused models show no consistent benefit, suggesting that factual precision is more important than deep reasoning in this task. We release SLDS under a CC BY 4.0 license to support future research in cross-lingual legal summarization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

We introduce Action Reasoning Models (ARMs), a class of robotic foundation models that integrate perception, planning, and control through a structured three-stage pipeline. Our model, MolmoAct, encodes observations and instructions into depth-aware perception tokens, generates mid-level spatial plans as editable trajectory traces, and predicts precise low-level actions, enabling explainable and steerable behavior. MolmoAct-7B-D achieves strong performance across simulation and real-world settings: 70.5% zero-shot accuracy on SimplerEnv Visual Matching tasks, surpassing closed-source Pi-0 and GR00T N1.5; 86.6% average success on LIBERO, including an additional 6.3% gain over ThinkAct on long-horizon tasks; and in real-world fine-tuning, an additional 10% (single-arm) and an additional 22.7% (bimanual) task progression over Pi-0-FAST. It also outperforms baselines by an additional 23.3% on out-of-distribution generalization and achieves top human-preference scores for open-ended instruction following and trajectory steering. Furthermore, we release, for the first time, the MolmoAct Dataset -- a mid-training robot dataset comprising over 10,000 high quality robot trajectories across diverse scenarios and tasks. Training with this dataset yields an average 5.5% improvement in general performance over the base model. We release all model weights, training code, our collected dataset, and our action reasoning dataset, establishing MolmoAct as both a state-of-the-art robotics foundation model and an open blueprint for building ARMs that transform perception into purposeful action through structured reasoning.

For a particular signal decay, the process for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic method exists. This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective, we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token sequences representing decays.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figures |

It cuts normalized Time by ~2x and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates, improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing methods.

This is achieved by designing a sampling operator by an optimization problem, which is inherently non-convex, as the best possible recovery imposes a rank constraint. An existing method for vertex-wise flexible sampling is able to control the number of active vertices but cannot incorporate prior knowledge of mandatory or forbidden vertices. To address these challenges, we formulate the operator design as a problem that handles a constraint of the number of active vertices and prior knowledge on specific vertices for sampling, mandatory inclusion or exclusion. We transformed this constrained problem into a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization problem by using the nuclear norm and a DC penalty for vertex selection. To solve this, we develop a convergent solver based on the general double-proximal gradient DC algorithm. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experiments on various graph signal models, including real-world data, showing superior performance in the recovery accuracy by comparing to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing</p></details> |

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and real-time efficiency.

We propose a stochastic distributed zeroth-order algorithm (Com-DSZO) requiring only two function evaluations per iteration, integrated with general compression operators. Rigorous analysis establishes its sublinear convergence rate for both smooth and nonsmooth objectives, while explicitly elucidating the compression-convergence trade-off. Furthermore, we develop a variance-reduced variant (VR-Com-DSZO) under stochastic mini-batch feedback. The empirical algorithm performance are illustrated with numerical examples.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Trainability of Quantum Models Beyond Known Classical Simulability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06344v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term quantum computing, yet they face scalability challenges due to barren plateaus, where gradients vanish exponentially in the system size. Recent conjectures suggest that avoiding barren plateaus might inherently lead to classical simulability, thus limiting the opportunities for quantum advantage. In this work, we advance the theoretical understanding of the relationship between the trainability and computational complexity of VQAs, thus directly addressing the conjecture. We introduce the Linear Clifford Encoder (LCE), a novel technique that ensures constant-scaling gradient statistics on optimization landscape regions that are close to Clifford circuits. Additionally, we leverage classical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase transitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region size increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between trainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren plateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to exist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm in practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone'' where gradients decay polynomially. These findings indicate a plausible path to practically relevant, barren plateau-free variational models with potential for quantum advantage.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 59 pages of supplementary material</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on model merging by leveraging the fundamental mechanisms of neural network representation. Our approach is motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, which states that neural networks encode information through linear combinations of feature vectors. We propose a method that superposes task-specific features from individual models into a merged model. Our approach specifically targets linear transformation matrices, which are crucial for feature activation and extraction in deep networks. By formulating the merging process as a linear system, we can preserve task-specific features from individual models and create merged models that effectively maintain multi-task capabilities compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques.

In this paper, we introduce a novel video clipping strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These clipped frames are then processed by three existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain human skeletal joints, another for shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and the other for court line detection to determine player positions on the court. Leveraging these data as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset (ShuttleSet), another badminton dataset (BadmintonDB), and a tennis dataset (TenniSet). These results suggest that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is a promising direction for action recognition in racket sports.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main paper, 2 pages references, 8 pages supplementary material</p></details> |

Most existing methods disregard compression artifacts removal or hardly establish a unified framework for joint task enhancement of low-light images with varying compression qualities. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid priors-guided network (HPGN) that enhances compressed low-light images by integrating both compression and illumination priors. Our approach fully utilizes the JPEG quality factor (QF) and DCT quantization matrix to guide the design of efficient plug-and-play modules for joint tasks. Additionally, we employ a random QF generation strategy to guide model training, enabling a single model to enhance low-light images with different compression levels. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method..</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

In this paper, we introduce HArnESS, the first Arabic-centric self-supervised speech model family, designed to capture Arabic speech nuances. Using iterative self-distillation, we train large bilingual HArnESS (HL) SSL models and then distill knowledge into compressed student models (HS, HST), preserving Arabic-specific representations. We use low-rank approximation to further compact the teacher's discrete supervision into shallow, thin models. We evaluate HArnESS on Arabic ASR, Speaker Emotion Recognition (SER), and Dialect Identification (DID), demonstrating effectiveness against HuBERT and XLS-R. With minimal fine-tuning, HArnESS achieves SOTA or comparable performance, making it a lightweight yet powerful alternative for real-world use. We release our distilled models and findings to support responsible research and deployment in low-resource settings.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance.

| **[Stochastic Clock Attention for Aligning Continuous and Ordered Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14678v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate an attention mechanism for continuous and ordered sequences that explicitly functions as an alignment model, which serves as the core of many sequence-to-sequence tasks. Standard scaled dot-product attention relies on positional encodings and masks but does not enforce continuity or monotonicity, which are crucial for frame-synchronous targets. We propose learned nonnegative \emph{clocks} to source and target and model attention as the meeting probability of these clocks; a path-integral derivation yields a closed-form, Gaussian-like scoring rule with an intrinsic bias toward causal, smooth, near-diagonal alignments, without external positional regularizers. The framework supports two complementary regimes: normalized clocks for parallel decoding when a global length is available, and unnormalized clocks for autoregressive decoding -- both nearly-parameter-free, drop-in replacements. In a Transformer text-to-speech testbed, this construction produces more stable alignments and improved robustness to global time-scaling while matching or improving accuracy over scaled dot-product baselines. We hypothesize applicability to other continuous targets, including video and temporal signal modeling.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

We extend them with a trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy trade-off.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 Figures |

In this work, we address these challenges within the trusted aggregator model by introducing a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), achieving both objectives simultaneously. In particular, CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a construction of randomized vector quantizer whose resulting distortion is equivalent to a prescribed noise, such as Gaussian or Laplace noise, enabling joint differential privacy and compression. Our CEPAM provides the additional benefit of privacy adaptability, allowing clients and the server to customize privacy protection based on required accuracy and protection. We theoretically analyze the privacy guarantee of CEPAM and investigate the trade-offs among user privacy and accuracy of CEPAM through experimental evaluations. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance using MNIST dataset, demonstrating that CEPAM surpasses baseline models in terms of learning accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

While smartphone-based AR is more accessible, it remains limited to handheld, single-user interaction. We introduce Chameleon, a prototype AR system that transforms smartphones into surface-anchored displays for co-located use. When placed flat, the phone creates a transparency illusion and anchors digital content visible to multiple users. Chameleon supports natural repositioning on the surface without external hardware by combining two techniques: (1) Background Acquisition uses opportunistic sensing and language model-assisted pattern generation to blend with surrounding surfaces, and (2) Real-Time Position Tracking augments inertial sensing to maintain spatial stability. This work shows how lightweight sensing can support casual, collaborative AR experiences using existing devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 1 figure, ACM UIST 2025 Poster</p></details> |
| **[Learning the symmetric group: large from small](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12717v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning explorations can make significant inroads into solving difficult problems in pure mathematics. One advantage of this approach is that mathematical datasets do not suffer from noise, but a challenge is the amount of data required to train these models and that this data can be computationally expensive to generate. Key challenges further comprise difficulty in a posteriori interpretation of statistical models and the implementation of deep and abstract mathematical problems. We propose a method for scalable tasks, by which models trained on simpler versions of a task can then generalize to the full task. Specifically, we demonstrate that a transformer neural-network trained on predicting permutations from words formed by general transpositions in the symmetric group $S_{10}$ can generalize to the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with near 100\% accuracy. We also show that $S_{10}$ generalizes to $S_{16}$ with similar performance if we only use adjacent transpositions. We employ identity augmentation as a key tool to manage variable word lengths, and partitioned windows for training on adjacent transpositions. Finally we compare variations of the method used and discuss potential challenges with extending the method to other tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

However, the lack of large datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally, we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2), or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

Diffusion-based language models offer a promising alternative, as they can decode multiple tokens in parallel. However, we identify a key bottleneck in current diffusion LMs: the long decoding-window problem, where tokens generated far from the input context often become irrelevant or repetitive. Previous solutions like semi-autoregressive address this issue by splitting windows into blocks, but this sacrifices speed and bidirectionality, eliminating the main advantage of diffusion models. To overcome this, we propose Convolutional decoding (Conv), a normalization-based method that narrows the decoding window without hard segmentation, leading to better fluency and flexibility. Additionally, we introduce Rejecting Rule-based Fine-Tuning (R2FT), a post-hoc training scheme that better aligns tokens at positions far from context. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results on open-ended generation benchmarks (e.g., AlpacaEval) among diffusion LM baselines, with significantly lower step size than previous works, demonstrating both speed and quality improvements.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 spotlight</p></details> |

Several recent studies indicate that adapting precision levels across different parameters can maintain accuracy comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing computational demands. However, existing embedded microprocessors lack sufficient architectural support for efficiently executing mixed-precision NNs, both in terms of ISA extensions and hardware design, resulting in inefficiencies such as excessive data packing/unpacking and underutilized arithmetic units. In this work, we propose novel ISA extensions and a micro-architecture implementation specifically designed to optimize mixed-precision execution, enabling energy-efficient deep learning inference on RISC-V architectures. We introduce MaRVIn, a cross-layer hardware-software co-design framework that enhances power efficiency and performance through a combination of hardware improvements, mixed-precision quantization, ISA-level optimizations, and cycle-accurate emulation. At the hardware level, we enhance the ALU with configurable mixed-precision arithmetic (2, 4, 8 bits) for weights/activations and employ multi-pumping to reduce execution latency while implementing soft SIMD for efficient 2-bit ops. At the software level, we integrate a pruning-aware fine-tuning method to optimize model compression and a greedy-based DSE approach to efficiently search for Pareto-optimal mixed-quantized models. Additionally, we incorporate voltage scaling to boost the power efficiency of our system. Our experimental evaluation over widely used DNNs and datasets, such as CIFAR10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that our framework can achieve, on average, 17.6x speedup for less than 1% accuracy loss and outperforms the ISA-agnostic state-of-the-art RISC-V cores, delivering up to 1.8 TOPs/W.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, March 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Prior-based Non-stationary Channel Estimation Using Accelerated Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15182v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wireless channels in motion-rich urban microcell (UMi) settings are non-stationary; mobility and scatterer dynamics shift the distribution over time, degrading classical and deep estimators. This work proposes conditional prior diffusion for channel estimation, which learns a history-conditioned score to denoise noisy channel snapshots. A temporal encoder with cross-time attention compresses a short observation window into a context vector, which captures the channel's instantaneous coherence and steers the denoiser via feature-wise modulation. In inference, an SNR-matched initialization selects the diffusion step whose marginal aligns with the measured input SNR, and the process follows a shortened, geometrically spaced schedule, preserving the signal-to-noise trajectory with far fewer iterations. Temporal self-conditioning with the previous channel estimate and a training-only smoothness penalty further stabilizes evolution without biasing the test-time estimator. Evaluations on a 3GPP benchmark show lower NMSE across all SNRs than LMMSE, GMM, LSTM, and LDAMP baselines, demonstrating stable performance and strong high SNR fidelity.</p></details> | ICASSP 2026 |

We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles, and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11 maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables.

It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth, bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts. We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

We introduce A1 (Asynchronous Test-Time Scaling), a statistically guaranteed adaptive inference framework that addresses these challenges. A1 refines arithmetic intensity to identify synchronization as the dominant bottleneck, proposes an online calibration strategy to enable asynchronous inference, and designs a three-stage rejection sampling pipeline that supports both sequential and parallel scaling. Through experiments on the MATH, AMC23, AIME24, and AIME25 datasets, across various draft-target model families, we demonstrate that A1 achieves a remarkable 56.7x speedup in test-time scaling and a 4.14x improvement in throughput, all while maintaining accurate rejection-rate control, reducing latency and memory overhead, and no accuracy loss compared to using target model scaling alone. These results position A1 as an efficient and principled solution for scalable LLM inference.

However, this potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Webpage: https://worldforge-agi.github.io/</p></details> |

Integrating partial differential equation (PDE) based physics knowledge with machine learning provides enhanced interpretability and utility over classic numerical methods. However, current physics-integrated machine learning methods are limited to considering a single PDE, severely limiting their application to diseases where multiple mechanisms are responsible for different groups (i.e., subtypes) and aggravating problems with model misspecification and degeneracy. Here, we present a deep generative model for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-based PDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure. Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder (VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes of interpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) from neuroimaging data.

This separation can limit the ability of models to generalize across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose a query-free RAG system, named ImpRAG, which integrates retrieval and generation into a unified model. ImpRAG allows models to implicitly express their information needs, eliminating the need for human-specified queries. By dividing pretrained decoder-only language models into specialized layer groups, ImpRAG optimizes retrieval and generation tasks simultaneously. Our approach employs a two-stage inference process, using the same model parameters and forward pass for both retrieval and generation, thereby minimizing the disparity between retrievers and language models. Experiments on 8 knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that ImpRAG achieves 3.6-11.5 improvements in exact match scores on unseen tasks with diverse formats, highlighting its effectiveness in enabling models to articulate their own information needs and generalize across tasks. Our analysis underscores the importance of balancing retrieval and generation parameters and leveraging generation perplexities as retrieval training objectives for enhanced performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[TDRM: Smooth Reward Models with Temporal Difference for LLM RL and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15110v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

Traditional gradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative updates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based direct equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural network into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step equation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction, while higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual updates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce the Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both hierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning with minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive decision-making through energy-aware updates. This integrated design enhances scalability, reduces redundant computation, and aligns with the principles of sustainable AI. Theoretical analysis and architectural insights demonstrate that our method reduces computational costs significantly while preserving high model performance, making it well-suited for edge deployment and real-time adaptation in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

This paper proposes an AI-driven agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model (VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility, clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time inference on edge platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous. In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end. Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward collaborative embodied agents.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as NeurIPS 2025 spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Alternative Likelihood Approximations for High-Dimensional Intervals for Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14971v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical frequentist approaches to inference for the lasso emphasize exact coverage for each feature, which requires debiasing and severs the connection between confidence intervals and the original lasso estimates. To address this, in earlier work we introduced the idea of average coverage, allowing for biased intervals that align with the lasso point estimates, and proposed the Relaxed Lasso Posterior (RL-P) intervals, which leverage the Bayesian interpretation of the lasso penalty as a Laplace prior together with a Normal likelihood conditional on the selected features. While RL-P achieves approximate average coverage, its intervals need not contain the lasso estimates. In this work, we propose alternative constructions based on different likelihood approximations to the full high-dimensional likelihood, yielding intervals that remain centered on the lasso estimates while still achieving average coverage. Our results continue to demonstrate that intentionally biased intervals provide a principled and practically useful framework for inference in high-dimensional regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

As the need for intelligence grows, networks must learn to better understand the physical world. However, deploying dedicated hardware to perceive the environment is not always feasible, mainly due to costs and/or complexity. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has made a step forward in addressing this challenge. Within ISAC, passive sensing emerges as a cost-effective solution that reuses wireless communications to sense the environment, without interfering with existing communications. Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are limited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum accuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we see a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage area. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a MultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference. FAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information from Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical world without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution, we have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show errors below 0.6 m around 84% of times.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures and tables, less than 5500 words.

Prior approaches to patent NLP have primarily relied on fine-tuning general-purpose models or domain-adapted variants pretrained with limited data. In this work, we pretrain 3 domain-specific masked language models for patents, using the ModernBERT architecture and a curated corpus of over 60 million patent records. Our approach incorporates architectural optimizations, including FlashAttention, rotary embeddings, and GLU feed-forward layers. We evaluate our models on four downstream patent classification tasks. Our model, ModernBERT-base-PT, consistently outperforms the general-purpose ModernBERT baseline on three out of four datasets and achieves competitive performance with a baseline PatentBERT. Additional experiments with ModernBERT-base-VX and Mosaic-BERT-large demonstrate that scaling the model size and customizing the tokenizer further enhance performance on selected tasks. Notably, all ModernBERT variants retain substantially faster inference over - 3x that of PatentBERT - underscoring their suitability for time-sensitive applications. These results underscore the benefits of domain-specific pretraining and architectural improvements for patent-focused NLP tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[FURINA: Free from Unmergeable Router via LINear Aggregation of mixed experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14900v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm has been successfully integrated into Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), delivering performance gains with minimal parameter overhead. However, a key limitation of existing MoE-LoRA methods is their reliance on a discrete router, which prevents the integration of the MoE components into the backbone model. To overcome this, we propose FURINA, a novel Free from Unmergeable Router framework based on the LINear Aggregation of experts. FURINA eliminates the router by introducing a Self-Routing mechanism. This is achieved through three core innovations: (1) decoupled learning of the direction and magnitude for LoRA adapters, (2) a shared learnable magnitude vector for consistent activation scaling, and (3) expert selection loss that encourages divergent expert activation. The proposed mechanism leverages the angular similarity between the input and each adapter's directional component to activate experts, which are then scaled by the shared magnitude vector. This design allows the output norm to naturally reflect the importance of each expert, thereby enabling dynamic, router-free routing. The expert selection loss further sharpens this behavior by encouraging sparsity and aligning it with standard MoE activation patterns. We also introduce a shared expert within the MoE-LoRA block that provides stable, foundational knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, FURINA is the first router-free, MoE-enhanced LoRA method that can be fully merged into the backbone model, introducing zero additional inference-time cost or complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FURINA not only significantly outperforms standard LoRA but also matches or surpasses the performance of existing MoE-LoRA methods, while eliminating the extra inference-time overhead of MoE.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from transiting systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |

A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |

We conduct experiments in the agent self-improving benchmark, OpenWebVoyager, and demonstrate that distilling salient reasoning patterns into the backbone LLM via simple fine-tuning can substantially enhance its performance. Our approach yields significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including WebVoyager, Mind2web-live, and SimpleQA (web search), highlighting the potential of targeted reasoning skill enhancement for web agents.</p></details> | 18 pages |

In this work, we propose UniTracker, a three-stage training framework that enables robust and scalable motion tracking across a wide range of human behaviors. In the first stage, we train a teacher policy with privileged observations to generate high-quality actions. In the second stage, we introduce a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model a universal student policy that can be deployed directly on real hardware. The CVAE structure allows the policy to learn a global latent representation of motion, enhancing generalization to unseen behaviors and addressing the limitations of standard MLP-based policies under partial observations. Unlike pure MLPs that suffer from drift in global attributes like orientation, our CVAE-student policy incorporates global intent during training by aligning a partial-observation prior to the full-observation encoder. In the third stage, we introduce a fast adaptation module that fine-tunes the universal policy on harder motion sequences that are difficult to track directly. This adaptation can be performed both for single sequences and in batch mode, further showcasing the flexibility and scalability of our approach. We evaluate UniTracker in both simulation and real-world settings using a Unitree G1 humanoid, demonstrating strong performance in motion diversity, tracking accuracy, and deployment robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>three...</summary><p>three-stage universal motion tracker for humanoid robots</p></details> |

For the data-efficient strategy, we analyze hard prompting with zero-shot and few-shot inferences to analyze the dialect identification capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). For the parameter-efficient PEFT approaches, we conducted our experiments using Arabic-specific encoder models on several major datasets. We also analyzed the n-shot inferences on open-source decoder-only models, a general multilingual model (Phi-3.5), and an Arabic-specific one(SILMA). We observed that the LLMs generally struggle to differentiate the dialectal nuances in the few-shot or zero-shot setups. The soft-prompted encoder variants perform better, while the LoRA-based fine-tuned models perform best, even surpassing full fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 mai...</summary><p>4 main pages, 4 additional, 5 figures</p></details> |

It is fair to say that a general definition has remained elusive. In this paper we start with a representation of Bayesian posterior distributions provided by Doob that relies on martingales. This is explicit in defining how a true parameter value should depend on a random sample and hence an approach to "inverse probability" as originally conceived by Fisher. Taking this as our cue, we introduce a definition of fiducial inference that can be regarded as general.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

By leveraging separate speaker and environment prompts, DAIEN-TTS allows independent control over the timbre and the background environment of the synthesized speech. Built upon F5-TTS, the proposed DAIEN-TTS first incorporates a pretrained speech-environment separation (SES) module to disentangle the environmental speech into mel-spectrograms of clean speech and environment audio. Two random span masks of varying lengths are then applied to both mel-spectrograms, which, together with the text embedding, serve as conditions for infilling the masked environmental mel-spectrogram, enabling the simultaneous continuation of personalized speech and time-varying environmental audio. To further enhance controllability during inference, we adopt dual class-free guidance (DCFG) for the speech and environment components and introduce a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptation strategy to align the synthesized speech with the environment prompt. Experimental results demonstrate that DAIEN-TTS generates environmental personalized speech with high naturalness, strong speaker similarity, and high environmental fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, current methods exhibit limited performance when handling hypergraphs, which inherently represent complex high-order relationships beyond pairwise connections. Partitioning hypergraph structures across federated subsystems amplifies structural complexity, hindering high-order information mining and compromising local information integrity. To bridge the gap between hypergraph learning and federated systems, we develop FedHGL, a first-of-its-kind framework for federated hypergraph learning on disjoint and privacy-constrained hypergraph partitions. Beyond collaboratively training a comprehensive hypergraph neural network across multiple clients, FedHGL introduces a pre-propagation hyperedge completion mechanism to preserve high-order structural integrity within each client. This procedure leverages the federated central server to perform cross-client hypergraph convolution without exposing internal topological information, effectively mitigating the high-order information loss induced by subgraph partitioning. Furthermore, by incorporating two kinds of local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, we provide formal privacy guarantees for this process, ensuring that sensitive node features remain protected against inference attacks from potentially malicious servers or clients. Experimental results on seven real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its performance advantages over traditional federated graph learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (ICDM2025)</p></details> |

| **[SALT4Decompile: Inferring Source-level Abstract Logic Tree for LLM-Based Binary Decompilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14646v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilation is widely used in reverse engineering to recover high-level language code from binary executables. While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of \saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, \saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \salt to generate decompiled code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques.

New methods must capture temporal oscillations and emergent spatiotemporal patterns while adhering to conservation principles. We present the Unified Spatiotemporal Physics-Informed Learning (USPIL) framework, a deep learning architecture integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and conservation laws to model predator-prey dynamics across dimensional scales. The framework provides a unified solution for both ordinary (ODE) and partial (PDE) differential equation systems, describing temporal cycles and reaction-diffusion patterns within a single neural network architecture. Our methodology uses automatic differentiation to enforce physics constraints and adaptive loss weighting to balance data fidelity with physical consistency. Applied to the Lotka-Volterra system, USPIL achieves 98.9% correlation for 1D temporal dynamics (loss: 0.0219, MAE: 0.0184) and captures complex spiral waves in 2D systems (loss: 4.7656, pattern correlation: 0.94). Validation confirms conservation law adherence within 0.5% and shows a 10-50x computational speedup for inference compared to numerical solvers. USPIL also enables mechanistic understanding through interpretable physics constraints, facilitating parameter discovery and sensitivity analysis not possible with purely data-driven methods. Its ability to transition between dimensional formulations opens new avenues for multi-scale ecological modeling. These capabilities make USPIL a transformative tool for ecological forecasting, conservation planning, and understanding ecosystem resilience, establishing physics-informed deep learning as a powerful and scientifically rigorous paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 11 figures.

| **[SynBench: A Benchmark for Differentially Private Text Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14594v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven decision support in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance faces significant barriers to data sharing due to regulatory, institutional, and privacy concerns. While recent generative AI models, such as large language models, have shown impressive performance in open-domain tasks, their adoption in sensitive environments remains limited by unpredictable behaviors and insufficient privacy-preserving datasets for benchmarking. Existing anonymization methods are often inadequate, especially for unstructured text, as redaction and masking can still allow re-identification. Differential Privacy (DP) offers a principled alternative, enabling the generation of synthetic data with formal privacy assurances. In this work, we address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework with standardized utility and fidelity metrics, encompassing nine curated datasets that capture domain-specific complexities such as technical jargon, long-context dependencies, and specialized document structures. Second, we conduct a large-scale empirical study benchmarking state-of-the-art DP text generation methods and LLMs of varying sizes and different fine-tuning strategies, revealing that high-quality domain-specific synthetic data generation under DP constraints remains an unsolved challenge, with performance degrading as domain complexity increases. Third, we develop a membership inference attack (MIA) methodology tailored for synthetic text, providing first empirical evidence that the use of public datasets - potentially present in pre-training corpora - can invalidate claimed privacy guarantees. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rigorous privacy auditing and highlight persistent gaps between open-domain and specialist evaluations, informing responsible deployment of generative AI in privacy-sensitive, high-stakes settings.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Cross-Lingual F5-TTS: Towards Language-Agnostic Voice Cloning and Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14579v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-matching-based text-to-speech (TTS) models have shown high-quality speech synthesis. However, most current flow-matching-based TTS models still rely on reference transcripts corresponding to the audio prompt for synthesis. This dependency prevents cross-lingual voice cloning when audio prompt transcripts are unavailable, particularly for unseen languages. The key challenges for flow-matching-based TTS models to remove audio prompt transcripts are identifying word boundaries during training and determining appropriate duration during inference. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Lingual F5-TTS, a framework that enables cross-lingual voice cloning without audio prompt transcripts. Our method preprocesses audio prompts by forced alignment to obtain word boundaries, enabling direct synthesis from audio prompts while excluding transcripts during training. To address the duration modeling challenge, we train speaking rate predictors at different linguistic granularities to derive duration from speaker pace. Experiments show that our approach matches the performance of F5-TTS while enabling cross-lingual voice cloning.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

| **[From Judgment to Interference: Early Stopping LLM Harmful Outputs via Streaming Content Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09996v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models (LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, and 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[DGS-LRM: Real-Time Deformable 3D Gaussian Reconstruction From Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09997v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model (DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hubert0527.github.io/dgslrm/</p></details> |
| **[Flipping Against All Odds: Reducing LLM Coin Flip Bias via Verbalized Rejection Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09998v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations, and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report v1 (21 pages, 14 figures)</p></details> |
| **[PlayerOne: Egocentric World Simulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09995v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator, facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme, enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation. Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world modeling and its diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://playerone-hku.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EVINET: Towards Open-World Graph Learning via Evidential Reasoning Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07288v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph learning has been crucial to many real-world tasks, but they are often studied with a closed-world assumption, with all possible labels of data known a priori. To enable effective graph learning in an open and noisy environment, it is critical to inform the model users when the model makes a wrong prediction to in-distribution data of a known class, i.e., misclassification detection or when the model encounters out-of-distribution from novel classes, i.e., out-of-distribution detection. This paper introduces Evidential Reasoning Network (EVINET), a framework that addresses these two challenges by integrating Beta embedding within a subjective logic framework. EVINET includes two key modules: Dissonance Reasoning for misclassification detection and Vacuity Reasoning for out-of-distribution detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVINET outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics in the tasks of in-distribution classification, misclassification detection, and out-of-distribution detection. EVINET demonstrates the necessity of uncertainty estimation and logical reasoning for misclassification detection and out-of-distribution detection and paves the way for open-world graph learning.

| **[Text-Aware Image Restoration with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09993v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

| **[Large Language Models for Toxic Language Detection in Low-Resource Balkan Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09992v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music, politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1 score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of 0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for underserved Balkan language communities.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Hearing Hands: Generating Sounds from Physical Interactions in 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09989v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds.

| **[V-JEPA 2: Self-Supervised Video Models Enable Understanding, Prediction and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09985v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data (robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting, and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models. Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals. Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in the physical world.</p></details> | 48 pages, 19 figures |

However, standard prompting often struggles to produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17 languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative to bracket-based approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, accepted for SyntaxFest 2025</p></details> |
| **[AnimateAnyMesh: A Feed-Forward 4D Foundation Model for Text-Driven Universal Mesh Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09982v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention, yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes. Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency. Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://animateanymesh.github.io/AnimateAnyMesh/</p></details> |
| **[ReSim: Reliable World Simulation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09981v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/ReSim</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Part-level 3D Object Generation via Dual Volume Packing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09980v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than previous image-based part-level generation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/NVlabs/PartPacker Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/partpacker/</p></details> |

The hybrid nature of the system introduces a combination of discrete and continuous variables which causes issues for numerical optimal control. To address these challenges, we propose a layered architecture that separates the choice of discrete variables and a smooth Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The layered formulation allows for online flexibility and optimality without sacrificing real-time performance through a combination of gradient-free and gradient-based methods. The architecture leverages a sampling-based method for determining discrete variables, and a classical smooth MPC formulation using these fixed discrete variables. We demonstrate the results on a quadrupedal robot stepping over gaps and onto terrain with varying heights. In simulation, we demonstrate the controller on a humanoid robot for gap traversal. The layered approach is shown to be more optimal and reliable than common heuristic-based approaches and faster to compute than pure sampling methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Humanoids 2025</p></details> |

It is nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing) particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally applicable and realistic LLM use case.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in ACL Findings</p></details> |

Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v6)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, VLDB 2025</p></details> |

We investigate how extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning skills of underlying LLMs influence this strong performance. Surprisingly, we discover that LLM-based approaches can yield surprisingly good accuracy on long-video tasks with limited video information, sometimes even with no video specific information. Building on this, we explore injecting video-specific information into an LLM-based framework. We utilize off-the-shelf vision tools to extract three object-centric information modalities from videos, and then leverage natural language as a medium for fusing this information. Our resulting Multimodal Video Understanding (MVU) framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple video understanding benchmarks. Strong performance also on robotics domain tasks establish its strong generality.

Insufficient SRL skills can lead to disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management, undermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a formative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges students face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with goal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these challenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL skills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models (LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables students to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection within an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time feedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study efforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to a baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia learning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills within the SRLAgent group (p < .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement compared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL scaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering design implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper learning and metacognitive skill development.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications.

The conventional approach for regression involves employing loss functions that primarily concentrate on aligning model prediction with the ground truth for each individual data sample. Recent research endeavors have introduced novel perspectives by incorporating label similarity to regression via imposing extra pairwise regularization on the latent feature space and demonstrated the effectiveness. However, there are two drawbacks for those approaches: i) their pairwise operation in latent feature space is computationally more expensive than conventional regression losses; ii) it lacks of theoretical justifications behind such regularization. In this work, we propose GAR (Gradient Aligned Regression) as a competitive alternative method in label space, which is constituted by a conventional regression loss and two pairwise label difference losses for gradient alignment including magnitude and direction. GAR enjoys: i) the same level efficiency as conventional regression loss because the quadratic complexity for the proposed pairwise losses can be reduced to linear complexity; ii) theoretical insights from learning the pairwise label difference to learning the gradient of the ground truth function. We limit our current scope as regression on the clean data setting without noises, outliers or distributional shifts, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method practically on two synthetic datasets and on eight extensive real-world tasks from six benchmark datasets with other eight competitive baselines. Running time experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed GAR over existing methods with pairwise regularization in latent feature space and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each component for GAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025; 23 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to prompt injection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/llmail-inject-challenge</p></details> |
| **[Canonical Latent Representations in Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09955v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM features preserve essential categorical information while discarding non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that can drive robust representation learning.</p></details> | 45 pages,41 figures |
| **[Language Models Resist Alignment: Evidence From Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06144v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment. The model weight and code are available at pku-lm-resist-alignment.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Vision Generalist Model: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09954v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field. First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks. Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV)</p></details> |

Currently, there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud models as backbones.

| **[Scalable First-order Method for Certifying Optimal k-Sparse GLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09502v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of certifying optimality for sparse generalized linear models (GLMs), where sparsity is enforced through an $\ell_0$ cardinality constraint. While branch-and-bound (BnB) frameworks can certify optimality by pruning nodes using dual bounds, existing methods for computing these bounds are either computationally intensive or exhibit slow convergence, limiting their scalability to large-scale problems. To address this challenge, we propose a first-order proximal gradient algorithm designed to solve the perspective relaxation of the problem within a BnB framework. Specifically, we formulate the relaxed problem as a composite optimization problem and demonstrate that the proximal operator of the non-smooth component can be computed exactly in log-linear time complexity, eliminating the need to solve a computationally expensive second-order cone program. Furthermore, we introduce a simple restart strategy that enhances convergence speed while maintaining low per-iteration complexity. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly accelerates dual bound computations and is highly effective in providing optimality certificates for large-scale problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 camera ready, typo fixed</p></details> |

For block models with $n$ vertices and a fixed number of communities $q$, it was predicted in Decelle et al. (2011) that there are computationally efficient algorithms for recovering the communities above the Kesten--Stigum (KS) bound and that efficient recovery is impossible below the KS bound. This conjecture has since stimulated a lot of interest, with the achievability side proven in a line of research that culminated in the work of Abbe and Sandon (2018). Conversely, recent work by Sohn and Wein (2025) provides evidence for the hardness part using the low-degree paradigm. In this paper we investigate community recovery in the regime $q=q_n \to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$ where no such predictions exist. We show that efficient inference of communities remains possible above the KS bound. Furthermore, we show that recovery of block models is low-degree hard below the KS bound when the number of communities satisfies $q\ll \sqrt{n}$. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that when $q \gg \sqrt{n}$, there is an efficient algorithm based on non-backtracking walks for recovery even below the KS bound. We identify a new threshold and ask if it is the threshold for efficient recovery in this regime. Finally, we show that detection is easy and identify (up to a constant) the information-theoretic threshold for community recovery as the number of communities $q$ diverges. Our low-degree hardness results also naturally have consequences for graphon estimation, improving results of Luo and Gao (2024).</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 1 figure, added discussion and minor corrections, extended abstract in COLT 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Comparison between Markov Switching Zero-inflated and Hurdle Models for Spatio-temporal Infectious Disease Counts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04594v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In epidemiological studies, zero-inflated and hurdle models are commonly used to handle excess zeros in reported infectious disease cases. However, they can not model the persistence (changing from presence to presence) and reemergence (changing from absence to presence) of a disease separately. Covariates can sometimes have different effects on the reemergence and persistence of a disease. Recently, a zero-inflated Markov switching negative binomial model was proposed to accommodate this issue. We introduce a Markov switching negative binomial hurdle model as a competitor of that approach, as hurdle models are often also used as alternatives to zero-inflated models for accommodating excess zeroes. We begin the comparison by inspecting the underlying assumptions made by both models. Hurdle models assume perfect detection of the disease cases while zero-inflated models implicitly assume the case counts can be under-reported, thus we investigate when a negative binomial distribution can approximate the true distribution of reported counts. A comparison of the fit of the two types of Markov switching models is undertaken on chikungunya cases across the neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro. We find that, among the fitted models, the Markov switching negative binomial zero-inflated model produces the best predictions and both Markov switching models produce remarkably better predictions than more traditional negative binomial hurdle and zero-inflated models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Statistics in Medicine, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.70135</p></details> |

However, best practices for RL in instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset, VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving significant improvements across several representative instruction-following benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely outcomes of different actions and events through five question types: counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make accurate predictions in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to NeurIPS2025 benchmark track</p></details> |
| **[The Sample Complexity of Online Strategic Decision Making with Information Asymmetry and Knowledge Transportability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09940v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems, especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards. These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d. actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

Yet traditional first-order optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam incur prohibitive memory and computational costs that scale poorly with model size. In this paper, we investigate zero-order (ZO) optimization methods as a memory- and compute-efficient alternative, particularly in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA. We propose $\texttt{JAGUAR SignSGD}$, a ZO momentum-based algorithm that extends ZO SignSGD, requiring the same number of parameters as the standard ZO SGD and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ function evaluations per iteration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to establish rigorous convergence guarantees for SignSGD in the stochastic ZO case. We further propose $\texttt{JAGUAR Muon}$, a novel ZO extension of the Muon optimizer that leverages the matrix structure of model parameters, and we provide its convergence rate under arbitrary stochastic noise. Through extensive experiments on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms meet or exceed the convergence quality of standard first-order methods, achieving significant memory reduction. Our theoretical and empirical results establish new ZO optimization methods as a practical and theoretically grounded approach for resource-constrained LLM adaptation.

Manual approaches face difficulties in maintaining consistent multilingual terminology. To address this, we introduce LLM-BT, a back-translation framework powered by large language models (LLMs) designed to automate terminology verification and standardization through cross-lingual semantic alignment. Our key contributions include: (1) term-level consistency validation: by performing English -> intermediate language -> English back-translation, LLM-BT achieves high term consistency across different models (such as GPT-4, DeepSeek, and Grok). Case studies demonstrate over 90 percent of terms are preserved either exactly or semantically; (2) multi-path verification workflow: we develop a novel pipeline described as Retrieve -> Generate -> Verify -> Optimize, which supports both serial paths (e.g., English -> Simplified Chinese -> Traditional Chinese -> English) and parallel paths (e.g., English -> Chinese / Portuguese -> English). BLEU scores and term-level accuracy indicate strong cross-lingual robustness, with BLEU scores exceeding 0.45 and Portuguese term accuracy reaching 100 percent; (3) back-translation as semantic embedding: we reinterpret back-translation as a form of dynamic semantic embedding that uncovers latent trajectories of meaning. In contrast to static embeddings, LLM-BT offers transparent, path-based embeddings shaped by the evolution of the models. This reframing positions back-translation as an active mechanism for multilingual terminology standardization, fostering collaboration between machines and humans - machines preserve semantic integrity, while humans provide cultural interpretation.</p></details> | 23 pages |

For this dataset and with quantum noise limited input, test accuracies of : over 91% and 93% are found for propagation in the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes respectively. Our results also suggest that quantum noise on the input pulses introduces an intrinsic penalty to ELM performance.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |

To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$, and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction.

To fill this gap, we perform the first study of textual multilingual long-form QA by creating CaLMQA, a dataset of 51.7K culturally specific questions across 23 different languages. We define culturally specific questions as those that refer to concepts unique to one or a few cultures, or have different answers depending on the cultural or regional context. We obtain these questions by crawling naturally-occurring questions from community web forums in high-resource languages, and by hiring native speakers to write questions in under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our data collection methodologies are translation-free, enabling the collection of culturally unique questions like "Kuber iki umwami wa mbere w'uburundi yitwa Ntare?" (Kirundi; English translation: "Why was the first king of Burundi called Ntare (Lion)?"). We evaluate factuality, relevance and surface-level quality of LLM-generated long-form answers, finding that (1) for many languages, even the best models make critical surface-level errors (e.g., answering in the wrong language, repetition), especially for low-resource languages; and (2) answers to culturally specific questions contain more factual errors than answers to culturally agnostic questions -- questions that have consistent meaning and answer across many cultures. We release CaLMQA to facilitate future research in cultural and multilingual long-form QA.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 26 figures.

Despite recent progress, 3D-VL models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness, falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity, and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and robust 3D-VL generalists.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://leo-vl.github.io</p></details> |

Using the template of a standard multigrid V-cycle, we develop a smoother analogous to element-wise block Gauss-Seidel, except the diagonal block inverses are replaced with an approximation that balances the smoothing of the velocity and pressure variables, factoring in the unequal scaling of the various Stokes system operators, and optimised via two-grid local Fourier analysis. We evaluate the performance of the multigrid solver across an extensive range of two- and three-dimensional test problems, including steady-state and unsteady, standard-form and stress-form, single-phase and high-contrast multiphase Stokes problems, with multiple kinds of boundary conditions and various choices of polynomial degree. In the lowest-degree case, i.e., that of piecewise constant pressure fields, we observe reliable multigrid convergence rates, though not especially fast. However, in every other case, we see rapid convergence rates matching those of classical Poisson-style geometric multigrid methods; e.g., 5 iterations reduce the Stokes system residual by 5 to 10 orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 4 algorithms, 1 table</p></details> |

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 4 Pages, 5 Figures |
| **[From Intention to Execution: Probing the Generalization Boundaries of Vision-Language-Action Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09930v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile, "generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions, which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across 10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on closing the perception-to-action gap.

Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors, allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more accurate posterior estimates.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce the Astro-DSB model, a variant of DSB with the pairwise domain assumption tailored for astrophysical dynamics. By investigating its learning process and prediction performance in both physically simulated data and in real observations (the Taurus B213 data), we present two main takeaways. First, from the astrophysical perspective, our proposed paired DSB method improves interpretability, learning efficiency, and prediction performance over conventional astrostatistical and other machine learning methods. Second, from the generative modeling perspective, probabilistic generative modeling reveals improvements over discriminative pixel-to-pixel modeling in Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) testing cases of physical simulations with unseen initial conditions and different dominant physical processes. Our study expands research into diffusion models beyond the traditional visual synthesis application and provides evidence of the models' learning abilities beyond pure data statistics, paving a path for future physics-aware generative models which can align dynamics between machine learning and real (astro)physical systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Despite progress in solution quality and runtime, its complexity and industrial relevance continue to drive research. This dissertation introduces scalable MRPP methods with provable guarantees and practical heuristics. First, we study dense MRPP on 2D grids, relevant to warehouse and parcel systems. We propose the Rubik Table method, achieving $(1 + \delta)$-optimal makespan (with $\delta \in (0, 0.5]$) for up to $\frac{m_1 m_2}{2}$ robots, solving large instances efficiently and setting a new theoretical benchmark. Next, we address real-world MRPP. We design optimal layouts for structured environments (e.g., warehouses, parking systems) and propose a puzzle-based system for dense, deadlock-free autonomous vehicle parking. We also extend MRPP to Reeds-Shepp robots, introducing motion primitives and smoothing techniques to ensure feasible, efficient paths under nonholonomic constraints. Simulations and real-world tests validate the approach in urban driving and robotic transport scenarios.</p></details> | Ph.D. thesis |

Although the term `CPE' suggests colder temperatures are inherently better, the BDL community increasingly recognizes that this is not always the case. Despite this, there remains no systematic method for finding the optimal temperature beyond grid search. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to select the temperature that maximizes test log-predictive density, treating the temperature as a model parameter and estimating it directly from the data. We empirically demonstrate that our method performs comparably to grid search, at a fraction of the cost, across both regression and classification tasks. Finally, we highlight the differing perspectives on CPE between the BDL and Generalized Bayes communities: while the former primarily emphasizes the predictive performance of the PPD, the latter prioritizes the utility of the posterior under model misspecification; these distinct objectives lead to different temperature preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (+5 reference, +17 appendix).

| **[DGS-LRM: Real-Time Deformable 3D Gaussian Reconstruction From Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09997v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model (DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hubert0527.github.io/dgslrm/</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Denoising, Empirical Bayes, and Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09986v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the statistical problem of denoising, Bayes and empirical Bayes methods can "overshrink" their output relative to the latent variables of interest. This work is focused on constrained denoising problems which mitigate such phenomena. At the oracle level, i.e., when the latent variable distribution is assumed known, we apply tools from the theory of optimal transport to characterize the solution to (i) variance-constrained, (ii) distribution-constrained, and (iii) general-constrained denoising problems. At the empirical level, i.e., when the latent variable distribution is not known, we use empirical Bayes methodology to estimate these oracle denoisers. Our approach is modular, and transforms any suitable (unconstrained) empirical Bayes denoiser into a constrained empirical Bayes denoiser. We prove explicit rates of convergence for our proposed methodologies, which both extend and sharpen existing asymptotic results that have previously considered only variance constraints. We apply our methodology in two applications: one in astronomy concerning the relative chemical abundances in a large catalog of red-clump stars, and one in baseball concerning minor- and major league batting skill for rookie players.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 4 figures.

| **[AnimateAnyMesh: A Feed-Forward 4D Foundation Model for Text-Driven Universal Mesh Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09982v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention, yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes. Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds, significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency. Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://animateanymesh.github.io/AnimateAnyMesh/</p></details> |
| **[ReSim: Reliable World Simulation for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09981v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator (e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://opendrivelab.com/ReSim</p></details> |
| **[Language Models Resist Alignment: Evidence From Data Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06144v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment. The model weight and code are available at pku-lm-resist-alignment.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[HadaNorm: Diffusion Transformer Quantization through Mean-Centered Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09932v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 4 Pages, 5 Figures |
| **[EquiCaps: Predictor-Free Pose-Aware Pre-Trained Capsule Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09895v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance. Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing 3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$ of 0.78 on the 3DIEBench rotation prediction benchmark and improving upon SIE and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 $R^2$, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 Figures, 13 Tables</p></details> |

Independent of their domain, modelers require to open, view, edit, transform, save, and configure models as well as to collaborate with others. However, at the time of writing, the top five results when googling ``Online Editor Feature Model'' point to editors that either have minimal functionality, are unmaintained or defunct, or require an offline installation, such as FeatureIDE. In this work we present a preview of our in-development online toolbox for feature modeling, variability.dev. In particular, we showcase our collaborative feature-model editor and our online configurator both of which are built on top of the FeatureIDE library.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at 6th International Workshop on Languages for Modelling Variability (MODEVAR'24) (arXiv:cs/2402.15511). 5 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Network Dynamics-Based Framework for Understanding Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02436v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence call for a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying deep learning. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze learning dynamics through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We redefine the notions of linearity and nonlinearity in neural networks by introducing two fundamental transformation units at the neuron level: order-preserving transformations and non-order-preserving transformations. Different transformation modes lead to distinct collective behaviors in weight vector organization, different modes of information extraction, and the emergence of qualitatively different learning phases. Transitions between these phases may occur during training, accounting for key phenomena such as grokking. To further characterize generalization and structural stability, we introduce the concept of attraction basins in both sample and weight spaces. The distribution of neurons with different transformation modes across layers, along with the structural characteristics of the two types of attraction basins, forms a set of core metrics for analyzing the performance of learning models. Hyperparameters such as depth, width, learning rate, and batch size act as control variables for fine-tuning these metrics. Our framework not only sheds light on the intrinsic advantages of deep learning, but also provides a novel perspective for optimizing network architectures and training strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Regularizing Learnable Feature Extraction for Automatic Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09804v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features. Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2) reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate, node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code. Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[Representation Shattering in Transformers: A Synthetic Study with Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17194v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Editing (KE) algorithms alter models' weights to perform targeted updates to incorrect, outdated, or otherwise unwanted factual associations. However, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' broader factual recall accuracy and diminish their reasoning abilities. Although these studies give insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., performance evaluations on benchmarks, little is understood about why such destructive failures occur. Motivated by this, we define a novel synthetic task in which a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a "structured" knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models on this task, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it degrades models' factual recall and reasoning performance. We further corroborate our findings in naturalistic settings with pre-trained Llama and Mamba models as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Channel Unlabeled Sensing over a Union of Signal Subspaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09773v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025. \copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Learning to Optimize Package Picking for Large-Scale, Real-World Robot Induction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09765v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Warehouse automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving resilience to workforce variability. While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet, which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 19th International Symposium on Experimental Robotics (ISER 2025); 6-10 July 2025, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA; 10 pages</p></details> |

Existing approaches mainly leverage latent variable models, e.g., VQ-VAE, to learn skill abstractions through learned vectors (codebooks), while they suffer from codebook collapse and modeling the causal relationship between learned skills. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{S}kill \textbf{T}raining with \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{R}otation (\textbf{STAR}), a framework that advances both skill learning and composition to complete complex behaviors. Specifically, to prevent codebook collapse, we devise rotation-augmented residual skill quantization (RaRSQ). It encodes relative angles between encoder outputs into the gradient flow by rotation-based gradient mechanism. Points within the same skill code are forced to be either pushed apart or pulled closer together depending on gradient directions. Further, to capture the causal relationship between skills, we present causal skill transformer (CST) which explicitly models dependencies between skill representations through an autoregressive mechanism for coherent action generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of STAR on both LIBERO benchmark and realworld tasks, with around 12\% improvement over the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Decoupling the Image Perception and Multimodal Reasoning for Reasoning Segmentation with Digital Twin Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07943v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning Segmentation (RS) is a multimodal vision-text task that requires segmenting objects based on implicit text queries, demanding both precise visual perception and vision-text reasoning capabilities. Current RS approaches rely on fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) for both perception and reasoning, but their tokenization of images fundamentally disrupts continuous spatial relationships between objects. We introduce DTwinSeger, a novel RS approach that leverages Digital Twin (DT) representation as an intermediate layer to decouple perception from reasoning. Innovatively, DTwinSeger reformulates RS as a two-stage process, where the first transforms the image into a structured DT representation that preserves spatial relationships and semantic properties and then employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to perform explicit reasoning over this representation to identify target objects. We propose a supervised fine-tuning method specifically for LLM with DT representation, together with a corresponding fine-tuning dataset Seg-DT, to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities with DT representations. Experiments show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two image RS benchmarks and three image referring segmentation benchmarks. It yields that DT representation functions as an effective bridge between vision and text, enabling complex multimodal reasoning tasks to be accomplished solely with an LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was submitted without the consent of all co-authors.

| **[The Four Color Theorem for Cell Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09724v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In contrast with original pipeline, our algorithm performs high quality any-to-any cross-lingual voice conversion with only 5 second of reference audio. MKL-VC replaces kNN regression with a factorized optimal transport map in WavLM embedding subspaces, derived from Monge-Kantorovich Linear solution. Factorization addresses non-uniform variance across dimensions, ensuring effective feature transformation. Experiments on LibriSpeech and FLEURS datasets show MKL-VC significantly improves content preservation and robustness with short reference audio, outperforming kNN-VC. MKL-VC achieves performance comparable to FACodec, especially in cross-lingual voice conversion domain.</p></details> | Interspeech 2025 |
| **[LLM2TEA: Agentic AI Designer Finds Innovative Objects with Generative Evolutionary Multitasking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14917v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce LLM-driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm (LLM2TEA), the first agentic AI designer within a generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM) framework that promotes the crossover and synergy of designs from multiple domains, leading to innovative solutions that transcend individual disciplines. Of particular interest is the discovery of objects that are not only innovative but also conform to the physical specifications of the real world in science and engineering. LLM2TEA comprises a large language model to initialize a population of genotypes (defined by text prompts) describing the objects of interest, a text-to-3D generative model to produce phenotypes from these prompts, a classifier to interpret the semantic representations of the objects, and a physics simulation model to assess their physical properties. We propose several novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators to guide the search toward the discovery of high-performing practical objects. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, revealing from 97\% to 174\% improvement in the diversity of innovative objects compared to the present text-to-3D generative model baseline. In addition, more than 73\% of the generated designs have better physical performance than the top 1\% percentile of the designs generated in the baseline. Moreover, LLM2TEA generates designs that are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world applications. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D-printed, emphasizing the proposed approach's capacity to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible physical objects. The designs produced by LLM2TEA meets practical requirements while showcasing creative and innovative features, underscoring its potential applications in complex design optimization and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for review</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is an extended version of our papers presented at the 38th International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2022) and the 24th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL 2022), accepted for publication in Logical Methods in Computer Science journal</p></details> |
| **[Learning Efficient and Generalizable Graph Retriever for Knowledge-Graph Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09645v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3) a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs. Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings, highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability.

We pursue this approach by (1) combining proof structuring and grammar-based tree compression, where we show how they are inherently related, and (2) exploring ways to combine human and automated proof structuring. Our source of human-structured proofs is Metamath, which, based on condensed detachment, naturally provides a view of proofs as terms. A knowledge base is then just a grammar that compresses a set of gigantic proof trees. We present a formal account of this view, an implemented practical toolkit as well as experimental results.</p></details> | Minor corrections |
| **[HSENet: Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network for 3D Medical Vision-Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09634v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space, facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation.

These networks are equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras. Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using significantly fewer optimizable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction.

The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at UAI 2025.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as key enablers in optimizing V2X communication by enhancing network management, predictive analytics, security, and cooperative driving due to their outstanding performance across various domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Learning (GL), and Federated Learning (FL), with particular emphasis on developments from the past two years. Notably, AI, especially GL, has shown remarkable progress and emerging potential in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and intelligence of 6G-V2X systems. Despite these advances, a systematic summary of recent research efforts in this area remains lacking, which this survey aims to address. We analyze their roles in 6G-V2X applications, such as intelligent resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X development. This study aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, engineers, and policymakers working towards realizing intelligent, AI-powered V2X ecosystems in 6G communication.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |

Even when enterprises choose on-premises deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned, stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM performance benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE S&P 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches and datasets predominantly focus on static scenes or rigid transformations, limiting their capacity to handle expressive edits involving dynamic motion. To address this gap, we introduce ByteMorph, a comprehensive framework for instruction-based image editing with an emphasis on non-rigid motions. ByteMorph comprises a large-scale dataset, ByteMorph-6M, and a strong baseline model built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT), named ByteMorpher. ByteMorph-6M includes over 6 million high-resolution image editing pairs for training, along with a carefully curated evaluation benchmark ByteMorph-Bench. Both capture a wide variety of non-rigid motion types across diverse environments, human figures, and object categories. The dataset is constructed using motion-guided data generation, layered compositing techniques, and automated captioning to ensure diversity, realism, and semantic coherence.

| **[Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10482v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages for main text, 23 pages in total, submitted to Neurips, 13 figures</p></details> |

Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, and 9 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos. Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit counterparts and other existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: The first multi-person dialogue video generation method from pairs of reference image and audio via explicit layout-aligned condition injection.

Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications.

For block models with $n$ vertices and a fixed number of communities $q$, it was predicted in Decelle et al. (2011) that there are computationally efficient algorithms for recovering the communities above the Kesten--Stigum (KS) bound and that efficient recovery is impossible below the KS bound. This conjecture has since stimulated a lot of interest, with the achievability side proven in a line of research that culminated in the work of Abbe and Sandon (2018). Conversely, recent work by Sohn and Wein (2025) provides evidence for the hardness part using the low-degree paradigm. In this paper we investigate community recovery in the regime $q=q_n \to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$ where no such predictions exist. We show that efficient inference of communities remains possible above the KS bound. Furthermore, we show that recovery of block models is low-degree hard below the KS bound when the number of communities satisfies $q\ll \sqrt{n}$. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that when $q \gg \sqrt{n}$, there is an efficient algorithm based on non-backtracking walks for recovery even below the KS bound. We identify a new threshold and ask if it is the threshold for efficient recovery in this regime. Finally, we show that detection is easy and identify (up to a constant) the information-theoretic threshold for community recovery as the number of communities $q$ diverges. Our low-degree hardness results also naturally have consequences for graphon estimation, improving results of Luo and Gao (2024).</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 1 figure, added discussion and minor corrections, extended abstract in COLT 2025</p></details> |

Using the template of a standard multigrid V-cycle, we develop a smoother analogous to element-wise block Gauss-Seidel, except the diagonal block inverses are replaced with an approximation that balances the smoothing of the velocity and pressure variables, factoring in the unequal scaling of the various Stokes system operators, and optimised via two-grid local Fourier analysis. We evaluate the performance of the multigrid solver across an extensive range of two- and three-dimensional test problems, including steady-state and unsteady, standard-form and stress-form, single-phase and high-contrast multiphase Stokes problems, with multiple kinds of boundary conditions and various choices of polynomial degree. In the lowest-degree case, i.e., that of piecewise constant pressure fields, we observe reliable multigrid convergence rates, though not especially fast. However, in every other case, we see rapid convergence rates matching those of classical Poisson-style geometric multigrid methods; e.g., 5 iterations reduce the Stokes system residual by 5 to 10 orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 4 algorithms, 1 table</p></details> |

Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors, allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more accurate posterior estimates.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>For G...</summary><p>For Github code see https://github.com/vdlad/Remarkable-Robustness-of-LLMs. Send all correspondence to the first author</p></details> |

The dielectric behaviour of oils, governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the sensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant sensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.41% with the random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil identification. The system's compact form factor, efficiency, and high performance underscore its viability for fast and reliable oil characterization in industrial environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 11 figures, Accepted to IEEE INDISCON 2025</p></details> |

Character sets change over time, and character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions, often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting generalization and performance.

Our method leverages low-level complexity and structural information from reference and test videos to predict perceptual quality scores. Specifically, we extract spatio-temporal features using Video Complexity Analyzer (VCA) and compute SSIM values from the test video to capture both texture and structural characteristics. These features are aggregated through temporal pooling, and residual features are calculated by comparing the original and distorted feature sets. The combined features are used to train an XGBoost regression model that estimates the overall video quality. The pipeline is fully automated, interpretable, and highly scalable, requiring no deep neural networks or GPU inference. Experimental results on the challenge dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive correlation with subjective quality scores while maintaining a low computational footprint. The model's lightweight design and strong generalization performance suit real-time streaming quality monitoring and adaptive encoding scenarios.</p></details> | ICME 2025 |

In this study, we propose incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE model as additional supervision signals.

However, recent work has shown that applying KE can adversely affect models' broader factual recall accuracy and diminish their reasoning abilities. Although these studies give insights into the potential harms of KE algorithms, e.g., performance evaluations on benchmarks, little is understood about why such destructive failures occur. Motivated by this, we define a novel synthetic task in which a Transformer is trained from scratch to internalize a "structured" knowledge graph. The structure enforces relationships between entities of the graph, such that editing a factual association has "trickling effects" on other entities (e.g., altering X's parent is Y to Z affects who X's siblings' parent is). Through evaluations of edited models on this task, we show that KE inadvertently affects representations of entities beyond the targeted one, distorting relevant structures that allow a model to infer unseen knowledge about an entity. We call this phenomenon representation shattering and demonstrate that it degrades models' factual recall and reasoning performance. We further corroborate our findings in naturalistic settings with pre-trained Llama and Mamba models as well. Overall, our work yields a precise mechanistic hypothesis to explain why KE has adverse effects on model abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accurate and efficient zero-shot 6D pose estimation with frozen foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09784v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable 8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Q-SAM2: Accurate Quantization for Segment Anything Model 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09782v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization. We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training, our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over non-calibrated models.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Despite their critical role, LLM inference engines are prone to bugs due to the immense resource demands of LLMs and the complexities of cross-platform compatibility. However, a systematic understanding of these bugs remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we present the first empirical study on bugs in LLM inference engines. We mine official repositories of 5 widely adopted LLM inference engines, constructing a comprehensive dataset of 929 real-world bugs. Through a rigorous open coding process, we analyze these bugs to uncover their symptoms, root causes, and commonality. Our findings reveal six major bug symptoms and a taxonomy of 28 root causes, shedding light on the key challenges in bug detection and location within LLM inference engines. Based on these insights, we propose a series of actionable implications for researchers, inference engine vendors, and LLM app developers.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Share Secrets for Privacy: Confidential Forecasting with Vertical Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20761v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a promising area for time series forecasting in many applications, such as healthcare and manufacturing. Critical challenges to address include data privacy and over-fitting on small and noisy datasets during both training and inference. Additionally, such forecasting models must scale well with the number of parties while ensuring strong convergence and low-tuning complexity. We address these challenges and propose ``Secret-shared Time Series Forecasting with VFL'' (STV), a novel framework with the following key features: i) a privacy-preserving algorithm for forecasting with SARIMAX and autoregressive trees on vertically-partitioned data; ii) decentralised forecasting using secret sharing and multi-party computation; and iii) novel N-party algorithms for matrix multiplication and inverse operations for exact parameter optimization, giving strong convergence with minimal tuning complexity. We evaluate on six representative datasets from public and industry-specific contexts. Results demonstrate that STV's forecasting accuracy is comparable to those of centralized approaches. Our exact optimization outperforms centralized methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion models and long-short-term memory, by 23.81% on forecasting accuracy. We also evaluate scalability by examining the communication costs of exact and iterative optimization to navigate the choice between the two. STV's code and supplementary material is available online: https://github.com/adis98/STV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 20th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Geometric flow regularization in latent spaces for smooth dynamics with the efficient variations of curvature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09679v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We design strategies in nonlinear geometric analysis to temper the effects of adversarial learning for sufficiently smooth data of numerical method-type dynamics in encoder-decoder methods, variational and deterministic, through the use of geometric flow regularization. We augment latent spaces with geometric flows to control structure. Our techniques rely on adaptations of curvature and Ricci flow. We invent new geometric flows or discover them neurally and non-parametrically. All of our flows are solved using physics-informed learning. Traditional geometric meaning is traded for computing ability, but we maintain key geometric invariants, the primary of which are maintained, intrinsically-low structure, canonicity or a lack of irregularity, nontriviality due to sufficient lower bounds on curvature, and distortion of volume element, that develop quality in the inference stage. Our primary contributions are fourfold. We develop a loss based on Gaussian curvature using closed path circulation integration for surfaces, bypassing automatic differentiation of the Christoffel symbols through use of Stokes' theorem. We invent a new parametric flow derived from a linear version of the Gauss equation and a Riemannian decomposition for a custom tensor defined with a normal Hessian and Weyl tensor proxies. We develop two strategies based on time differentiation of functionals, one with a special case of scalar curvature for conformally-changed metrics, and another with harmonic maps, their energy, and induced metrics. Our methods, while diminished analytically, maintain overall integral latent structure. We showcase that curvature flows and the formulation of geometric structure in intermediary encoded settings enhance learning and overall zero-shot and adversarial fidelity.</p></details> | First version |
| **[Query-Level Uncertainty in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09669v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism, which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.</p></details> | In Progress |

To address this, we introduce MAGIC-VQA, a novel framework that enhances VQA by systematically integrating commonsense knowledge with LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA employs a three-stage process: (1) Explicit Knowledge Integration from external sources, (2) By-Type Post-Processing for contextual refinement, and (3) Implicit Knowledge Augmentation using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for structured reasoning. While GNNs bring greater depth to structured inference, they enable superior relational inference beyond LVLMs. MAGIC-VQA bridges a key gap by unifying commonsensse knowledge with LVLM-driven reasoning, eliminating the need for extensive pre-training or complex prompt tuning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, significantly improving commonsense reasoning in VQA.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2025 |

(2) YOCO employs a hybrid ReRAM-SRAM memory structure to balance computational efficiency and storage density. (3) YOCO tailors an IMC-friendly attention computing flow with an efficient pipeline to accelerate the inference of transformer-based AI models.

Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, Accepted by ACL 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Identifiable Latent Bandits: Leveraging observational data for personalized decision-making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16239v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For many decision-making tasks, such as precision medicine, historical data alone are insufficient to determine the right choice for a new problem instance or patient. Online algorithms like multi-armed bandits can find optimal personalized decisions but are notoriously sample-hungry. In practice, training a bandit for a new individual from scratch is often infeasible, as the number of trials required is larger than the practical number of decision points. Latent bandits offer rapid exploration and personalization beyond what context variables can reveal, provided that a latent variable model can be learned consistently. In this work, we propose an identifiable latent bandit framework that leads to optimal decision-making with a shorter exploration time than classical bandits by learning from historical records of decisions and outcomes. Our method is based on nonlinear independent component analysis that provably identifies representations from observational data sufficient to infer the optimal action in new bandit instances. We verify this strategy in simulated and semi-synthetic environments, showing substantial improvement over online and offline learning baselines when identifying conditions are satisfied.</p></details> | 30 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Causality-Inspired Fair Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17373v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multimodal recommendations (MMR) have gained increasing attention for alleviating the data sparsity problem of traditional recommender systems by incorporating modality-based representations. Although MMR exhibits notable improvement in recommendation accuracy, we empirically validate that an increase in the quantity or variety of modalities leads to a higher degree of users' sensitive information leakage due to entangled causal relationships, risking fair representation learning. On the other hand, existing fair representation learning approaches are mostly based on the assumption that sensitive information is solely leaked from users' interaction data and do not explicitly model the causal relationships introduced by multimodal data, which limits their applicability in multimodal scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel fair multimodal recommendation approach (dubbed FMMRec) through causality-inspired fairness-oriented modal disentanglement and relation-aware fairness learning. Particularly, we disentangle biased and filtered modal embeddings inspired by causal inference techniques, enabling the mining of modality-based unfair and fair user-user relations, thereby enhancing the fairness and informativeness of user representations. By addressing the causal effects of sensitive attributes on user preferences, our approach aims to achieve counterfactual fairness in multimodal recommendations. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FMMRec relative to the state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[On the Privacy Risks of Spiking Neural Networks: A Membership Inference Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13191v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Our code is available at https://github.com/sharmaabhijith/MIA_SNN.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/bscho333/ReVisiT</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Powered CPI Prediction Inference with Online Text Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09516v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency, survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.</p></details> | 73 pages, 13 figures |

To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.</p></details> | <details><summary>IMPOR...</summary><p>IMPORTANT: This preprint is not the final version.

We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

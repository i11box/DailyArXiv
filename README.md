| **[Amplitude amplification and estimation require inverses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23787v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive, quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings, $U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$ can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Gaussian Variation Field Diffusion for High-fidelity Video-to-4D Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23785v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel framework for video-to-4D generation that creates high-quality dynamic 3D content from single video inputs. Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

| **[SUB: Benchmarking CBM Generalization via Synthetic Attribute Substitutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23784v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and other concept-based interpretable models show great promise for making AI applications more transparent, which is essential in fields like medicine. Despite their success, we demonstrate that CBMs struggle to reliably identify the correct concepts under distribution shifts. To assess the robustness of CBMs to concept variations, we introduce SUB: a fine-grained image and concept benchmark containing 38,400 synthetic images based on the CUB dataset. To create SUB, we select a CUB subset of 33 bird classes and 45 concepts to generate images which substitute a specific concept, such as wing color or belly pattern. We introduce a novel Tied Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method to precisely control generated images, where noise sharing for two parallel denoising processes ensures that both the correct bird class and the correct attribute are generated. This novel benchmark enables rigorous evaluation of CBMs and similar interpretable models, contributing to the development of more robust methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/sub and the dataset at http://huggingface.co/datasets/Jessica-bader/SUB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cascaded Information Disclosure for Generalized Evaluation of Problem Solving Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23776v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While question-answering~(QA) benchmark performance is an automatic and scalable method to compare LLMs, it is an indirect method of evaluating their underlying problem-solving capabilities. Therefore, we propose a holistic and generalizable framework based on \emph{cascaded question disclosure} that provides a more accurate estimate of the models' problem-solving capabilities while maintaining the scalability and automation. This approach collects model responses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information about the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find that our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also induces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA paradigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and knowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families. Our approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation settings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation overestimates the differences in performance between models. We further validate our findings by extensive ablation studies.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Consensus-Driven Active Model Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23771v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Code and data are available at https://github.com/justinkay/coda.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Highlight. 16 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Scaled Beta Models and Feature Dilution for Dynamic Ticket Pricing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23767v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel approach is presented for identifying distinct signatures of performing acts in the secondary ticket resale market by analyzing dynamic pricing distributions. Using a newly curated, time series dataset from the SeatGeek API, we model ticket pricing distributions as scaled Beta distributions. This enables accurate parameter estimation from incomplete statistical data using a hybrid of quantile matching and the method of moments. Incorporating the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters into Random Forest classifiers significantly improves pairwise artist classification accuracy, demonstrating the unique economic signatures in event pricing data. Additionally, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that incorporating zero-variance (constant-value) features into Random Forest models acts as an implicit regularizer, enhancing feature variety and robustness. This regularization promotes deeper, more varied trees in the ensemble, improving the bias-variance tradeoff and mitigating overfitting to dominant features. These findings are validated on both the new ticket pricing dataset and the standard UCI ML handwritten digits dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving annotator selection in Active Learning using a mood and fatigue-aware Recommender System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23756v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study centers on overcoming the challenge of selecting the best annotators for each query in Active Learning (AL), with the objective of minimizing misclassifications. AL recognizes the challenges related to cost and time when acquiring labeled data, and decreases the number of labeled data needed. Nevertheless, there is still the necessity to reduce annotation errors, aiming to be as efficient as possible, to achieve the expected accuracy faster. Most strategies for query-annotator pairs do not consider internal factors that affect productivity, such as mood, attention, motivation, and fatigue levels. This work addresses this gap in the existing literature, by not only considering how the internal factors influence annotators (mood and fatigue levels) but also presenting a new query-annotator pair strategy, using a Knowledge-Based Recommendation System (RS). The RS ranks the available annotators, allowing to choose one or more to label the queried instance using their past accuracy values, and their mood and fatigue levels, as well as information about the instance queried. This work bases itself on existing literature on mood and fatigue influence on human performance, simulating annotators in a realistic manner, and predicting their performance with the RS. The results show that considering past accuracy values, as well as mood and fatigue levels reduces the number of annotation errors made by the annotators, and the uncertainty of the model through its training, when compared to not using internal factors. Accuracy and F1-score values were also better in the proposed approach, despite not being as substantial as the aforementioned. The methodologies and findings presented in this study begin to explore the open challenge of human cognitive factors affecting AL.</p></details> | Master's thesis |
| **[Vector-Quantized Vision Foundation Models for Object-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20263v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving visual scenes as objects and background--like humans do--Object-Centric Learning (OCL) aggregates image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, termed \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision of reconstructing the input from these aggregated slots struggles with complex object textures, thus Vision Foundation Model (VFM) representations are used as the aggregation input and reconstruction target. However, existing methods leverage VFM representations in diverse ways and often fail to fully exploit their potential. In response, we propose a clean architecture--Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO)--that unifies mainstream OCL methods. The key to our unification is simple yet effective, just shared quantizing the same VFM representation as the reconstruction target. Through mathematical modeling and statistical verification, we further analyze why VFM representations facilitate OCL aggregation and how their shared quantization as reconstruction targets strengthens OCL supervision. Experiments show that across different VFMs, aggregators and decoders, our VVO consistently outperforms baselines in object discovery and recognition, as well as downstream visual prediction and reasoning. The implementation and model checkpoints are available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Is SHACL Suitable for Data Quality Assessment?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22305v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs have been widely adopted in both enterprises, such as the Google Knowledge Graph, and open platforms like Wikidata, to represent domain knowledge and support artificial intelligence applications. They model real-world information as nodes and edges. To embrace flexibility, knowledge graphs often lack enforced schemas (i.e., ontologies), leading to potential data quality issues, such as semantically overlapping nodes. Yet ensuring their quality is essential, as issues in the data can affect applications relying on them. To assess the quality of knowledge graphs, existing works propose either high-level frameworks comprising various data quality dimensions without concrete implementations, define tools that measure data quality with ad-hoc SPARQL queries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the graph. Although the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment, none of them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions. In this paper, we explore this gap by investigating the extent to which SHACL can be used to assess data quality in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we defined SHACL shapes for 69 data quality metrics proposed by Zaveri et al. [1] and implemented a prototype that automatically instantiates these shapes and computes the corresponding data quality measures from their validation results. All resources are provided for repeatability.</p></details> | 43 pages |
| **[How AI Ideas Affect the Creativity, Diversity, and Evolution of Human Ideas: Evidence From a Large, Dynamic Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13481v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure to large language model output is rapidly increasing. How will seeing AI-generated ideas affect human ideas? We conducted an experiment (800+ participants, 40+ countries) where participants viewed creative ideas that were from ChatGPT or prior experimental participants and then brainstormed their own idea. We varied the number of AI-generated examples (none, low, or high exposure) and if the examples were labeled as 'AI' (disclosure). Our dynamic experiment design -- ideas from prior participants in an experimental condition are used as stimuli for future participants in the same experimental condition -- speaks to the interdependent process of cultural creation: creative ideas are built upon prior ideas. Hence, we capture the compounding effects of having LLMs 'in the culture loop'. We find that high AI exposure (but not low AI exposure) did not affect the creativity of individual ideas but did increase the average amount and rate of change of collective idea diversity. AI made ideas different, not better. There were no main effects of disclosure. We also found that self-reported creative people were less influenced by knowing an idea was from AI and that participants may knowingly adopt AI ideas when the task is difficult. Our findings suggest that introducing AI ideas may increase collective diversity but not individual creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM Collective Intelligence 2025.

| **[DICOM De-Identification via Hybrid AI and Rule-Based Framework for Scalable, Uncertainty-Aware Redaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23736v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data. Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text, extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage residual risks. This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical, and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures, |
| **[RAGNet: Large-scale Reasoning-based Affordance Segmentation Benchmark towards General Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23734v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General robotic grasping systems require accurate object affordance perception in diverse open-world scenarios following human instructions. However, current studies suffer from the problem of lacking reasoning-based large-scale affordance prediction data, leading to considerable concern about open-world effectiveness. To address this limitation, we build a large-scale grasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like instructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k reasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as wild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully annotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions is largely increased by removing their category name and only providing functional descriptions. Furthermore, we propose a comprehensive affordance-based grasping framework, named AffordanceNet, which consists of a VLM pre-trained on our massive affordance data and a grasping network that conditions an affordance map to grasp the target. Extensive experiments on affordance segmentation benchmarks and real-robot manipulation tasks show that our model has a powerful open-world generalization ability.

| **[Coordinating Search-Informed Reasoning and Reasoning-Guided Search in Claim Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07528v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence, while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly advancing multi-hop claim verification.</p></details> | Work in progress |

TAAC employs a Centralized Training/Centralized Execution scheme incorporating multi-headed attention mechanisms in both the actor and critic. This design facilitates dynamic, inter-agent communication, allowing agents to explicitly query teammates, thereby efficiently managing the exponential growth of joint-action spaces while ensuring a high degree of collaboration. We further introduce a penalized loss function which promotes diverse yet complementary roles among agents. We evaluate TAAC in a simulated soccer environment against benchmark algorithms representing other multi-agent paradigms, including Proximal Policy Optimization and Multi-Agent Actor-Attention-Critic. We find that TAAC exhibits superior performance and enhanced collaborative behaviors across a variety of metrics (win rates, goal differentials, Elo ratings, inter-agent connectivity, balanced spatial distributions, and frequent tactical interactions such as ball possession swaps).</p></details> | 8 pages |

While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025 Workshop on Long Context Foundation Models (ICFM).

| **[DiffuMatch: Category-Agnostic Spectral Diffusion Priors for Robust Non-rigid Shape Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23715v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving non-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine the power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven learning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods in this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and still rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for functional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the accuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios where assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the first time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can be replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative model of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative modeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit the resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth functional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the learned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used strategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of functional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation strategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate that our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic approaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

| **[Generalizable Image Repair for Robust Visual Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05911v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based control relies on accurate perception to achieve robustness. However, image distribution changes caused by sensor noise, adverse weather, and dynamic lighting can degrade perception, leading to suboptimal control decisions. Existing approaches, including domain adaptation and adversarial training, improve robustness but struggle to generalize to unseen corruptions while introducing computational overhead. To address this challenge, we propose a real-time image repair module that restores corrupted images before they are used by the controller. Our method leverages generative adversarial models, specifically CycleGAN and pix2pix, for image repair. CycleGAN enables unpaired image-to-image translation to adapt to novel corruptions, while pix2pix exploits paired image data when available to improve the quality. To ensure alignment with control performance, we introduce a control-focused loss function that prioritizes perceptual consistency in repaired images. We evaluated our method in a simulated autonomous racing environment with various visual corruptions. The results show that our approach significantly improves performance compared to baselines, mitigating distribution shift and enhancing controller reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[GCL-GCN: Graphormer and Contrastive Learning Enhanced Attributed Graph Clustering Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19095v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model, GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%, respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/GCL-GCN</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Velocity Field Modeling for Gaussian Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23704v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-fidelity 3D video reconstruction is essential for enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with realistic motion in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has achieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great representation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with complex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often overfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual quality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for static scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic content. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity field modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed FlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering (VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a flow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and size of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on multi-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple real-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not only notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry artifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian trajectories.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Winding Clearness for Differentiable Point Cloud Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13639v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose to explore the properties of raw point clouds through the \emph{winding clearness}, a concept we first introduce for measuring the clarity of the interior/exterior relationships represented by the winding number field of the point cloud. In geometric modeling, the winding number is a powerful tool for distinguishing the interior and exterior of a given surface $\partial \Omega$, and it has been previously used for point normal orientation and surface reconstruction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to evaluate and optimize the quality of point clouds based on the winding clearness. We observe that point clouds with less noise generally exhibit better winding clearness. Accordingly, we propose an objective function that quantifies the error in winding clearness, solely utilizing the coordinates of the point clouds. Moreover, we demonstrate that the winding clearness error is differentiable and can serve as a loss function in point cloud processing. We present this observation from two aspects: 1) We update the coordinates of the points by back-propagating the loss function for individual point clouds, resulting in an overall improvement without involving a neural network. 2) We incorporate winding clearness as a geometric constraint in the diffusion-based 3D generative model and update the network parameters to generate point clouds with less noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of optimizing the winding clearness in enhancing the point cloud quality. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance in handling noisy point clouds with thin structures, highlighting the benefits of the global perspective enabled by the winding number.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computer-Aided Design through SPM 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we present SAM(a Stability-Aware Manager), an autonomic cache manager that establishes decision stability as a first-class design principle. It achieves this through its core control policy, AURA(Autonomic Utility-balancing Resource Allocator), which resolves the classic exploitation-exploration dilemma by synthesizing two orthogonal factors: the H-factor, representing proven historical efficiency (exploitation), and the V-factor, for estimated marginal gain (exploration). Through this practical synthesis and adaptive control, SAM achieves sustained high performance with strategic stability and robustness in volatile conditions. Extensive experiments against 14 diverse baselines demonstrate SAM's superiority. It achieves top-tier throughput while being uniquely resilient to complex workload shifts and adversarial workloads like cache pollution. Furthermore, its decision latency is highly scalable, remaining nearly constant as the system grows to 120 databases. Crucially, SAM achieves superior decision stability -- maintaining consistent optimization directions despite noise, avoiding performance oscillations while ensuring predictable Quality of Service. These results prove that a principled, stability-aware design is essential for sustained high performance in real-world, large-scale systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures.

Our findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action. This integration is precisely consistent with the architecture that we formalize, providing a solid platform for next-generation geosimulation systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 1 table |

Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

Recent work has begun to explore the incorporation of latent actions, an abstract representation of visual change between two frames, into VLA pre-training. In this paper, we introduce villa-X, a novel Visual-Language-Latent-Action (ViLLA) framework that advances latent action modeling for learning generalizable robot manipulation policies. Our approach improves both how latent actions are learned and how they are incorporated into VLA pre-training. Together, these contributions enable villa-X to achieve superior performance across simulated environments including SIMPLER and LIBERO, as well as on two real-world robot setups including gripper and dexterous hand manipulation. We believe the ViLLA paradigm holds significant promise, and that our villa-X provides a strong foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/villa-x</p></details> |
| **[SDFit: 3D Object Pose and Shape by Fitting a Morphable SDF to a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16178v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering 3D object pose and shape from a single image is a challenging and ill-posed problem. This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities, the vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and the lack of 3D ground truth for natural images. Existing deep-network methods are trained on synthetic datasets to predict 3D shapes, so they often struggle generalizing to real-world images. Moreover, they lack an explicit feedback loop for refining noisy estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without directly considering pixel alignment. To tackle these limitations, we develop a novel render-and-compare optimization framework, called SDFit. This has three key innovations: First, it uses a learned category-specific and morphable signed-distance-function (mSDF) model, and fits this to an image by iteratively refining both 3D pose and shape. The mSDF robustifies inference by constraining the search on the manifold of valid shapes, while allowing for arbitrary shape topologies. Second, SDFit retrieves an initial 3D shape that likely matches the image, by exploiting foundational models for efficient look-up into 3D shape databases. Third, SDFit initializes pose by establishing rich 2D-3D correspondences between the image and the mSDF through foundational features. We evaluate SDFit on three image datasets, i.e., Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC. SDFit performs on par with SotA feed-forward networks for unoccluded images and common poses, but is uniquely robust to occlusions and uncommon poses. Moreover, it requires no retraining for unseen images. Thus, SDFit contributes new insights for generalizing in the wild. Code is available at https://anticdimi.github.io/sdfit.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV'...</summary><p>ICCV'25 Camera Ready; 12 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[An Inversion-based Measure of Memorization for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05846v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have witnessed substantial advances in image generation powered by diffusion models. However, it was shown that diffusion models are susceptible to training data memorization, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and privacy invasion. This study delves into a rigorous analysis of memorization in diffusion models. We introduce InvMM, an inversion-based measure of memorization, which is based on inverting a sensitive latent noise distribution accounting for the replication of an image. For accurate estimation of the measure, we propose an adaptive algorithm that balances the normality and sensitivity of the noise distribution. Comprehensive experiments across four datasets, conducted on both unconditional and text-guided diffusion models, demonstrate that InvMM provides a reliable and complete quantification of memorization. Notably, InvMM is commensurable between samples, reveals the true extent of memorization from an adversarial standpoint and implies how memorization differs from membership. In practice, it serves as an auditing tool for developers to reliably assess the risk of memorization, thereby contributing to the enhancement of trustworthiness and privacy-preserving capabilities of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

| **[Amplitude amplification and estimation require inverses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23787v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove that the generic quantum speedups for brute-force search and counting only hold when the process we apply them to can be efficiently inverted. The algorithms speeding up these problems, amplitude amplification and amplitude estimation, assume the ability to apply a state preparation unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$; we give problem instances based on trace estimation where no algorithm which uses only $U$ beats the naive, quadratically slower approach. Our proof of this is simple and goes through the compressed oracle method introduced by Zhandry. Since these two subroutines are responsible for the ubiquity of the quadratic "Grover" speedup in quantum algorithms, our result explains why such speedups are far harder to come by in the settings of quantum learning, metrology, and sensing. In these settings, $U$ models the evolution of an experimental system, so implementing $U^\dagger$ can be much harder -- tantamount to reversing time within the system. Our result suggests a dichotomy: without inverse access, quantum speedups are scarce; with it, quantum speedups abound.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Direct 4D diffusion modeling is extremely challenging due to costly data construction and the high-dimensional nature of jointly representing 3D shape, appearance, and motion. We address these challenges by introducing a Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE that directly encodes canonical Gaussian Splats (GS) and their temporal variations from 3D animation data without per-instance fitting, and compresses high-dimensional animations into a compact latent space. Building upon this efficient representation, we train a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with temporal-aware Diffusion Transformer conditioned on input videos and canonical GS. Trained on carefully-curated animatable 3D objects from the Objaverse dataset, our model demonstrates superior generation quality compared to existing methods. It also exhibits remarkable generalization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on synthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.

| **[Generalizable Motion Policies through Keypoint Parameterization and Transportation Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13458v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Interactive Demonstrations has revolutionized the way non-expert humans teach robots. It is enough to kinesthetically move the robot around to teach pick-and-place, dressing, or cleaning policies. However, the main challenge is correctly generalizing to novel situations, e.g., different surfaces to clean or different arm postures to dress. This article proposes a novel task parameterization and generalization to transport the original robot policy, i.e., position, velocity, orientation, and stiffness. Unlike the state of the art, only a set of keypoints is tracked during the demonstration and the execution, e.g., a point cloud of the surface to clean. We then propose to fit a nonlinear transformation that would deform the space and then the original policy using the paired source and target point sets. The use of function approximators like Gaussian Processes allows us to generalize, or transport, the policy from every space location while estimating the uncertainty of the resulting policy due to the limited task keypoints and the reduced number of demonstrations. We compare the algorithm's performance with state-of-the-art task parameterization alternatives and analyze the effect of different function approximators. We also validated the algorithm on robot manipulation tasks, i.e., different posture arm dressing, different location product reshelving, and different shape surface cleaning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was accepted at IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO)</p></details> |

Specifically, a trace is generated by sampling each vertex with probability $p_v$, then taking the resulting induced subgraph on the sampled vertices, and then adding noise in the form of either (a) deleting each edge in the subgraph with probability $1-p_e$, or (b) deleting each edge with probability $f_e$ and transforming a non-edge into an edge with probability $f_e$. We show that, under mild assumptions on $p_v$, $p_e$ and $f_e$, if $G$ is selected uniformly at random, then $O(p_e^{-1} p_v^{-2} \log n)$ or $O((f_e-1/2)^{-2} p_v^{-2} \log n)$ traces suffice to reconstruct $G$ with high probability. In contrast, if $G$ is arbitrary, then $\exp(\Omega(n))$ traces are necessary even when $p_v=1, p_e=1/2$.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, to appear in ISIT 2024</p></details> |

However, their deployment in high-stakes domains has exposed vulnerabilities that can result in significant societal harm. To systematically study and mitigate these risk, initiatives like the AI Incident Database (AIID) have emerged, cataloging over 3,000 real-world AI failure reports. Currently, associating a new report with the appropriate AI Incident relies on manual expert intervention, limiting scalability and delaying the identification of emerging failure patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval-based framework that automates the association of new reports with existing AI Incidents through semantic similarity modeling. We formalize the task as a ranking problem, where each report-comprising a title and a full textual description-is compared to previously documented AI Incidents based on embedding cosine similarity. Benchmarking traditional lexical methods, cross-encoder architectures, and transformer-based sentence embedding models, we find that the latter consistently achieve superior performance. Our analysis further shows that combining titles and descriptions yields substantial improvements in ranking accuracy compared to using titles alone. Moreover, retrieval performance remains stable across variations in description length, highlighting the robustness of the framework. Finally, we find that retrieval performance consistently improves as the training set expands. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient solution for supporting the maintenance of the AIID.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |

In this research, we address two problems: 1) to detect hate speech in Arabic text, 2) to clean a given text from hate speech. The meaning of cleaning here is replacing each bad word with stars based on the number of letters for each word. Regarding the first problem, we conduct several experiments using deep learning models and transformers to determine the best model in terms of the F1 score. Regarding second problem, we consider it as a machine translation task, where the input is a sentence containing dirty text and the output is the same sentence with masking the dirty text. The presented methods achieve the best model in hate speech detection with a 92\% Macro F1 score and 95\% accuracy. Regarding the text cleaning experiment, the best result in the hate speech masking model reached 0.3 in BLEU score with 1-gram, which is a good result compared with the state of the art machine translation systems.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

This article explores the multifaceted roles of AI in the architectural process, emphasizing its potential to enhance creativity and efficiency while addressing its limitations in capturing multisensory and experiential dimensions of space. Historically, architectural innovation has paralleled technological progress, from basic tools to advanced computer-aided design systems. However, the integration of AI presents unique challenges, requiring architects to critically evaluate its role in design. A narrative review methodology was adopted, focusing on academic sources selected for their relevance, recency, and credibility. The findings reveal that AI is increasingly integrated across various stages of the architectural process, from early conceptualization and site analysis to generative design and construction detailing. AI tools excel at automating repetitive tasks and generating innovative design solutions, freeing architects to focus on creativity and problem-solving. Additionally, AI's (text- toimage) visual representation strength challenges the ocularcentric approaches in architecture, which should push future architects to address the holistic sensory and experiential qualities of space or the critical thinking inherent to architectural design. While AI offers transformative potential, architects must view it as a collaborative partner rather than a passive tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures.

Although the current state of the art (SOTA) achieves high accuracy in both tasks, it struggles with small objects. To overcome this, we propose the Efficient Masked Attention Transformer (EMAT), which improves classification and segmentation accuracy, especially for small objects. EMAT introduces three modifications: a novel memory-efficient masked attention mechanism, a learnable downscaling strategy, and parameter-efficiency enhancements. EMAT outperforms all FS-CS methods on the PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, using at least four times fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, as the current FS-CS evaluation setting discards available annotations, despite their costly collection, we introduce two novel evaluation settings that consider these annotations to better reflect practical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for GCPR 2025.

Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, by incorporating CS techniques into the SHRED architecture, our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$ regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions. We validate CS-SHRED on challenging problems including viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the traditional SHRED approach, CS-SHRED achieves significantly higher reconstruction fidelity -- as demonstrated by improved SSIM and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased robustness against noise and outliers. Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the spatiotemporal data recovery establishes CS-SHRED as a promising tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and scientific data analyses.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables.

While consistency has primarily been viewed as a binary property, i.e., a graph is consistent or inconsistent with respect to a set of constraints, recent work has presented an approach to consistency as a graduated property. This allows living with inconsistencies for a while and repairing them when necessary. For repairing inconsistencies in a graph, we use graph transformation rules with so-called {\em impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions} to understand how much repair gain certain rule applications would bring. Both types of conditions can be derived from given graph constraints. Our main theorem shows that the difference between the number of actual constraint violations before and after a graph transformation step can be characterized by the difference between the numbers of violated impairment-indicating and repair-indicating application conditions. This theory forms the basis for algorithms with look-ahead that rank graph transformations according to their potential for graph repair. An evaluation shows that graph repair can be well supported by rules with these new types of application conditions in terms of effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 25 Figures, new, more efficient method for constructing application conditions, theoretical comparison to other concepts of consistency, extended evaluation</p></details> |

Often it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many Indian languages share the same script, making the task even more challenging. Taking all these challenges into account, we develop and release a dataset of 250K sentences consisting of 23 languages including English and all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers, where data in most languages are newly created.

OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance - what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the specific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks. Furthermore, CoA-VLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities, including recognizing unseen object poses, identifying free space, and avoiding obstacles in novel environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://chain-of-affordance.github.io</p></details> |

To address these shortcomings, we introduce Jelly, a fast and convenient binary serialization format for RDF data that supports both batch and streaming use cases. Jelly is designed to maximize serialization throughput, reduce file size with lightweight streaming compression, and minimize compute resource usage. Built on Protocol Buffers, Jelly is easy to integrate with modern programming languages and RDF libraries. To maximize reusability, Jelly has an open protocol specification, open-source implementations in Java and Python integrated with popular RDF libraries, and a versatile command-line tool. To illustrate its usefulness, we outline concrete use cases where Jelly can provide tangible benefits. We consider that by combining practical usability with state-of-the-art efficiency, Jelly is an important contribution to the Semantic Web tool stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developers Workshop, co-located with SEMANTiCS'25: International Conference on Semantic Systems, September 3-5, 2025, Vienna, Austria</p></details> |

Accurately assessing user experience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this adaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as sentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these individually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging multimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a Transformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for estimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our approach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a multi-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal dynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems 2025 (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

This framework is a simple extension of the CAD paradigm, since it describes arc of curves in terms of control polygons and weights, which are extended to complex values. One of the major advantages of this extension is that we may make use of two different groups of projective transformations. Besides the group of projective transformations of the real plane, we have the group of complex projective transformations. This allows us to apply useful transformations like the geometric inversion to curves in design. In addition to this, the use of the complex formulation allows to lower the degree of the curves in some cases. This can be checked using the resultant of two polynomials and provides a simple formula for determining whether a rational cubic curve is a conic or not. Examples of application of the formalism to classical curves are included.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV25 |

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In this paper, we propose a driving World Model named EOT-WM, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos for driving simulation. Specifically, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories in the BEV space with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. We first project ego-other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate for vehicle-trajectory match via pixel positions. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Classical approaches largely rely on extrapolative methods, such as the Lee-Carter (LC) model, which use mortality rates as the mortality measure. In recent years, compositional data analysis (CoDA), which respects summability and non-negativity constraints, has gained increasing attention for mortality forecasting. While the centred log-ratio (CLR) transformation is commonly used to map compositional data to real space, the {\alpha}-transformation, a generalisation of log-ratio transformations, offers greater flexibility and adaptability. This study contributes to mortality forecasting by introducing the {\alpha}-transformation as an alternative to the CLR transformation within a non-functional CoDA model that has not been previously investigated in existing literature. To fairly compare the impact of transformation choices on forecast accuracy, zero values in the data are imputed, although the {\alpha}-transformation can inherently handle them. Using age-specific life table death counts for males and females in 31 selected European countries/regions from 1983 to 2018, the proposed method demonstrates comparable performance to the CLR transformation in most cases, with improved forecast accuracy in some instances. These findings highlight the potential of the {\alpha}-transformation for enhancing mortality forecasting within the non-functional CoDA framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have shown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free compression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision and language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in LVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer pruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find that non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps pose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights, we propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL tokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only achieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also exhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and highly compatible.

This study fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1) Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2) Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets, ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models. Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Current visual explanation techniques, such as gradient-based or class-activation-based methods, often exhibit a strong dependence on specific model architectures. Conversely, perturbation-based methods, despite being model-agnostic, are computationally expensive as they require evaluating models on a large number of forward passes. In this work, we introduce Foveation-based Explanations (FovEx), a novel XAI method inspired by human vision. FovEx seamlessly integrates biologically inspired perturbations by iteratively creating foveated renderings of the image and combines them with gradient-based visual explorations to determine locations of interest efficiently. These locations are selected to maximize the performance of the model to be explained with respect to the downstream task and then combined to generate an attribution map. We provide a thorough evaluation with qualitative and quantitative assessments on established benchmarks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both transformers (on 4 out of 5 metrics) and convolutional models (on 3 out of 5 metrics), demonstrating its versatility among various architectures. Furthermore, we show the alignment between the explanation map produced by FovEx and human gaze patterns (+14\% in NSS compared to RISE, +203\% in NSS compared to GradCAM). This comparison enhances our confidence in FovEx's ability to close the interpretation gap between humans and machines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the International Journal of Computer Vision (Springer Nature)</p></details> |

While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

Current technologies face two significant challenges: first, the traffic sign dataset exhibits a pronounced long-tail distribution, resulting in a substantial decline in recognition performance of traditional convolutional networks when processing low-frequency and out-of-distribution classes; second, traffic signs in real-world scenarios are predominantly small targets with significant scale variations, making it difficult to extract multi-scale features.To overcome these issues, we propose a novel two-stage framework combining open-vocabulary detection and cross-modal learning. For traffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable vision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to specifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For traffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal Contrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a Vision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL learns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating class confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method achieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for all-class recognition. The model also obtains 91.8% accuracy and 88.9% recall, significantly outperforming mainstream algorithms and demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization in complex, open-world scenarios.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures |
| **[Transformed Low-rank Adaptation via Tensor Decomposition and Its Applications to Text-to-image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08727v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of text-to-image models has become an increasingly popular technique with many applications. Among the various PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have gained significant attention due to their effectiveness, enabling users to fine-tune models with limited computational resources. However, the approximation gap between the low-rank assumption and desired fine-tuning weights prevents the simultaneous acquisition of ultra-parameter-efficiency and better performance. To reduce this gap and further improve the power of LoRA, we propose a new PEFT method that combines two classes of adaptations, namely, transform and residual adaptations. In specific, we first apply a full-rank and dense transform to the pre-trained weight. This learnable transform is expected to align the pre-trained weight as closely as possible to the desired weight, thereby reducing the rank of the residual weight. Then, the residual part can be effectively approximated by more compact and parameter-efficient structures, with a smaller approximation error. To achieve ultra-parameter-efficiency in practice, we design highly flexible and effective tensor decompositions for both the transform and residual adaptations. Additionally, popular PEFT methods such as DoRA can be summarized under this transform plus residual adaptation scheme. Experiments are conducted on fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models in subject-driven and controllable generation. The results manifest that our method can achieve better performances and parameter efficiency compared to LoRA and several baselines.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[MVCNet: Multi-View Contrastive Network for Motor Imagery Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17482v4)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable neural interaction by decoding brain activity for external communication. Motor imagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive mechanism. However, most existing models rely on single-stream architectures and overlook the multi-view nature of EEG signals, leading to limited performance and generalization. We propose a multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet), a dual-branch architecture that parallelly integrates CNN and Transformer blocks to capture both local spatial-temporal features and global temporal dependencies. To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet incorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view contrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views, and a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both branches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive and classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three scenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms nine state-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by integrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to the development of more reliable BCI systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

While indoor 3D VG has advanced, outdoor 3D VG remains underexplored due to two challenges: (1) large-scale outdoor LiDAR scenes are dominated by background points and contain limited foreground information, making cross-modal alignment and contextual understanding more difficult; and (2) most outdoor datasets lack spatial annotations for referential non-target objects, which hinders explicit learning of referential context. To this end, we propose LidaRefer, a context-aware 3D VG framework for outdoor scenes. LidaRefer incorporates an object-centric feature selection strategy to focus on semantically relevant visual features while reducing computational overhead. Then, its transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture excels at establishing fine-grained cross-modal alignment between refined visual features and word-level text features, and capturing comprehensive global context. Additionally, we present Discriminative-Supportive Collaborative localization (DiSCo), a novel supervision strategy that explicitly models spatial relationships between target, contextual, and ambiguous objects for accurate target identification. To enable this without manual labeling, we introduce a pseudo-labeling approach that retrieves 3D localization labels for referential non-target objects. LidaRefer achieves state-of-the-art performance on Talk2Car-3D dataset under various evaluation settings.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

This work analyzes the influence of hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation, regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed, while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

However, the fundamental question of how these models internally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains unexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are orthogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this distinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based text-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when generating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels in generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image regions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our findings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of content-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style requested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related regions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an emergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights contribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally represent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision. We share the code and dataset, together with an exploratory tool for visualizing attention maps at https://github.com/umilISLab/artistic-prompt-interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in: Applications of AI in the Analysis of Cultural and Artistic Heritage, organized within the 35th IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP) 2025</p></details> |

However, existing SSCOD methods based on Teacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error propagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures incur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise framework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically, ST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands high-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby fundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by transforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific knowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential for specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training. Experiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1\% labeled data, outperforming existing SSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM requires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or loss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient SSCOD.

Previous diffusion-based editing methods often attempt to handle all relevant subtasks in a single step, proving difficult when transformations become large or structurally complex. We address this by proposing a decoupled pipeline that separates object transformation, source region inpainting, and target region refinement. Both inpainting and refinement are implemented using a training-free diffusion approach, FreeFine. In experiments on our new GeoBench benchmark, which contains both 2D and 3D editing scenarios, FreeFine outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in image fidelity, and edit precision, especially under demanding transformations.

However, they often lack precise pixel-level spatial control, especially in scenarios involving partially corrupted objects where critical uncorrupted cues remain. To overcome this limitation, sketch-guided methods have been introduced, using either indirect gradient modulation or direct sketch injection to improve structural control. Yet, existing approaches typically establish a one-way mapping from the sketch to the masked regions only, neglecting the contextual information from unmasked object areas. This leads to a disconnection between the sketch and the uncorrupted content, thereby causing sketch-guided inconsistency and structural mismatch. To tackle this challenge, we propose a sketch-guided bidirectional feature interaction framework built upon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model. Our bidirectional interaction features two complementary directions, context-to-sketch and sketch-to-inpainting, that enable fine-grained spatial control for partially corrupted object inpainting. In the context-to-sketch direction, multi-scale latents from uncorrupted object regions are propagated to the sketch branch to generate a visual mask that adapts the sketch features to the visible context and denoising progress. In the sketch-to-inpainting direction, a sketch-conditional affine transformation modulates the influence of sketch guidance based on the learned visual mask, ensuring consistency with uncorrupted object content. This interaction is applied at multiple scales within the encoder of the diffusion U-Net, enabling the model to restore object structures with enhanced spatial fidelity. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages.

In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gynjn.github.io/iLRM/</p></details> |

This question of model selection is traditionally answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

In practice, these assumptions are unlikely to hold exactly. This paper considers the bias of selection-on-observables, instrumental variables, and proximal inference estimates under violations of their identifying assumptions. We develop bias expressions for IV and proximal inference that show how violations of their respective assumptions are amplified by any unmeasured confounding in the outcome variable. We propose a set of sensitivity tools that quantify the sensitivity of different identification strategies, and an augmented bias contour plot visualizes the relationship between these strategies. We argue that the act of choosing an identification strategy implicitly expresses a belief about the degree of violations that must be present in alternative identification strategies. Even when researchers intend to conduct an IV or proximal analysis, a sensitivity analysis comparing different identification strategies can help to better understand the implications of each set of assumptions. Throughout, we compare the different approaches on a re-analysis of the impact of state surveillance on the incidence of protest in Communist Poland.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figures, plus references and appendices</p></details> |
| **[DICOM De-Identification via Hybrid AI and Rule-Based Framework for Scalable, Uncertainty-Aware Redaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23736v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Access to medical imaging and associated text data has the potential to drive major advances in healthcare research and patient outcomes. However, the presence of Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files presents a significant barrier to the ethical and secure sharing of imaging datasets. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework developed by Impact Business Information Solutions (IBIS) that combines rule-based and AI-driven techniques, and rigorous uncertainty quantification for comprehensive PHI/PII removal from both metadata and pixel data. Our approach begins with a two-tiered rule-based system targeting explicit and inferred metadata elements, further augmented by a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and trained on a suite of synthetic datasets simulating realistic clinical PHI/PII. For pixel data, we employ an uncertainty-aware Faster R-CNN model to localize embedded text, extract candidate PHI via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and apply the NER pipeline for final redaction. Crucially, uncertainty quantification provides confidence measures for AI-based detections to enhance automation reliability and enable informed human-in-the-loop verification to manage residual risks. This uncertainty-aware deidentification framework achieves robust performance across benchmark datasets and regulatory standards, including DICOM, HIPAA, and TCIA compliance metrics. By combining scalable automation, uncertainty quantification, and rigorous quality assurance, our solution addresses critical challenges in medical data de-identification and supports the secure, ethical, and trustworthy release of imaging data for research.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures, |
| **[Inference for Dispersion and Curvature of Random Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09844v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many open questions pertaining to the statistical analysis of random objects, which are increasingly encountered. A major challenge is the absence of linear operations in such spaces. A basic statistical task is to quantify statistical dispersion or spread. For two measures of dispersion for data objects in geodesic metric spaces, Fr\'echet variance and metric variance, we derive a central limit theorem (CLT) for their joint distribution. This analysis reveals that the Alexandrov curvature of the geodesic space determines the relationship between these two dispersion measures. This suggests a novel test for inferring the curvature of a space based on the asymptotic distribution of the dispersion measures. We demonstrate how this test can be employed to detect the intrinsic curvature of an unknown underlying space, which emerges as a joint property of the space and the underlying probability measure that generates the random objects. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the test and its finite-sample behavior for various data types, including distributional data and point cloud data. We illustrate the proposed inference for intrinsic curvature of random objects using gait synchronization data represented as symmetric positive definite matrices and energy compositional data on the sphere.</p></details> | 87 pages, 17 figures |
| **[SDFit: 3D Object Pose and Shape by Fitting a Morphable SDF to a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16178v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering 3D object pose and shape from a single image is a challenging and ill-posed problem. This is due to strong (self-)occlusions, depth ambiguities, the vast intra- and inter-class shape variance, and the lack of 3D ground truth for natural images. Existing deep-network methods are trained on synthetic datasets to predict 3D shapes, so they often struggle generalizing to real-world images. Moreover, they lack an explicit feedback loop for refining noisy estimates, and primarily focus on geometry without directly considering pixel alignment. To tackle these limitations, we develop a novel render-and-compare optimization framework, called SDFit. This has three key innovations: First, it uses a learned category-specific and morphable signed-distance-function (mSDF) model, and fits this to an image by iteratively refining both 3D pose and shape. The mSDF robustifies inference by constraining the search on the manifold of valid shapes, while allowing for arbitrary shape topologies. Second, SDFit retrieves an initial 3D shape that likely matches the image, by exploiting foundational models for efficient look-up into 3D shape databases. Third, SDFit initializes pose by establishing rich 2D-3D correspondences between the image and the mSDF through foundational features. We evaluate SDFit on three image datasets, i.e., Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and COMIC. SDFit performs on par with SotA feed-forward networks for unoccluded images and common poses, but is uniquely robust to occlusions and uncommon poses. Moreover, it requires no retraining for unseen images. Thus, SDFit contributes new insights for generalizing in the wild. Code is available at https://anticdimi.github.io/sdfit.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV'...</summary><p>ICCV'25 Camera Ready; 12 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[An approach to robust Bayesian regression in astronomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02380v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model mis-specification (e.g. the presence of outliers) is commonly encountered in astronomical analyses, often requiring the use of ad hoc algorithms which are sensitive to arbitrary thresholds (e.g. sigma-clipping). For any given dataset, the optimal approach will be to develop a bespoke statistical model of the data generation and measurement processes, but these come with a development cost; there is hence utility in having generic modelling approaches that are both principled and robust to model mis-specification. Here we develop and implement a generic Bayesian approach to linear regression, based on Student's t-distributions, that is robust to outliers and mis-specification of the noise model. Our method is validated using simulated datasets with various degrees of model mis-specification; the derived constraints are shown to be systematically less biased than those from a similar model using normal distributions. We demonstrate that, for a dataset without outliers, a worst-case inference using t-distributions would give unbiased results with $\lesssim\!10$ per cent increase in the reported parameter uncertainties. We also compare with existing analyses of real-world datasets, finding qualitatively different results where normal distributions have been used and agreement where more robust methods have been applied. A Python implementation of this model, t-cup, is made available for others to use.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 21 figures; accepted for publication in RASTI</p></details> |

OpenAI's recent model, O1, showcased impressive capabilities in solving complex problems by utilizing extensive reasoning chains. This prompts an important question: can robot models achieve better performance in multi-task , complex environments by reviewing prior observations and then providing task-specific reasoning to guide action prediction? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Affordance (CoA-VLA) , a novel approach to scaling robot models by incorporating reasoning in the format of sequential robot affordances to facilitate task completion. Specifically, we prompt the model to consider the following four types of affordances before taking action: (1) object affordance - what object to manipulate and where it is ; (2) grasp affordance - the specific object part to grasp ; (3) spatial affordance - the optimal space to place the object ; and (4) movement affordance-the collision - free path for movement. We further transform each affordance into two prompting formats: visual affordance and textual affordance. We introduce a novel vision-language co-injection module that integrates this knowledge into the policy network. This allows the robot to leverage essential contextual information during action inference, resulting in improved precision and robustness. Our experiments demonstrate that CoA-VLA outperforms state-of-the-art robot foundation models, including OpenVLA and Octo, on a variety of tasks. Furthermore, CoA-VLA exhibits strong generalization capabilities, including recognizing unseen object poses, identifying free space, and avoiding obstacles in novel environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage is available at https://chain-of-affordance.github.io</p></details> |

The main challenge lies in inferring unseen appearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism. Most previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views; however, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in unrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations, we leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by sampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the limited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all image details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior, ensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and enforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel approach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by fitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models. The generative avatar provides a meaningful initialization for model fitting, enforces 3D regularization, and helps in refining pose estimation. Experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques and generalizes well to real-world scenarios. Our Gaussian avatars are also inherently animatable</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlight), Project Page: https://zj-dong.github.io/MoGA/</p></details> |

However, they suffer from limitations in performance, compression ratio, and lack of native support for RDF streams. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Jelly, a fast and convenient binary serialization format for RDF data that supports both batch and streaming use cases. Jelly is designed to maximize serialization throughput, reduce file size with lightweight streaming compression, and minimize compute resource usage. Built on Protocol Buffers, Jelly is easy to integrate with modern programming languages and RDF libraries. To maximize reusability, Jelly has an open protocol specification, open-source implementations in Java and Python integrated with popular RDF libraries, and a versatile command-line tool. To illustrate its usefulness, we outline concrete use cases where Jelly can provide tangible benefits. We consider that by combining practical usability with state-of-the-art efficiency, Jelly is an important contribution to the Semantic Web tool stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Devel...</summary><p>Developers Workshop, co-located with SEMANTiCS'25: International Conference on Semantic Systems, September 3-5, 2025, Vienna, Austria</p></details> |

In this work, we present an energy-efficient implementation of a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm using quantized SNNs to solve two classical control tasks. The network is trained using the Q-learning algorithm, then fine-tuned and quantized to low-bit (8-bit) precision for embedded deployment on the SpiNNaker2 neuromorphic chip. To evaluate the comparative advantage of SpiNNaker2 over conventional computing platforms, we analyze inference latency, dynamic power consumption, and energy cost per inference for our SNN models, comparing performance against a GTX 1650 GPU baseline. Our results demonstrate SpiNNaker2's strong potential for scalable, low-energy neuromorphic computing, achieving up to 32x reduction in energy consumption. Inference latency remains on par with GPU-based execution, with improvements observed in certain task settings, reinforcing SpiNNaker2's viability for real-time neuromorphic control and making the neuromorphic approach a compelling direction for efficient deep Q-learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The controller is based on a Gaussian Process (GP) whose realizations satisfy a system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. Control inputs for tracking are determined by conditioning the prior GP on the setpoints, i.e. control as inference. The resulting Model Predictive Control scheme incorporates pointwise soft constraints by introducing virtual setpoints to the posterior Gaussian process.

VRD models trained solely on relation detection data struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained. While prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for VRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations. We argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by fine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an Adaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction tuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an instruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART directs the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining generalizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where subject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between them. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets of varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and can infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD methods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations for segmenting complex scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Given a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. We obtain the first subquadratic-time algorithm that works under this assumption, for unrestricted vectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Nudge Average Treatment Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23590v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The instrumental variable method is a prominent approach to recover under certain conditions, valid inference about a treatment causal effect even when unmeasured confounding might be present. In a groundbreaking paper, Imbens and Angrist (1994) established that a valid instrument nonparametrically identifies the average causal effect among compliers, also known as the local average treatment effect under a certain monotonicity assumption which rules out the existence of so-called defiers. An often-cited attractive property of monotonicity is that it facilitates a causal interpretation of the instrumental variable estimand without restricting the degree of heterogeneity of the treatment causal effect. In this paper, we introduce an alternative equally straightforward and interpretable condition for identification, which accommodates both the presence of defiers and heterogenous treatment effects. Mainly, we show that under our new conditions, the instrumental variable estimand recovers the average causal effect for the subgroup of units for whom the treatment is manipulable by the instrument, a subgroup which may consist of both defiers and compliers, therefore recovering an effect estimand we aptly call the Nudge Average Treatment Effect.</p></details> | 18 pages |

We analyze when this uncertainty is consequential enough to warrant methodological solutions (Bayesian model averaging over competing causal structures). Focusing on bivariate relationships ($X \rightarrow Y$ vs. $X \leftarrow Y$), we establish that model averaging is beneficial when: (1) structural uncertainty is moderate to high, (2) causal effects differ substantially between structures, and (3) loss functions are sufficiently sensitive to the size of the causal effect. We prove optimality results of our suggested methodological solution under regularity conditions and demonstrate through simulations that modern causal discovery methods can provide, within limits, the necessary quantification. Our framework complements existing robust causal inference approaches by addressing a distinct source of uncertainty typically overlooked in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is under review at the Journal of Causal Inference</p></details> |

Probabilistic cataloging solves the general point-source inference problem, but the trans-dimensional nature of the inference method requires a bespoke approach that is difficult to scale. Here it is shown that probabilistic cataloging can be performed in a fixed-dimensional framework called Parametric Cataloging under mild assumptions on some of the priors. The method requires only a simple reparameterization of the flux coordinates, yielding an accessible method that can be implemented in most probabilistic programming environments. As the parameter space is fixed-dimensional, off the shelf gradient based samplers can be employed which allows the method to scale to tens of thousands of sources.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

These prognostic covariates are often constructed from historical data by fitting a predictive model of the outcome on the raw covariates. A natural question that we have been asked by applied researchers is whether this can be done without the historical data: can the prognostic covariate be constructed or derived from the trial data itself, possibly using different folds of the data, before adjusting for it? Here we clarify that such ``within-trial'' prognostic adjustment is nothing more than a form of targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), a well-studied procedure for optimal inference. We demonstrate the equivalence with a simulation study and discuss the pros and cons of within-trial prognostic adjustment (standard efficient estimation) relative to standard TMLE and standard prognostic adjustment with historical data.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

Because the function instances cloud providers start to execute user code run on shared infrastructure, their performance can vary. From a user perspective, slower instances not only take longer to complete, but also increase cost due to the pay-per-use model of FaaS services where execution duration is billed with microsecond accuracy. In this paper, we present Minos, a system to take advantage of this performance variation by intentionally terminating instances that are slow. Fast instances are not terminated, so that they can be re-used for subsequent invocations. One use case for this are data processing and machine learning workflows, which often download files as a first step, during which Minos can run a short benchmark. Only if the benchmark passes, the main part of the function is actually executed. Otherwise, the request is re-queued and the instance crashes itself, so that the platform has to assign the request to another (potentially faster) instance. In our experiments, this leads to a speedup of up to 13% in the resource intensive part of a data processing workflow, resulting in up to 4% faster overall performance (and consequently 4% cheaper prices). Longer and complex workflows lead to increased savings, as the pool of fast instances is re-used more often. For platforms exhibiting this behavior, users get better performance and save money by wasting more of the platforms resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication at the 13th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Engineering (IC2E 2025)</p></details> |

First, existing methods depend on 3D training data collected from limited environments, constraining out-of-distribution generalization. The second issue is the difficulty of estimating metric-scale poses from monocular input. To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel framework that performs multi-view lifting from monocular input by leveraging 2D data pre-training, enabling the reconstruction of metrically accurate 3D motions with absolute positions. To leverage abundant 2D data, we decompose complex 3D motion into multi-view syntheses. We first pretrain a single-view diffusion model on extensive 2D datasets, then fine-tune a multi-view model using public 3D data to enable view-consistent motion generation from monocular input, allowing the model to acquire action priors and diversity through 2D data. Furthermore, to recover absolute poses, we propose a novel human motion representation that decouples the learning of local pose and global movements, while encoding geometric priors of the ground to accelerate convergence. This enables progressive recovery of motion in absolute space during inference. Experimental results on in-the-wild benchmarks demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both camera-space motion realism and world-grounded human positioning, while exhibiting superior generalization capability.

However, existing models struggle with high-resolution images due to the discrepancy in image resolutions of training (with smaller resolutions) and inference (for high resolutions). Processing them at full resolution leads to decreased estimation accuracy on depth with tremendous memory consumption, while downsampling to the training resolution results in blurred edges in the estimated depth images. Prevailing high-resolution depth estimation methods adopt a patch-based approach, which introduces depth discontinuity issues when reassembling the estimated depth patches, resulting in test-time inefficiency. Additionally, to obtain fine-grained depth details, these methods rely on synthetic datasets due to the real-world sparse ground truth depth, leading to poor generalizability. To tackle these limitations, we propose Patch Refine Once (PRO), an efficient and generalizable tile-based framework. Our PRO consists of two key components: (i) Grouped Patch Consistency Training that enhances test-time efficiency while mitigating the depth discontinuity problem by jointly processing four overlapping patches and enforcing a consistency loss on their overlapping regions within a single backpropagation step, and (ii) Bias Free Masking that prevents the DE models from overfitting to dataset-specific biases, enabling better generalization to real-world datasets even after training on synthetic data. Zero-shot evaluations on Booster, ETH3D, Middlebury 2014, and NuScenes demonstrate that our PRO can be seamlessly integrated into existing depth estimation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (camera-ready version).

In contrast to supervised methods, OOD-based approaches function without labels and are inherently robust to data imbalances. Current generative approaches often rely on likelihood estimation or reconstruction error, but these methods can be computationally expensive, unreliable, and require retraining if the inlier data changes. These limitations hinder their ability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently, and robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that leverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising diffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated Stein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five diffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned medical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing computational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM achieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and Far-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable computer-aided diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Uncertainty for Safe Utilization of Machine Learning in Medical Imaging, MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

With the increasing adoption of distributed generation and emerging prosumer households, Energy Management Systems, which manage and apply flexibility of connected devices, are gaining popularity. While potentially beneficial to grid capacity, strategic energy management also adds to the complexity of distribution grid operation and planning processes. Novel approaches of time-series-based planning likewise face increasingly complex simulation scenarios and rising computational cost. Discrete event modelling helps facilitating simulations of such scenarios by restraining computation to the most relevant points in simulation time. We provide an enhancement of a discrete event distribution grid simulation software that offers fast implementation and testing of energy management algorithms, embedded into a feature-rich simulation environment. Physical models are specified using the Discrete Event System Specification.

Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhance reliability by eliciting intermediate reasoning steps or aggregating multiple outputs. However, they lack mechanisms for enforcing logical structure and assessing internal coherence. We introduce Theorem-of-Thought (ToTh), a novel framework that models reasoning as collaboration among three parallel agents, each simulating a distinct mode of inference: abductive, deductive, and inductive. Each agent produces a reasoning trace, which is structured into a formal reasoning graph. To evaluate consistency, we apply Bayesian belief propagation guided by natural language inference (NLI), assigning confidence scores to each step. The most coherent graph is selected to derive the final answer. Experiments on symbolic (WebOfLies) and numerical (MultiArith) reasoning benchmarks show that ToTh consistently outperforms CoT, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding across multiple LLMs, while producing interpretable and logically grounded reasoning chains. Our findings suggest a promising direction for building more robust and cognitively inspired LLM reasoning.

To enhance inference efficiency, most existing approaches can be categorized as parameter-dependent or token-dependent strategies to reduce computational demands. However, parameter-dependent methods require retraining LVLMs to recover performance while token-dependent strategies struggle to consistently select the most relevant tokens. In this paper, we systematically analyze the above challenges and provide a series of valuable insights for inference acceleration. Based on these findings, we propose a novel framework, the Pruning All-Rounder (PAR). Different from previous works, PAR develops a meta-router to adaptively organize pruning flows across both tokens and layers. With a self-supervised learning manner, our method achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency. Notably, PAR is highly flexible, offering multiple pruning versions to address a range of acceleration scenarios.

While they exhibit strong zero-shot performance on various tasks, LLMs' effectiveness in music-related applications remains limited due to the relatively small proportion of music-specific knowledge in their training data. To address this limitation, we propose MusT-RAG, a comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to adapt general-purpose LLMs for text-only music question answering (MQA) tasks. RAG is a technique that provides external knowledge to LLMs by retrieving relevant context information when generating answers to questions. To optimize RAG for the music domain, we (1) propose MusWikiDB, a music-specialized vector database for the retrieval stage, and (2) utilizes context information during both inference and fine-tuning processes to effectively transform general-purpose LLMs into music-specific models. Our experiment demonstrates that MusT-RAG significantly outperforms traditional fine-tuning approaches in enhancing LLMs' music domain adaptation capabilities, showing consistent improvements across both in-domain and out-of-domain MQA benchmarks. Additionally, our MusWikiDB proves substantially more effective than general Wikipedia corpora, delivering superior performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

| **[DHCP: Detecting Hallucinations by Cross-modal Attention Pattern in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18659v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on complex multimodal tasks. However, they continue to suffer from significant hallucination issues, including object, attribute, and relational hallucinations. To accurately detect these hallucinations, we investigated the variations in cross-modal attention patterns between hallucination and non-hallucination states. Leveraging these distinctions, we developed a lightweight detector capable of identifying hallucinations. Our proposed method, Detecting Hallucinations by Cross-modal Attention Patterns (DHCP), is straightforward and does not require additional LVLM training or extra LVLM inference steps. Experimental results show that DHCP achieves remarkable performance in hallucination detection. By offering novel insights into the identification and analysis of hallucinations in LVLMs, DHCP contributes to advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of these models. The code is available at https://github.com/btzyd/DHCP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Multimedia 2025</p></details> |
| **[MemShare: Memory Efficient Inference for Large Reasoning Models through KV Cache Reuse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21433v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead. MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\% improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to existing KV cache management methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Impact of Hyperparameter Optimization on the Accuracy of Lightweight Deep Learning Models for Real-Time Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23315v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based models have become vital for real-time image classification in resource-constrained applications, such as embedded systems and edge devices. This work analyzes the influence of hyperparameter adjustment on the accuracy and convergence behavior of seven efficient deep learning architectures: EfficientNetV2-S, ConvNeXt-T, MobileViT v2 (XXS/XS/S), MobileNetV3-L, TinyViT-21M, and RepVGG-A2. All models are trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset under consistent training settings, with an emphasis on real-time practicality. An comprehensive ablation study is undertaken to separate the effect of critical hyperparameters, including learning rate schedules, batch sizes, input resolution, data augmentation, regularization approaches, and optimizer choice. To assess appropriateness for real-time applications, each model is assessed not only in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy, but also in terms of inference time, parameter count, model size, and frames-per-second (FPS) on a GPU-accelerated edge deployment simulation. Results demonstrate that cosine learning rate decay and adjustable batch size may greatly boost both accuracy and convergence speed, while keeping low latency and memory cost. Notably, RepVGG-A2 achieves over 80% Top-1 accuracy with efficient inference performance, offering a compelling balance between accuracy and deployment cost for VGG-style models. The results give practical guidance for constructing resource-efficient deep learning models appropriate for real-time image processing pipelines.

| **[iLRM: An Iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23277v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed. Notably, iLRM exhibits superior scalability, delivering significantly higher reconstruction quality under comparable computational cost by efficiently leveraging a larger number of input views.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://gynjn.github.io/iLRM/</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Dive into Generic Object Tracking: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23251v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generic object tracking remains an important yet challenging task in computer vision due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics, especially in the presence of occlusions, similar distractors, and appearance variations. Over the past two decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers, discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 29 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive sample splitting for randomization tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21572v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomization tests are widely used to generate finite-sample valid $p$-values for causal inference on experimental data. However, when applied to subgroup analysis, these tests may lack power due to small subgroup sizes. Incorporating a shared estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) can substantially improve power across subgroups but requires sample splitting to preserve validity. To this end, we quantify each unit's contribution to estimation and testing using a certainty score, which measures how certain the unit's treatment assignment is given its covariates and outcome. We show that units with higher certainty scores are more valuable for testing but less important for CATE estimation, since their treatment assignments can be accurately imputed. Building on this insight, we propose AdaSplit, a sample splitting procedure that adaptively allocates units between estimation and testing to maximize their overall contribution across tasks. We evaluate AdaSplit through simulation studies, demonstrating that it yields more powerful randomization tests than baselines that omit CATE estimation or rely on random sample splitting. Finally, we apply AdaSplit to a blood pressure intervention trial, identifying patient subgroups with significant treatment effects.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Balancing Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation for Unified Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05164v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multi-source images, enhancing image quality through a unified framework applicable to diverse fusion tasks. While treating all fusion tasks as a unified problem facilitates task-invariant knowledge sharing, it often overlooks task-specific characteristics, thereby limiting the overall performance. Existing general image fusion methods incorporate explicit task identification to enable adaptation to different fusion tasks. However, this dependence during inference restricts the model's generalization to unseen fusion tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel unified image fusion framework named "TITA", which dynamically balances both Task-invariant Interaction and Task-specific Adaptation. For task-invariant interaction, we introduce the Interaction-enhanced Pixel Attention (IPA) module to enhance pixel-wise interactions for better multi-source complementary information extraction. For task-specific adaptation, the Operation-based Adaptive Fusion (OAF) module dynamically adjusts operation weights based on task properties. Additionally, we incorporate the Fast Adaptive Multitask Optimization (FAMO) strategy to mitigate the impact of gradient conflicts across tasks during joint training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TITA not only achieves competitive performance compared to specialized methods across three image fusion scenarios but also exhibits strong generalization to unseen fusion tasks.

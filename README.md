| **[Generative Modeling of Weights: Generalization or Memorization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07998v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have recently been explored for synthesizing neural network weights. These approaches take neural network checkpoints as training data and aim to generate high-performing weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative, well-known methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Contrary to claims in prior work, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or, at best, simple interpolations of the training checkpoints. Moreover, they fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. Our further analysis suggests that this memorization might result from limited data, overparameterized models, and the underuse of structural priors specific to weight data. These findings highlight the need for more careful design and rigorous evaluation of generative models when applied to new domains.

| **[Cheat-Penalised Quantum Weak Coin-Flipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03218v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coin-flipping is a fundamental task in two-party cryptography where two remote mistrustful parties wish to generate a shared uniformly random bit. While quantum protocols promising near-perfect security exist for weak coin-flipping -- when the parties want opposing outcomes -- it has been shown that they must be inefficient in terms of their round complexity, and it is an open question of how space efficient they can be. In this work, we consider a variant called cheat-penalised weak coin-flipping in which if a party gets caught cheating, they lose $\Lambda$ points (compared to $0$ in the standard definition). We find that already for a small cheating penalty, the landscape of coin-flipping changes dramatically. For example, with $\Lambda=0.01$, we exhibit a protocol where neither Alice nor Bob can bias the result in their favour beyond $1/2 + 10^{-8}$, which uses $24$ qubits and $10^{16}$ rounds of communication (provably $10^{7}$ times better than any weak coin-flipping protocol with matching security). For the same space requirements, we demonstrate how one can choose between lowering how much a malicious party can bias the result (down to $1/2 + 10^{-10}$) and reducing the rounds of communication (down to $25,180$), depending on what is preferred. To find these protocols, we make two technical contributions. First, we extend the point game-protocol correspondence introduced by Kitaev and Mochon, to incorporate: (i) approximate point games, (ii) the cheat-penalised setting, and (iii) round and space complexity. Second, we give the first (to the best of our knowledge) numerical algorithm for constructing (approximate) point games that correspond to high security and low complexity. Our results open up the possibility of having secure and practical quantum protocols for multiparty computation.</p></details> | 61 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Wave-GMS: Lightweight Multi-Scale Generative Model for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03216v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For equitable deployment of AI tools in hospitals and healthcare facilities, we need Deep Segmentation Networks that offer high performance and can be trained on cost-effective GPUs with limited memory and large batch sizes. In this work, we propose Wave-GMS, a lightweight and efficient multi-scale generative model for medical image segmentation. Wave-GMS has a substantially smaller number of trainable parameters, does not require loading memory-intensive pretrained vision foundation models, and supports training with large batch sizes on GPUs with limited memory. We conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (BUS, BUSI, Kvasir-Instrument, and HAM10000), demonstrating that Wave-GMS achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with superior cross-domain generalizability, while requiring only ~2.6M trainable parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/ATPLab-LUMS/Wave-GMS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables; Submitted to IEEE Conference for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[To Distill or Decide? Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03207v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially observable domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 9 figures, published at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion: Make Your Diffusion Language Model a Latent Reasoner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03206v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Automatic Generation of Digital Twins for Network Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03205v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increased use of software in the operation and management of telecommunication networks has moved the industry one step closer to realizing autonomous network operation. One consequence of this shift is the significantly increased need for testing and validation before such software can be deployed. Complementing existing simulation or hardware-based approaches, digital twins present an environment to achieve this testing; however, they require significant time and human effort to configure and execute. This paper explores the automatic generation of digital twins to provide efficient and accurate validation tools, aligned to the ITU-T autonomous network architecture's experimentation subsystem. We present experimental results for an initial use case, demonstrating that the approach is feasible in automatically creating efficient digital twins with sufficient accuracy to be included as part of existing validation pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ANMS at ICDCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model-Based Ranking of Source Languages for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03202v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on 56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and 18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all available target data for ranking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14052v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods -- whether sparse or dense -- often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 26K expert-annotated examples on S&P-500 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Best-of-Majority: Minimax-Optimal Strategy for Pass@$k$ Inference Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03199v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently, evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses, and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with $k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM), with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is $O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$ is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound, certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.</p></details> | 29 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Memory Forcing: Spatio-Temporal Memory for Consistent Scene Generation on Minecraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03198v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency, whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context. We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames, while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[The Challenges of Hyperparameter Tuning for Accurate Causal Effect Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01412v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ML is playing an increasingly crucial role in estimating causal effects of treatments on outcomes from observational data. Many ML methods (`causal estimators') have been proposed for this task. All of these methods, as with any ML approach, require extensive hyperparameter tuning. For non-causal predictive tasks, there is a consensus on the choice of tuning metrics (e.g. mean squared error), making it simple to compare models. However, for causal inference tasks, such a consensus is yet to be reached, making any comparison of causal models difficult. On top of that, there is no ideal metric on which to tune causal estimators, so one must rely on proxies. Furthermore, the fact that model selection in causal inference involves multiple components (causal estimator, ML regressor, hyperparameters, metric), complicates the issue even further. In order to evaluate the importance of each component, we perform an extensive empirical study on their combination. Our experimental setup involves many commonly used causal estimators, regressors (`base learners' henceforth) and metrics applied to four well-known causal inference benchmark datasets. Our results show that hyperparameter tuning increased the probability of reaching state-of-the-art performance in average ($65\% {\rightarrow} 81\%$) and individualised ($50\% {\rightarrow} 57\%$) effect estimation with only commonly used estimators. We also show that the performance of standard metrics can be inconsistent across different scenarios. Our findings highlight the need for further research to establish whether metrics uniformly capable of state-of-the-art performance in causal model evaluation can be found.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantially revised version. 18 pages of main content (33 pages in total), 4 main figures (11 in total)</p></details> |
| **[Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching for Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05940v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While denoising diffusion and flow matching have driven major advances in generative modeling, their application to tabular data remains limited, despite its ubiquity in real-world applications. To this end, we develop TabbyFlow, a variational Flow Matching (VFM) method for tabular data generation. To apply VFM to data with mixed continuous and discrete features, we introduce Exponential Family Variational Flow Matching (EF-VFM), which represents heterogeneous data types using a general exponential family distribution. We hereby obtain an efficient, data-driven objective based on moment matching, enabling principled learning of probability paths over mixed continuous and discrete variables. We also establish a connection between variational flow matching and generalized flow matching objectives based on Bregman divergences. Evaluation on tabular data benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 1 figure, and 9 tables; To be published in the Proceedings of the Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |
| **[Understanding How CodeLLMs (Mis)Predict Types with Activation Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01903v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used by software engineers for programming tasks. However, research shows that LLMs often lack a deep understanding of program semantics. Even minor changes to syntax, such as renaming variables, can significantly degrade performance across various tasks. In this work, we examine the task of type prediction: given a partially typed program, can a model predict a missing type annotations such that the resulting program is more typed? We construct a dataset of adversarial examples where models initially predict the correct types, but begin to fail after semantically irrelevant edits. This is problematic, as models should ideally generalize across different syntactic forms of semantically equivalent code. This lack of robustness suggests that models may have a shallow understanding of code semantics. Despite this, we provide evidence that LLMs do, in fact, learn robust mechanisms for type prediction-though these mechanisms often fail to activate in adversarial scenarios. By using activation steering, a method that manipulates a model's internal activations to guide it toward using latent knowledge, we restore accurate predictions on adversarial inputs. We show that steering successfully activates a type prediction mechanism that is shared by both Python and TypeScript, and is more effective than prompting with in-context examples. Across five different models, our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that LLMs can learn generalizable representations of code semantics that transfer across programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 67 figures.

| **[Tuning LLM-based Code Optimization via Meta-Prompting: An Industrial Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01443v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a growing interest in leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) for automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of multi-LLM systems in production environments. We introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages metaprompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts. It is an essential part of the ARTEMIS code optimization platform for automated validation and scaling. Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting and that major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters, providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE'25 Industry Showcase</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Online Data to Enhance Medical Knowledge in a Small Persian Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16000v4)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This study introduces a newly curated dataset comprising 20k doctor-patient Q\&A pairs and 60\% of a 90-million-token crawled corpus from medical magazines. Using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, we enhanced the medical knowledge of the baseline model, aya-expanse-8b. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved accuracy in medical question answering and successfully passed the Iranian Basic Medical Science Entrance Exam (IBSEE) in September 2023, which the baseline model did not. Additionally, the fine-tuned model improved Persian-translated MMLU accuracy by an average of 2.67\%. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for resource-constrained environments. Future research could explore multimodal input to further enhance performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Simulation to Rules: A Dual-VLM Framework for Formal Visual Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03182v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios, simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.

The lighting-conditioned NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.

These correlations have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations between brain representations and those from models are specific to models trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at NeurIPS 2025 Workshops</p></details> |

They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 main; The first two authors contribute equally.

This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of UKCI 2025</p></details> |

Evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 2 algorithms, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[MM-Nav: Multi-View VLA Model for Robust Visual Navigation via Multi-Expert Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03142v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pku-epic.github.io/MM-Nav-Web/</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://reagan1311.github.io/mask2iv</p></details> |

We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first Bayesian nonparametric framework targeting total robustness that tackles all three challenges in general nonlinear regression. The framework assigns a Dirichlet process prior to the latent covariate-response distribution and updates it with posterior pseudo-samples of the latent covariates, thereby providing the Dirichlet process posterior with observation-informed latent inputs and yielding estimators that minimise the discrepancy between Dirichlet process realisations and the model-induced joint law. This design allows practitioners to (i) encode prior beliefs, (ii) choose between pseudo-sampling latent covariates or working directly with error-prone observations, and (iii) tune the influence of prior and data. We establish generalisation bounds that tighten whenever the prior or pseudo-sample generator aligns with the underlying data generating process, ensuring robustness without sacrificing consistency. A gradient-based algorithm enables efficient computations; simulations and two real-world studies show lower estimation error and reduced estimation sensitivity to misspecification compared to Bayesian and frequentist competitors. The framework, therefore, offers a practical and interpretable paradigm for trustworthy regression when data and models are jointly imperfect.</p></details> | 77 pages, 13 figures |

Backtracking naturally scales test-time compute by enabling sequential, linearized exploration via long chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, this is not the only strategy for scaling test time-compute: parallel sampling with best-of-N selection provides an alternative that generates diverse solutions simultaneously. Despite the growing adoption of sequential search, its advantages over parallel sampling-especially under a fixed compute budget-remain poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically compare these two approaches on two challenging reasoning tasks: CountDown and Sudoku. Surprisingly, we find that sequential search underperforms parallel sampling on CountDown but outperforms it on Sudoku, suggesting that backtracking is not universally beneficial. We identify two factors that can cause backtracking to degrade performance: (1) training on fixed search traces can lock models intro suboptimal strategies, and (2) explicit CoT supervision can discourage implicit (non verbalized) reasoning. Extending our analysis to reinforcement learning (RL), we show that models with backtracking capabilities benefit significantly from RL fine-tuning, while models without backtracking see limited, mixed gains. Together, these findings challenge the assumption that backtracking universally enhances LLM reasoning, instead revealing a complex interaction between task structure, training data, model scale, and learning paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Existing approaches fall into post-training binarization, which is simple but causes severe performance loss, and training-aware methods, which depend on full-precision latent weights, adding complexity and limiting efficiency. We propose a novel framework that represents LLMs with multi-kernel Boolean parameters and, for the first time, enables direct finetuning LMMs in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for latent weights. This enhances representational capacity and dramatically reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs show our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

While there are some theoretical and primary empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.</p></details> | 27 pages |

To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency, whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context. We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames, while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |

Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures; Accepted to ACL 2025</p></details> |

While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, NeurIPS 2025 Workshop MLForSys</p></details> |

When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing \underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with \underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer, filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM MM'25</p></details> |

In the US, more than 90% of airport control towers are understaffed, falling short of FAA and union standards. This, in part, has contributed to an uptick in near-misses and safety-critical events, highlighting the need for advancements in air traffic management technologies to ensure safe and efficient operations. Data-driven predictive models for terminal airspace show potential to address these challenges; however, the lack of large-scale surface movement datasets in the public domain has hindered the development of scalable and generalizable approaches. To address this, we introduce Amelia-42, a first-of-its-kind large collection of raw airport surface movement reports streamed through the FAA's System Wide Information Management (SWIM) Program, comprising over two years of trajectory data (~9.19 TB) across 42 US airports. We open-source tools to process this data into clean tabular position reports. We release Amelia42-Mini, a 15-day sample per airport, fully processed data on HuggingFace for ease of use. We also present a trajectory forecasting benchmark consisting of Amelia10-Bench, an accessible experiment family using 292 days from 10 airports, as well as Amelia-TF, a transformer-based baseline for multi-agent trajectory forecasting.

| **[Towards Provable Emergence of In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18389v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typically, a modern reinforcement learning (RL) agent solves a task by updating its neural network parameters to adapt its policy to the task. Recently, it has been observed that some RL agents can solve a wide range of new out-of-distribution tasks without parameter updates after pretraining on some task distribution. When evaluated in a new task, instead of making parameter updates, the pretrained agent conditions its policy on additional input called the context, e.g., the agent's interaction history in the new task. The agent's performance increases as the information in the context increases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically called in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network enable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the pretraining with standard RL algorithms. This raises the central question this paper aims to address: Why can the RL pretraining algorithm generate network parameters that enable ICRL? We hypothesize that the parameters capable of ICRL are minimizers of the pretraining loss. This work provides initial support for this hypothesis through a case study. In particular, we prove that when a Transformer is pretrained for policy evaluation, one of the global minimizers of the pretraining loss can enable in-context temporal difference learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 29 pages</p></details> |

This paper leverages a real-world, multi-operator drive-test dataset of 30,925 labelled records collected within a 2 km area around Sunway City to investigate sequence-based deep learning approaches for handover detection and avoidance. We formulate handover prediction as a sequence problem and evaluate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer architectures under Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)-only and all-feature settings. The integration of multi-dimensional features significantly enhanced handover performance in dense urban cellular networks. The proposed GRU-based model achieved a remarkable 98% reduction in ping-pong handovers, alongside a 46.25% decrease in unnecessary handovers, outperforming the baseline RSRP-only approach which yielded a 22.19% reduction. Furthermore, the model demonstrated a 46% improvement in Time of Stay (ToS), indicating more stable user connections. With an inference time of just 0.91 seconds, the solution proves highly efficient and well-suited for real-time edge deployment scenarios. Compared to the conventional 3GPP A3 algorithm, these improvements demonstrate significant gains in mobility robustness and user Quality of Experience (QoE) improvement. The dataset is released to foster reproducibility and further research in intelligent mobility management for 5G and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |

In this work, we show that pairing LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse, interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from less favorable to aesthetically enhanced perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, previous audio hiding methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio, due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, project page: https://cyberrrange.github.io/project/wavinwav</p></details> |

While decoding-time strategies provide a promising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat token-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint dynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware, layer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types with their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation. Through empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation tokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens govern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing attention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the induction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to guide the final factual decoding. Our method requires no additional training or model modification, and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves factuality across multiple LLMs and various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission was made before undergoing the required review by the co-authors' affiliated institutions.

This task has gained increasing attention due to its wide range of applications, such as film production, dubbing, and virtual avatars. Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech intelligibility, audio-video synchronization, speech naturalness, and voice similarity to the reference speaker. To address these challenges, we propose AlignDiT, a multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer that generates accurate, synchronized, and natural-sounding speech from aligned multimodal inputs. Built upon the in-context learning capability of the DiT architecture, AlignDiT explores three effective strategies to align multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal classifier-free guidance mechanism that allows the model to adaptively balance information from each modality during speech synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDiT significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks in terms of quality, synchronization, and speaker similarity. Moreover, AlignDiT exhibits strong generalization capability across various multimodal tasks, such as video-to-speech synthesis and visual forced alignment, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.

These accelerators are costly and it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations. We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy. Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time, enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload. We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only 0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model over 8-bit model.

Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJRR.

Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city road networks. This dataset features graphs with over 100k nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs based on local node eccentricities, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement-particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution-which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, these networks face two key challenges: (1) large coverage footprints that create frequent collisions and (2) moving gateways that cause dynamic links and demand synchronization-free, link-aware transmissions. Existing random access schemes such as ALOHA, CSMA, and BSMA fail in this setting, suffering from high collision rates, hidden terminals, or excessive gateway energy overhead. We propose Free Signal Multiple Access (FSMA), a gateway-controlled protocol that introduces a lightweight free signal chirp (FreeChirp). FreeChirp ensures that nodes transmit only when the channel is idle and when links are reliable, thereby reducing collisions and enabling link-aware access without the need for synchronization or complex scheduling. We evaluate FSMA using 25 commercial LoRa devices with a drone-mounted moving gateway and demonstrate up to 2x higher throughput, 2x to 5x better packet reception ratio, and 5x improved energy efficiency compared to the baselines. Large-scale simulations with a custom Satellite IoT Simulator further show that FSMA scales to 5000+ devices per satellite pass. These results establish FSMA as a practical step toward scalable, energy-efficient, and reliable NTN IoT networks.</p></details> | 14 pages, 19 figures |

We propose $\textit{DiffusionBlocks}$, a principled framework for transforming transformer-based networks into genuinely independent trainable blocks that maintain competitive performance with end-to-end training. Our key insight leverages the fact that residual connections naturally correspond to updates in a dynamical system. With minimal modifications to this system, we can convert the updates to those of a denoising process, where each block can be learned independently by leveraging the score matching objective. This independence enables training with gradients for only one block at a time, thereby reducing memory requirements in proportion to the number of blocks. Our experiments on a range of transformer architectures (vision, diffusion, autoregressive, recurrent-depth, and masked diffusion) demonstrate that DiffusionBlocks training matches the performance of end-to-end training while enabling scalable block-wise training on practical tasks beyond small-scale classification. DiffusionBlocks provides a theoretically grounded approach that successfully scales to modern generative tasks across diverse architectures.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02038v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures. The code is available at https://github.com/youngsheen/SimVQ.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV2025 |

This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We present SAE- RNA, interpretability model that analyzes RiNALMo representations and maps them to known human-level biological features. Our work frames RNA interpretability as concept discovery in pretrained embeddings, without end-to-end retraining, and provides practical tools to probe what RNA LMs may encode about ncRNA families. The model can be extended to close comparisons between RNA groups, and supporting hypothesis generation about previously unrecognized relationships.</p></details> | preprint |

Unlike conventional methods where the color transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low computational complexity and small model size.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, accepted at IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability, efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net, a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records, demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 18 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

By leveraging a Lamperti transformation, we develop a novel, explicit, and unconditionally positivity-preserving numerical scheme for the considered financial SDEs. More precisely, an implicit term $c_{-1}Y_{n+1}^{-1}$ is incorporated in the scheme to guarantee unconditional positivity preservation, and a corrective operator is introduced in the remaining explicit terms to address the challenges posed by non-Lipschitz (possibly singular) coefficients of the transformed SDEs. By finding a unique positive root of a quadratic equation, the proposed scheme can be explicitly solved and is shown to be strongly convergent with order $1$, when used to numerically solve several well-known financial models such as the CIR process, the Heston-3/2 volatility model, the CEV process and the A\"it-Sahalia model. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figures |

We introduce Subnetwork Data Parallelism (SDP), a distributed training framework that partitions a model into structured subnetworks trained across workers without exchanging activations. We study two complementary masking regimes: backward masking, which applies sparsity only in the backward step to retain unbiased gradients, and forward masking, which also removes parameters in the forward pass to deliver stronger efficiency gains while providing additional regularization. We further explore two subnetwork construction strategies: neuron level and block level, applied across both CNNs and transformers. In experiments spanning CNNs and transformers on CIFAR and ImageNet, as well as LLM pre-training on FineWeb, SDP reduces per-device memory usage by 30%-75% while maintaining or improving performance. Notably, in FLOP-matched settings, forward masking can sometimes achieve better performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figure |

However, the capacity of reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free strategies for further improvements.

Unlike previous methods that typically yield SOS decompositions with floating-point coefficients, our approach ensures that all coefficients in the decomposition remain rational. This is particularly useful in formal verification and symbolic computation, where exact arithmetic is required. We introduce a stepwise reduction technique that transforms a given polynomial into a sum of ladder-like squares while preserving rationality.

Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Fed-Span aims to address critical challenges inherent to distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites, and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span leverages minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies to introduce spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive novel convergence bounds for Fed-Span, accommodating its key system characteristics and degrees of freedom (i.e., tunable parameters). Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span. We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods, with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency. These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed learning in satellite networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Fig...</summary><p>8 Figures, 6 Appendix</p></details> |

Yet we know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words. We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.</p></details> | ASRU 2025 |

In this work, we propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability. Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and helpful AI tools for doctors.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (9 main + 2 references/appendix), 2 figures, conference paper submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Unmasking the Genuine Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04076v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type inference is crucial for reusing online code snippets. Although snippets are prevalently shared on platforms like StackOverflow, they often lack essential type information, such as fully qualified names (FQNs). Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform type inference for such code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results may suffer from data leakage, as the benchmark, StatType-SO, used for evaluation has been publicly available on GitHub since 2017. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether the strong performance of LLMs reflects genuine semantic understanding of code or is due to the ground truth being included in the training set. This paper strives to comprehensively evaluate the genuine type inference capabilities of LLMs on Java code snippets and identify potential limitations of LLMs. First, we created ThaliaType, a new, previously unreleased benchmark suite designed for type inference evaluation. Second, using the StarCoder2 LLM as baseline, we uncovered data leakage from StatType-SO in StarCoder2's open-source training set and observed that other state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit similar performance drops when evaluated on ThaliaType, with precision decreasing by up to 59% and recall by up to 72%. Finally, we designed semantic-preserving code transformations to test the capabilities of LLMs in understanding the execution semantics of snippets. Results showed that LLMs' performance on StatType-SO is far less robust to these transformations than on ThaliaType, suggesting that the performance on StatType-SO may be biased by data leakage and have limited generalizability. These findings highlight the importance of carefully designed, leakage-free benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on type inference tasks. We recommend future studies adopt ThaliaType for rigorous and reliable assessments of LLMs' genuine type inference capabilities.</p></details> | under review |

While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages, arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many open questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contribution by LYS and DM</p></details> |

However, there is little consensus on the correct method for comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon previous approaches to model-brain comparison.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures.

Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

Our approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and $55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.

We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from 18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming inference more practical.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://soroush-mim.github.io/projects/evict3r/</p></details> |

We propose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts for geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse loading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The structure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and the plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node types: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance. The results show strong predictive accuracy for both displacement and von Mises stress, effectively capturing structural behavior patterns and maximum values.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and has been submitted to Engineering with Computers</p></details> |

Intel's Advanced Matrix Extensions (AMX) is one such example, debuting on the 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable CPU. We discover a timing side and covert channel, GATEBLEED, caused by the aggressive power gating utilized to keep the CPU within operating limits. We show that the GATEBLEED side channel is a threat to AI privacy as many ML models such as transformers and CNNs make critical computationally-heavy decisions based on private values like confidence thresholds and routing logits. Timing delays from selective powering down of AMX components mean that each matrix multiplication is a potential leakage point when executed on the AMX accelerator. Our research identifies over a dozen potential gadgets across popular ML libraries (HuggingFace, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), revealing that they can leak sensitive and private information. GATEBLEED poses a risk for local and remote timing inference, even under previous protective measures. GATEBLEED can be used as a high performance, stealthy remote covert channel and a generic magnifier for timing transmission channels, capable of bypassing traditional cache defenses to leak arbitrary memory addresses and evading state of the art microarchitectural attack detectors under realistic network conditions and system configurations in which previous attacks fail. We implement an end-to-end microarchitectural inference attack on a transformer model optimized with Intel AMX, achieving a membership inference accuracy of 81% and a precision of 0.89. In a CNN-based or transformer-based mixture-of-experts model optimized with Intel AMX, we leak expert choice with 100% accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first side-channel attack on AI privacy that exploits hardware optimizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICRO 2025</p></details> |

| **[Generative Modeling of Weights: Generalization or Memorization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07998v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have recently been explored for synthesizing neural network weights. These approaches take neural network checkpoints as training data and aim to generate high-performing weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative, well-known methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Contrary to claims in prior work, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or, at best, simple interpolations of the training checkpoints. Moreover, they fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. Our further analysis suggests that this memorization might result from limited data, overparameterized models, and the underuse of structural priors specific to weight data. These findings highlight the need for more careful design and rigorous evaluation of generative models when applied to new domains.

| **[Best-of-Majority: Minimax-Optimal Strategy for Pass@$k$ Inference Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03199v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently, evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses, and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with $k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM), with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is $O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$ is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound, certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.</p></details> | 29 pages, 3 figures |
| **[The Challenges of Hyperparameter Tuning for Accurate Causal Effect Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01412v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ML is playing an increasingly crucial role in estimating causal effects of treatments on outcomes from observational data. Many ML methods (`causal estimators') have been proposed for this task. All of these methods, as with any ML approach, require extensive hyperparameter tuning. For non-causal predictive tasks, there is a consensus on the choice of tuning metrics (e.g. mean squared error), making it simple to compare models. However, for causal inference tasks, such a consensus is yet to be reached, making any comparison of causal models difficult. On top of that, there is no ideal metric on which to tune causal estimators, so one must rely on proxies. Furthermore, the fact that model selection in causal inference involves multiple components (causal estimator, ML regressor, hyperparameters, metric), complicates the issue even further. In order to evaluate the importance of each component, we perform an extensive empirical study on their combination. Our experimental setup involves many commonly used causal estimators, regressors (`base learners' henceforth) and metrics applied to four well-known causal inference benchmark datasets. Our results show that hyperparameter tuning increased the probability of reaching state-of-the-art performance in average ($65\% {\rightarrow} 81\%$) and individualised ($50\% {\rightarrow} 57\%$) effect estimation with only commonly used estimators. We also show that the performance of standard metrics can be inconsistent across different scenarios. Our findings highlight the need for further research to establish whether metrics uniformly capable of state-of-the-art performance in causal model evaluation can be found.</p></details> | <details><summary>Subst...</summary><p>Substantially revised version. 18 pages of main content (33 pages in total), 4 main figures (11 in total)</p></details> |
| **[Highly Efficient and Effective LLMs with Multi-Boolean Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22811v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight binarization has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce the complexity of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches fall into post-training binarization, which is simple but causes severe performance loss, and training-aware methods, which depend on full-precision latent weights, adding complexity and limiting efficiency. We propose a novel framework that represents LLMs with multi-kernel Boolean parameters and, for the first time, enables direct finetuning LMMs in the Boolean domain, eliminating the need for latent weights. This enhances representational capacity and dramatically reduces complexity during both finetuning and inference. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs show our method outperforms recent ultra low-bit quantization and binarization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14837v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures; Accepted to ACL 2025</p></details> |

A Multi-Institutional Study of Student Views on Generative AI in Computing Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03107v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Artificial Intelligence, in particular Generative AI, has become more widespread among educational institutions. Opinions vary widely on whether integrating AI into classrooms is the way forward or if it is detrimental to the quality of education. Increasingly, research studies are giving us more insight into the consequences of using AI tools in learning and teaching. Studies have shown how, when, and why students use AI tools. Because developments regarding the technology and its use are moving fast, we need frequent, ongoing, and more fine-grained investigation. One aspect that we do not know much about yet is how students use and think about AI across \textit{different types of education}. In this paper, we present the results of a multi-institutional survey with responses from 410 students enrolled in the computing programs of 23 educational institutions, representing high schools, colleges, and research universities. We found distinct usage patterns across the three educational institution types. Students from all types express excitement, optimism, and gratitude toward GenAI. Students in higher education more often report worry and skepticism, while high school students report greater trust and fewer negative feelings. Additionally, the AI hype has had a minimal influence, positive or negative, on high school students' decision to pursue computing. Our study contributes to a better understanding of inter-institutional differences in AI usage and perception and can help educators and students better prepare for future challenges related to AI in computing education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Koli Calling '25</p></details> |
| **[Bootstrap Learning for Combinatorial Graph Alignment with Sequential GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03086v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference, this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing \underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with \underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer, filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ACM MM'25</p></details> |
| **[Query-Level Uncertainty in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09669v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is important for Large Language Models (LLMs) to be aware of the boundary of their knowledge, distinguishing queries they can confidently answer from those that lie beyond their capabilities. Such awareness enables models to perform adaptive inference, such as invoking retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), engaging in slow and deep thinking, or abstaining from answering when appropriate. These mechanisms are key to developing efficient and trustworthy AI. In this work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level Uncertainty, which estimates if a model is capable of answering a given query before generating any tokens, thus avoiding the generation cost. To this end, we propose a novel, training-free method called Internal Confidence, which leverages self-evaluations across layers and tokens to provide a reliable signal of uncertainty. Empirical studies on both factual question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our Internal Confidence outperforms several baselines in quality of confidence while being computationally cheaper. Furthermore, we demonstrate its benefits in adaptive inference settings, showing that for RAG and model cascading it reduces inference costs while preserving overall performance.</p></details> | Under Review |

We introduce FR-LUX (Friction-aware, Regime-conditioned Learning under eXecution costs), a reinforcement learning framework that learns after-cost trading policies and remains robust across volatility-liquidity regimes. FR-LUX integrates three ingredients: (i) a microstructure-consistent execution model combining proportional and impact costs, directly embedded in the reward; (ii) a trade-space trust region that constrains changes in inventory flow rather than logits, yielding stable low-turnover updates; and (iii) explicit regime conditioning so the policy specializes to LL/LH/HL/HH states without fragmenting the data. On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels with multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with narrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance slope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a given turnover budget. Pairwise scenario-level improvements are strictly positive and remain statistically significant after multiple-testing corrections. We provide formal guarantees on optimality under convex frictions, monotonic improvement under a KL trust region, long-run turnover bounds and induced inaction bands due to proportional costs, positive value advantage for regime-conditioned policies, and robustness to cost misspecification. The methodology is implementable: costs are calibrated from standard liquidity proxies, scenario-level inference avoids pseudo-replication, and all figures and tables are reproducible from released artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, includes theoretical guarantees and empirical evaluation, submitted to AI/ML in Finance track</p></details> |
| **[Flip Distribution Alignment VAE for Multi-Phase MRI Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02970v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis quality.

This paper leverages a real-world, multi-operator drive-test dataset of 30,925 labelled records collected within a 2 km area around Sunway City to investigate sequence-based deep learning approaches for handover detection and avoidance. We formulate handover prediction as a sequence problem and evaluate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformer architectures under Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)-only and all-feature settings. The integration of multi-dimensional features significantly enhanced handover performance in dense urban cellular networks. The proposed GRU-based model achieved a remarkable 98% reduction in ping-pong handovers, alongside a 46.25% decrease in unnecessary handovers, outperforming the baseline RSRP-only approach which yielded a 22.19% reduction. Furthermore, the model demonstrated a 46% improvement in Time of Stay (ToS), indicating more stable user connections. With an inference time of just 0.91 seconds, the solution proves highly efficient and well-suited for real-time edge deployment scenarios. Compared to the conventional 3GPP A3 algorithm, these improvements demonstrate significant gains in mobility robustness and user Quality of Experience (QoE) improvement. The dataset is released to foster reproducibility and further research in intelligent mobility management for 5G and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |

Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both episode-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JingMog/THOR.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow matching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of structural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically, ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints, ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025 main</p></details> |

These accelerators are costly and it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations. We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy. Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time, enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload. We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only 0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and overall performance benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. 14 figures.

Recently, the advent of large-scale genomics and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted the necessity for phylogenetic software to handle large datasets. While significant efforts have focused on scaling optimisation algorithms, visualization, and lineage identification, an emerging body of research has been dedicated to efficient representations of data for genomes and phylogenetic trees. Compared to the traditional Newick format which represents trees using strings of nested parentheses, modern tree representations utilize integer vectors to define the tree topology traversal. This approach offers several advantages, including easier manipulation, increased memory efficiency, and applicability to machine learning. Here, we present the latest release of phylo2vec (or Phylo2Vec), a high-performance software package for encoding, manipulating, and analysing binary phylogenetic trees. At its core, the package is based on the phylo2vec representation of binary trees, and is designed to enable fast sampling and tree comparison. This release features a core implementation in Rust for improved performance and memory efficiency, with wrappers in R and Python (superseding the original release), making it accessible to a broad audience in the bioinformatics community.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.</p></details> | 13 pages,5 figures |

We study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated, we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments.

However, their performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction. This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood (measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks.</p></details> | Under Review |

Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.

| **[O(1) Insertion for Random Walk d-ary Cuckoo Hashing up to the Load Threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14394v5)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing algorithm was defined by Fotakis, Pagh, Sanders, and Spirakis to generalize and improve upon the standard cuckoo hashing algorithm of Pagh and Rodler. Random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing has low space overhead, guaranteed fast access, and fast in practice insertion time. In this paper, we give a theoretical insertion time bound for this algorithm. More precisely, for every $d\ge 3$ hashes, let $c_d^*$ be the sharp threshold for the load factor at which a valid assignment of $cm$ objects to a hash table of size $m$ likely exists. We show that for any $d\ge 4$ hashes and load factor $c<c_d^*$, the expectation of the random walk insertion time is $O(1)$, that is, a constant depending only on $d$ and $c$ but not $m$.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Le...</summary><p>In Lemma 4.3 of Section 4 (in the most recent version), there is an error in assuming the independence of events that occur over overlapping time intervals. Therefore, the proof of Theorem 1.1 is not correct as written. We are continuing to work on resolving this issue, with the goal of recovering a proof of Theorem 1.1</p></details> |
| **[VisitHGNN: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks for Modeling Point-of-Interest Visit Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02702v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how urban residents travel between neighborhoods and destinations is critical for transportation planning, mobility management, and public health. By mining historical origin-to-destination flow patterns with spatial, temporal, and functional relations among urban places, we estimate probabilities of visits from neighborhoods to specific destinations. These probabilities capture neighborhood-level contributions to citywide vehicular and foot traffic, supporting demand estimation, accessibility assessment, and multimodal planning. Particularly, we introduce VisitHGNN, a heterogeneous, relation-specific graph neural network designed to predict visit probabilities at individual Points of interest (POIs). POIs are characterized using numerical, JSON-derived, and textual attributes, augmented with fixed summaries of POI--POI spatial proximity, temporal co-activity, and brand affinity, while census block groups (CBGs) are described with 72 socio-demographic variables. CBGs are connected via spatial adjacency, and POIs and CBGs are linked through distance-annotated cross-type edges. Inference is constrained to a distance-based candidate set of plausible origin CBGs, and training minimizes a masked Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to yield probability distribution across the candidate set. Using weekly mobility data from Fulton County, Georgia, USA, VisitHGNN achieves strong predictive performance with mean KL divergence of 0.287, MAE of 0.008, Top-1 accuracy of 0.853, and R-square of 0.892, substantially outperforming pairwise MLP and distance-only baselines, and aligning closely with empirical visitation patterns (NDCG@50 = 0.966); Recall@5 = 0.611). The resulting distributions closely mirror observed travel behavior with high fidelity, highlighting the model's potential for decision support in urban planning, transportation policy, mobility system design, and public health.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Heavily Right Strategy for Statistical Inference with Dependent Studies in Any Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01065v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We leverage recent advances in heavy-tail approximations for global hypothesis testing with dependent studies to construct approximate confidence regions without modeling or estimating their dependence structures. A non-rejection region is a confidence region but it may not be convex. Convexity is appealing because it ensures any one-dimensional linear projection of the region is a confidence interval, easy to compute and interpret. We show why convexity fails for nearly all heavy-tail combination tests proposed in recent years, including the influential Cauchy combination test. These insights motivate a \textit{heavily right} strategy: truncating the left half of the Cauchy distribution to obtain the Half-Cauchy combination test. The harmonic mean test also corresponds to a heavily right distribution with a Cauchy-like tail, namely a Pareto distribution with unit power. We prove that both approaches guarantee convexity when individual studies are summarized by Hotelling $T^2$ or $\chi^{2}$ statistics (regardless of the validity of this summary) and provide efficient, \textit{exact} algorithms for implementation. Applying these methods, we develop a divide-and-combine strategy for mean estimation in any dimension and construct simultaneous confidence intervals in a network meta-analysis for treatment effect comparisons across multiple clinical trials. We also present many open problems and conclude with epistemic reflections.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 72 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[SBP-YOLO:A Lightweight Real-Time Model for Detecting Speed Bumps and Potholes toward Intelligent Vehicle Suspension Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01339v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speed bumps and potholes are the most common road anomalies, significantly affecting ride comfort and vehicle stability. Preview-based suspension control mitigates their impact by detecting such irregularities in advance and adjusting suspension parameters proactively. Accurate and real-time detection is essential, but embedded deployment is constrained by limited computational resources and the small size of targets in input images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes SBP-YOLO, an efficient detection framework for speed bumps and potholes in embedded systems. Built upon YOLOv11n, it integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules in the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. A P2-level branch improves small-object detection, and a lightweight and efficient detection head (LEDH) maintains accuracy with minimal overhead. A hybrid training strategy further enhances robustness under varying road and environmental conditions, combining NWD loss, BCKD knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based augmentation. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8%. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, yielding a 12.4% speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results demonstrate the framework's suitability for fast, low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.</p></details> | 14pages,11figures |
| **[Mind the Gap: Linguistic Divergence and Adaptation Strategies in Human-LLM Assistant vs. Human-Human Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02645v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved LLM-user interaction experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The Second Workshop on Generative AI for E-commerce (GenAIECommerce '25), held September 22, 2025, in Prague, Czech Republic</p></details> |

| **[CIE: Controlling Language Model Text Generations Using Continuous Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13448v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning language models with user intent is becoming increasingly relevant to enhance user experience. This calls for designing methods that can allow users to control the properties of the language that LMs generate. For example, controlling the length of the generation, the complexity of the language that gets chosen, the sentiment, tone, etc. Most existing work attempts to integrate users' control by conditioning LM generations on natural language prompts or discrete control signals, which are often brittle and hard to scale. In this work, we are interested in \textit{continuous} control signals, ones that exist along a spectrum that can't easily be captured in a natural language prompt or via existing techniques in conditional generation. Through a case study in controlling the precise response-length of generations produced by LMs, we demonstrate how after fine-tuning, behaviors of language models can be controlled via continuous signals -- as vectors that are interpolated between a "low" and a "high" token embedding. Our method more reliably exerts response-length control than in-context learning methods or fine-tuning methods that represent the control signal as a discrete signal. Our full open-sourced code and datasets are available at https://github.com/vsamuel2003/CIE.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Mean Flows for One-step Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13447v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a principled and effective framework for one-step generative modeling. We introduce the notion of average velocity to characterize flow fields, in contrast to instantaneous velocity modeled by Flow Matching methods. A well-defined identity between average and instantaneous velocities is derived and used to guide neural network training. Our method, termed the MeanFlow model, is self-contained and requires no pre-training, distillation, or curriculum learning. MeanFlow demonstrates strong empirical performance: it achieves an FID of 3.43 with a single function evaluation (1-NFE) on ImageNet 256x256 trained from scratch, significantly outperforming previous state-of-the-art one-step diffusion/flow models. Our study substantially narrows the gap between one-step diffusion/flow models and their multi-step predecessors, and we hope it will motivate future research to revisit the foundations of these powerful models.</p></details> | Tech report |
| **[Unlocking Non-Invasive Brain-to-Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13446v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite major advances in surgical brain-to-text (B2T), i.e. transcribing speech from invasive brain recordings, non-invasive alternatives have yet to surpass even chance on standard metrics. This remains a barrier to building a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of restoring communication in paralysed individuals without surgery. Here, we present the first non-invasive B2T result that significantly exceeds these critical baselines, raising BLEU by $1.4\mathrm{-}2.6\times$ over prior work. This result is driven by three contributions: (1) we extend recent word-classification models with LLM-based rescoring, transforming single-word predictors into closed-vocabulary B2T systems; (2) we introduce a predictive in-filling approach to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, substantially expanding the effective vocabulary; and (3) we demonstrate, for the first time, how to scale non-invasive B2T models across datasets, unlocking deep learning at scale and improving accuracy by $2.1\mathrm{-}2.3\times$. Through these contributions, we offer new insights into the roles of data quality and vocabulary size. Together, our results remove a major obstacle to realising practical non-invasive B2T systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 10 tables.

| **[Trust, But Verify: A Self-Verification Approach to Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13445v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show great promise in complex reasoning, with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) being a key enhancement strategy. However, a prevalent issue is ``superficial self-reflection'', where models fail to robustly verify their own outputs. We introduce RISE (Reinforcing Reasoning with Self-Verification), a novel online RL framework designed to tackle this. RISE explicitly and simultaneously trains an LLM to improve both its problem-solving and self-verification abilities within a single, integrated RL process. The core mechanism involves leveraging verifiable rewards from an outcome verifier to provide on-the-fly feedback for both solution generation and self-verification tasks. In each iteration, the model generates solutions, then critiques its own on-policy generated solutions, with both trajectories contributing to the policy update. Extensive experiments on diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that RISE consistently improves model's problem-solving accuracy while concurrently fostering strong self-verification skills. Our analyses highlight the advantages of online verification and the benefits of increased verification compute. Additionally, RISE models exhibit more frequent and accurate self-verification behaviors during reasoning. These advantages reinforce RISE as a flexible and effective path towards developing more robust and self-aware reasoners.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code available at https://github.com/xyliu-cs/RISE</p></details> |
| **[Recollection from Pensieve: Novel View Synthesis via Learning from Uncalibrated Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13440v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information. The code is available at https://github.com/Dwawayu/Pensieve.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[VTBench: Evaluating Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13439v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have recently shown strong performance in image generation, where a critical component is the visual tokenizer (VT) that maps continuous pixel inputs to discrete token sequences. The quality of the VT largely defines the upper bound of AR model performance. However, current discrete VTs fall significantly behind continuous variational autoencoders (VAEs), leading to degraded image reconstructions and poor preservation of details and text. Existing benchmarks focus on end-to-end generation quality, without isolating VT performance. To address this gap, we introduce VTBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates VTs across three core tasks: Image Reconstruction, Detail Preservation, and Text Preservation, and covers a diverse range of evaluation scenarios. We systematically assess state-of-the-art VTs using a set of metrics to evaluate the quality of reconstructed images. Our findings reveal that continuous VAEs produce superior visual representations compared to discrete VTs, particularly in retaining spatial structure and semantic detail. In contrast, the degraded representations produced by discrete VTs often lead to distorted reconstructions, loss of fine-grained textures, and failures in preserving text and object integrity. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on GPT-4o image generation and discuss its potential AR nature, offering new insights into the role of visual tokenization. We release our benchmark and codebase publicly to support further research and call on the community to develop strong, general-purpose open-source VTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[FinePhys: Fine-grained Human Action Generation by Explicitly Incorporating Physical Laws for Effective Skeletal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13437v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in video generation, synthesizing physically plausible human actions remains a persistent challenge, particularly in modeling fine-grained semantics and complex temporal dynamics. For instance, generating gymnastics routines such as "switch leap with 0.5 turn" poses substantial difficulties for current methods, often yielding unsatisfactory results. To bridge this gap, we propose FinePhys, a Fine-grained human action generation framework that incorporates Physics to obtain effective skeletal guidance. Specifically, FinePhys first estimates 2D poses in an online manner and then performs 2D-to-3D dimension lifting via in-context learning. To mitigate the instability and limited interpretability of purely data-driven 3D poses, we further introduce a physics-based motion re-estimation module governed by Euler-Lagrange equations, calculating joint accelerations via bidirectional temporal updating. The physically predicted 3D poses are then fused with data-driven ones, offering multi-scale 2D heatmap guidance for the diffusion process. Evaluated on three fine-grained action subsets from FineGym (FX-JUMP, FX-TURN, and FX-SALTO), FinePhys significantly outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive qualitative results further demonstrate FinePhys's ability to generate more natural and plausible fine-grained human actions.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Pre-Training Estimators for Structural Models: Application to Consumer Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00526v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore pretraining estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator is "pretrained" in the sense that the bulk of the computational cost and researcher effort occur during the construction of the estimator. Subsequent applications of the estimator to different datasets require little computational cost or researcher effort. The estimation leverages a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. As an initial trial, this paper builds a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model that is known to be difficult to estimate. We evaluate the pretrained estimator on 12 real datasets. The estimation takes seconds to run and shows high accuracy. We provide the estimator at pnnehome.github.io. More generally, pretrained, off-the-shelf estimators can make structural models more accessible to researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Originally posted on SSRN on June 7, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Greed is Good: A Unifying Perspective on Guided Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08006v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training-free guided generation is a widely used and powerful technique that allows the end user to exert further control over the generative process of flow/diffusion models. Generally speaking, two families of techniques have emerged for solving this problem for gradient-based guidance: namely, posterior guidance (i.e., guidance via projecting the current sample to the target distribution via the target prediction model) and end-to-end guidance (i.e., guidance by performing backpropagation throughout the entire ODE solve). In this work, we show that these two seemingly separate families can actually be unified by looking at posterior guidance as a greedy strategy of end-to-end guidance. We explore the theoretical connections between these two families and provide an in-depth theoretical of these two techniques relative to the continuous ideal gradients. Motivated by this analysis we then show a method for interpolating between these two families enabling a trade-off between compute and accuracy of the guidance gradients. We then validate this work on several inverse image problems and property-guided molecular generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised preprint with numerical experiments</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Single Pass, Looping Through Time: KG-IRAG with Iterative Knowledge Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14234v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has proven highly effective in enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks that require external knowledge. By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[G1: Bootstrapping Perception and Reasoning Abilities of Vision-Language Model via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13426v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many direct multimodal tasks but struggle to translate this prowess into effective decision-making within interactive, visually rich environments like games. This ``knowing-doing'' gap significantly limits their potential as autonomous agents, as leading VLMs often performing badly in simple games. To address this, we introduce VLM-Gym, a curated reinforcement learning (RL) environment featuring diverse visual games with unified interfaces and adjustable, compositional difficulty, specifically designed for scalable multi-game parallel training. Leveraging VLM-Gym, we train G0 models using pure RL-driven self-evolution, which demonstrate emergent perception and reasoning patterns. To further mitigate challenges arising from game diversity, we develop G1 models. G1 incorporates a perception-enhanced cold start prior to RL fine-tuning. Our resulting G1 models consistently surpass their teacher across all games and outperform leading proprietary models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking. Systematic analysis reveals an intriguing finding: perception and reasoning abilities mutually bootstrap each other throughout the RL training process. Source code including VLM-Gym and RL training are released at https://github.com/chenllliang/G1 to foster future research in advancing VLMs as capable interactive agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, code released at https://github.com/chenllliang/G1</p></details> |
| **[FEALLM: Advancing Facial Emotion Analysis in Multimodal Large Language Models with Emotional Synergy and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13419v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial Emotion Analysis (FEA) plays a crucial role in visual affective computing, aiming to infer a person's emotional state based on facial data. Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs) that provide detailed emotional insights. However, traditional methods often struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and reasoning abilities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various visual tasks, while they still face significant challenges in FEA due to the lack of specialized datasets and their inability to capture the intricate relationships between FEs and AUs. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FEA Instruction Dataset that provides accurate and aligned FE and AU descriptions and establishes causal reasoning relationships between them, followed by constructing a new benchmark, FEABench. Moreover, we propose FEALLM, a novel MLLM architecture designed to capture more detailed facial information, enhancing its capability in FEA tasks. Our model demonstrates strong performance on FEABench and impressive generalization capability through zero-shot evaluation on various datasets, including RAF-DB, AffectNet, BP4D, and DISFA, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in FEA tasks. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/953206211/FEALLM.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

To address this, we present Granary, a large-scale collection of speech datasets for recognition and translation across 25 European languages. This is the first open-source effort at this scale for both transcription and translation. We enhance data quality using a pseudo-labeling pipeline with segmentation, two-pass inference, hallucination filtering, and punctuation restoration. We further generate translation pairs from pseudo-labeled transcriptions using EuroLLM, followed by a data filtration pipeline. Designed for efficiency, our pipeline processes vast amount of data within hours. We assess models trained on processed data by comparing their performance on previously curated datasets for both high- and low-resource languages. Our findings show that these models achieve similar performance using approx. 50% less data.

| **[Cayley Graph Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03424v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spite of the plethora of success stories with graph neural networks (GNNs) on modelling graph-structured data, they are notoriously vulnerable to over-squashing, whereby tasks necessitate the mixing of information between distance pairs of nodes. To address this problem, prior work suggests rewiring the graph structure to improve information flow. Alternatively, a significant body of research has dedicated itself to discovering and precomputing bottleneck-free graph structures to ameliorate over-squashing. One well regarded family of bottleneck-free graphs within the mathematical community are expander graphs, with prior work -- Expander Graph Propagation (EGP) -- proposing the use of a well-known expander graph family -- the Cayley graphs of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ special linear group -- as a computational template for GNNs. However, in EGP the computational graphs used are truncated to align with a given input graph. In this work, we show that truncation is detrimental to the coveted expansion properties. Instead, we propose CGP, a method to propagate information over a complete Cayley graph structure, thereby ensuring it is bottleneck-free to better alleviate over-squashing. Our empirical evidence across several real-world datasets not only shows that CGP recovers significant improvements as compared to EGP, but it is also akin to or outperforms computationally complex graph rewiring techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Third Learning on Graphs Conference (LoG 2024), PMLR 269. 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Minimum Description Length Approach to Regularization in Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13398v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art neural networks can be trained to become remarkable solutions to many problems. But while these architectures can express symbolic, perfect solutions, trained models often arrive at approximations instead. We show that the choice of regularization method plays a crucial role: when trained on formal languages with standard regularization ($L_1$, $L_2$, or none), expressive architectures not only fail to converge to correct solutions but are actively pushed away from perfect initializations. In contrast, applying the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to balance model complexity with data fit provides a theoretically grounded regularization method. Using MDL, perfect solutions are selected over approximations, independently of the optimization algorithm. We propose that unlike existing regularization techniques, MDL introduces the appropriate inductive bias to effectively counteract overfitting and promote generalization.</p></details> | 9 pages |

One direction gives a tight lower bound in terms of individual vertex degrees, extending work of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner and Zhao which bounds the partition function. The other bounds the variance of the size of an independent set drawn from the model, which is strictly stronger than bounding the occupancy fraction. In the setting of triangle-free graphs, we make progress on a recent conjecture of Buys, van den Heuvel and Kang on extensions of Shearer's classic bounds on the independence number to the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model. Sufficiently strong lower bounds on both the expectation and the variance in triangle-free graphs have the potential to improve the known bounds on the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3,t)$, and to shed light on the algorithmic barrier one observes for independent sets in sparse random graphs.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Advancing Generalization Across a Variety of Abstract Visual Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13391v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abstract visual reasoning (AVR) domain presents a diverse suite of analogy-based tasks devoted to studying model generalization. Recent years have brought dynamic progress in the field, particularly in i.i.d. scenarios, in which models are trained and evaluated on the same data distributions. Nevertheless, o.o.d. setups that assess model generalization to new test distributions remain challenging even for the most recent models. To advance generalization in AVR tasks, we present the Pathways of Normalized Group Convolution model (PoNG), a novel neural architecture that features group convolution, normalization, and a parallel design. We consider a wide set of AVR benchmarks, including Raven's Progressive Matrices and visual analogy problems with both synthetic and real-world images. The experiments demonstrate strong generalization capabilities of the proposed model, which in several settings outperforms the existing literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[MGPBD: A Multigrid Accelerated Global XPBD Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13390v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel Unsmoothed Aggregation (UA) Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) method combined with Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) to overcome the limitations of Extended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD) in high-resolution and high-stiffness simulations. While XPBD excels in simulating deformable objects due to its speed and simplicity, its nonlinear Gauss-Seidel (GS) solver often struggles with low-frequency errors, leading to instability and stalling issues, especially in high-resolution, high-stiffness simulations. Our multigrid approach addresses these issues efficiently by leveraging AMG. To reduce the computational overhead of traditional AMG, where prolongator construction can consume up to two-thirds of the runtime, we propose a lazy setup strategy that reuses prolongators across iterations based on matrix structure and physical significance. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified method for constructing near-kernel components by applying a few sweeps of iterative methods to the homogeneous equation, achieving convergence rates comparable to adaptive smoothed aggregation (adaptive-SA) at a lower computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves convergence rates and numerical stability, enabling efficient and stable high-resolution simulations of deformable objects.</p></details> | SIGGRAPH 2025 |

These models are typically optimized for narrow objectives, limiting their generalizability to broader downstream tasks. Moreover, their scalar outputs are difficult to interpret without contextual reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce R3, a novel reward modeling framework that is rubric-agnostic, generalizable across evaluation dimensions, and provides interpretable, reasoned score assignments. R3 enables more transparent and flexible evaluation of language models, supporting robust alignment with diverse human values and use cases.

However, we argue that effective SMoE training remains challenging because of the suboptimal routing process where experts that perform computation do not directly contribute to the routing process. In this work, we propose competition, a novel mechanism to route tokens to experts with the highest neural response. Theoretically, we show that the competition mechanism enjoys a better sample efficiency than the traditional softmax routing. Furthermore, we develop CompeteSMoE, a simple yet effective algorithm to train large language models by deploying a router to learn the competition policy, thus enjoying strong performances at a low training overhead. Our extensive empirical evaluations on both the visual instruction tuning and language pre-training tasks demonstrate the efficacy, robustness, and scalability of CompeteSMoE compared to state-of-the-art SMoE strategies.

Although recent large language model (LLM)-based task planners achieve amazing performance, they assume that human instructions are clear and straightforward. However, real-world users are not experts, and their instructions to robots often contain significant vagueness. Linguists suggest that such vagueness frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more prevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we propose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench), where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%. We also observe that most failure cases stem from missing objects in planners. To mitigate the REs issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach: task-oriented context cognition, which generates clear instructions for robots, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to aware prompt and chains of thought. This work contributes to the research community of human-robot interaction (HRI) by making robot task planning more practical, particularly for non-expert users, e.g., the elderly and children.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Minimum-Excess-Work Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13375v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.</p></details> | 30 pages, 18 figures |

While ODEs offer interpretability and simplicity, SDEs incorporate randomness, providing robustness to noise and model misspecifications. Recent research highlights the statistical advantages of SDEs, such as improved parameter identifiability and stability under perturbations. This paper investigates the robustness of parameter estimation in SDEs versus ODEs under three types of model misspecifications: unrecognized noise sources, external perturbations, and simplified models. Furthermore, the effect of missing data is explored. Through simulations and an analysis of Danish COVID-19 data, we demonstrate that SDEs yield more stable and reliable parameter estimates, making them a strong alternative to traditional ODE modeling in the presence of uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added acknowledgements and changed the formatting of most of the images</p></details> |

While such networks are traditionally constructed using embeddings from encoder-based models or static vectors, embeddings from decoder-only large language models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Unlike encoder models, LLMs are trained with a next-token prediction objective, which does not directly encode the meaning of the current token. In this paper, we construct lexico-semantic networks from the input embeddings of LLMs with varying parameter scales and conduct a comparative analysis of their global and local structures. Our results show that these networks exhibit small-world properties, characterized by high clustering and short path lengths. Moreover, larger LLMs yield more intricate networks with less small-world effects and longer paths, reflecting richer semantic structures and relations. We further validate our approach through analyses of common conceptual pairs, structured lexical relations derived from WordNet, and a cross-lingual semantic network for qualitative words.</p></details> | Paper under review |

This remains a barrier to building a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) capable of restoring communication in paralysed individuals without surgery. Here, we present the first non-invasive B2T result that significantly exceeds these critical baselines, raising BLEU by $1.4\mathrm{-}2.6\times$ over prior work. This result is driven by three contributions: (1) we extend recent word-classification models with LLM-based rescoring, transforming single-word predictors into closed-vocabulary B2T systems; (2) we introduce a predictive in-filling approach to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, substantially expanding the effective vocabulary; and (3) we demonstrate, for the first time, how to scale non-invasive B2T models across datasets, unlocking deep learning at scale and improving accuracy by $2.1\mathrm{-}2.3\times$. Through these contributions, we offer new insights into the roles of data quality and vocabulary size. Together, our results remove a major obstacle to realising practical non-invasive B2T systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 10 tables.

To this end, the IG Parser employs a distinctive syntax that ensures rigorous encoding of natural language, while automating the transformation into various formats that support the downstream analysis using diverse analytical techniques. The conceptual core of the IG Parser is an associated syntax, IG Script, that operationalizes the conceptual foundations of the Institutional Grammar, and more specifically Institutional Grammar 2.0, an analytical paradigm for institutional analysis. This article presents the IG Parser, including its conceptual foundations, syntactic specification of IG Script, alongside architectural principles. This introduction is augmented with selective illustrative examples that highlight the use and benefit associated with the tool.</p></details> | 24 pages |

We present an empirically evaluated practice exam system that integrates AI generated feedback with targeted textbook references, deployed in a large introductory biology course. Our system encourages metacognitive behavior by asking students to explain their answers and declare their confidence. It uses OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate personalized feedback based on this information, while directing them to relevant textbook sections. Through interaction logs from consenting participants across three midterms (541, 342, and 413 students respectively), totaling 28,313 question-student interactions across 146 learning objectives, along with 279 surveys and 23 interviews, we examined the system's impact on learning outcomes and engagement. Across all midterms, feedback types showed no statistically significant performance differences, though some trends suggested potential benefits. The most substantial impact came from the required confidence ratings and explanations, which students reported transferring to their actual exam strategies. About 40 percent of students engaged with textbook references when prompted by feedback -- far higher than traditional reading rates. Survey data revealed high satisfaction (mean rating 4.1 of 5), with 82.1 percent reporting increased confidence on practiced midterm topics, and 73.4 percent indicating they could recall and apply specific concepts. Our findings suggest that embedding structured reflection requirements may be more impactful than sophisticated feedback mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, to appear in Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM Conference on Learning @ Scale (L@S 2025), July 2025, Palermo, Italy</p></details> |

Yet, the conditions of when and how algorithms can effectively transfer to new tasks is poorly characterized. We introduce a geometric characterization of transfer in Hilbert spaces and define three types of inductive transfer: interpolation within the convex hull, extrapolation to the linear span, and extrapolation outside the span. We propose a method grounded in the theory of function encoders to achieve all three types of transfer. Specifically, we introduce a novel training scheme for function encoders using least-squares optimization, prove a universal approximation theorem for function encoders, and provide a comprehensive comparison with existing approaches such as transformers and meta-learning on four diverse benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that the function encoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark tasks and on all three types of transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final submission ICML 2025</p></details> |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> |

We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</p></details> | 28 pages |

However, existing techniques mainly focus on high-fidelity reconstruction, requiring many bits for compression. This paper proposes a "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model" (DDPM) architecture for point cloud compression (DDPM-PCC) at low bit-rates. A PointNet encoder produces the condition vector for the generation, which is then quantized via a learnable vector quantizer. This configuration allows to achieve a low bitrates while preserving quality. Experiments on ShapeNet and ModelNet40 show improved rate-distortion at low rates compared to standardized and state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[DD-Ranking: Rethinking the Evaluation of Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13300v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, dataset distillation has provided a reliable solution for data compression, where models trained on the resulting smaller synthetic datasets achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original datasets. To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms. However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we found that the proposed method can improve out-of-distribution performance compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is taking place in the inner workings of the model. We release the code used to run our experiments.</p></details> | ACL Findings 2025 |
| **[Computer Vision Models Show Human-Like Sensitivity to Geometric and Topological Concepts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13281v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid improvement of machine learning (ML) models, cognitive scientists are increasingly asking about their alignment with how humans think. Here, we ask this question for computer vision models and human sensitivity to geometric and topological (GT) concepts. Under the core knowledge account, these concepts are innate and supported by dedicated neural circuitry. In this work, we investigate an alternative explanation, that GT concepts are learned ``for free'' through everyday interaction with the environment. We do so using computer visions models, which are trained on large image datasets. We build on prior studies to investigate the overall performance and human alignment of three classes of models -- convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformer-based models, and vision-language models -- on an odd-one-out task testing 43 GT concepts spanning seven classes. Transformer-based models achieve the highest overall accuracy, surpassing that of young children. They also show strong alignment with children's performance, finding the same classes of concepts easy vs. difficult. By contrast, vision-language models underperform their vision-only counterparts and deviate further from human profiles, indicating that na\"ive multimodality might compromise abstract geometric sensitivity. These findings support the use of computer vision models to evaluate the sufficiency of the learning account for explaining human sensitivity to GT concepts, while also suggesting that integrating linguistic and visual representations might have unpredicted deleterious consequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, CosSci 2025</p></details> |

We hypothesize that this design choice may limit models in learning comprehensive and compositional representations from visual data. This paper explores the notion of providing semantically-meaningful visual tokens to transformer encoders within a vision-language pre-training framework. Leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and scene-graph models, we extract representations of instance segmentation masks (referred to as tangible tokens) and relationships and actions (referred to as intangible tokens). Subsequently, we pre-train a vision-side transformer by incorporating these newly extracted tokens and aligning the resultant embeddings with caption embeddings from a text-side encoder. To capture the structural and semantic relationships among visual tokens, we introduce additive attention weights, which are used to compute self-attention scores. Our experiments on COCO demonstrate notable improvements over ViTs in learned representation quality across text-to-image (+47%) and image-to-text retrieval (+44%) tasks. Furthermore, we showcase the advantages on compositionality benchmarks such as ARO (+18%) and Winoground (+10%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR Workshops 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

In most medical fields, monocular endoscopes are employed, and the algorithms used are typically adaptations of those designed for external environments, resulting in 3D reconstructions with an unknown scale factor. For the first time, we propose a method to estimate the real metric scale of a 3D reconstruction from standard monocular endoscopic images without relying on application-specific learned priors. Our fully model-based approach leverages the near-light sources embedded in endoscopes, positioned at a small but nonzero baseline from the camera, in combination with the inverse-square law of light attenuation, to accurately recover the metric scale from scratch. This enables the transformation of any endoscope into a metric device, which is crucial for applications such as measuring polyps, stenosis, or assessing the extent of diseased tissue.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, to be published in MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Previous algorithms, including the ubiquitous Adam, operate at the so called adaptive edge of stability regime during training leading to rapid oscillations and slowed convergence of loss. However, VRAdam adds a higher order penalty on the learning rate based on the velocity such that the algorithm automatically slows down whenever weight updates become large. In practice, we observe that the effective dynamic learning rate shrinks in high-velocity regimes, damping oscillations and allowing for a more aggressive base step size when necessary without divergence. By combining this velocity-based regularizer for global damping with per-parameter scaling of Adam to create a hybrid optimizer, we demonstrate that VRAdam consistently exceeds the performance against standard optimizers including AdamW. We benchmark various tasks such as image classification, language modeling, image generation and generative modeling using diverse architectures and training methodologies including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transformers, and GFlowNets.</p></details> | <details><summary>L.

In computer vision, this translates into a classification problem, where knowledge from seen categories is transferred to unseen categories by exploiting the relationships between visual features and available semantic information, such as text corpora or manual annotations. However, learning this joint distribution is costly and requires one-to-one training with corresponding semantic information. We present a reversed conditional Diffusion-based model (RevCD) that mitigates this issue by generating semantic features synthesized from visual inputs by leveraging Diffusion models' conditional mechanisms. Our RevCD model consists of a cross Hadamard-Addition embedding of a sinusoidal time schedule and a multi-headed visual transformer for attention-guided embeddings. The proposed approach introduces three key innovations. First, we reverse the process of generating semantic space based on visual data, introducing a novel loss function that facilitates more efficient knowledge transfer. Second, we apply Diffusion models to zero-shot learning - a novel approach that exploits their strengths in capturing data complexity. Third, we demonstrate our model's performance through a comprehensive cross-dataset evaluation.

Typically, multiple-exposure LDR images are employed to capture a wider range of brightness levels in a scene, as a single LDR image cannot represent both the brightest and darkest regions simultaneously. While effective, this multiple-exposure HDR-NVS approach has significant limitations, including susceptibility to motion artifacts (e.g., ghosting and blurring), high capture and storage costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the single-exposure HDR-NVS problem, where only single exposure LDR images are available during training. We further introduce a novel approach, Mono-HDR-3D, featuring two dedicated modules formulated by the LDR image formation principles, one for converting LDR colors to HDR counterparts, and the other for transforming HDR images to LDR format so that unsupervised learning is enabled in a closed loop. Designed as a meta-algorithm, our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing NVS models. Extensive experiments show that Mono-HDR-3D significantly outperforms previous methods.

Recurrent neural approaches have observed a lot of renewed interest, including the extended long short-term memory (xLSTM) architecture, which reinvigorates the original LSTM.

This work proposes Audio xLSTM (AxLSTM), an approach for learning audio representations from masked spectrogram patches in a self-supervised setting.

Recently, the generative capabilities of diffusion models have been employed for perceptual image compression, such as in CDC. A major drawback of these diffusion-based methods is that, while producing impressive perceptual quality images they are dropping in fidelity/increasing the distortion to the original uncompressed images when compared with other traditional or learned image compression schemes aiming for fidelity. In this paper, we propose a hybrid compression scheme optimized for perceptual quality, extending the approach of the CDC model with a decoder network in order to reduce the impact on distortion metrics such as PSNR. After using the decoder network to generate an initial image, optimized for distortion, the latent conditioned diffusion model refines the reconstruction for perceptual quality by predicting the residual. On standard benchmarks, we achieve up to +2dB PSNR fidelity improvements while maintaining comparable LPIPS and FID perceptual scores when compared with CDC. Additionally, the approach is easily extensible to video compression, where we achieve similar results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AIM Workshop 2024 at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Parallel Layer Normalization for Universal Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13142v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal approximation theorem (UAT) is a fundamental theory for deep neural networks (DNNs), demonstrating their powerful representation capacity to represent and approximate any function. The analyses and proofs of UAT are based on traditional network with only linear and nonlinear activation functions, but omitting normalization layers, which are commonly employed to enhance the training of modern networks. This paper conducts research on UAT of DNNs with normalization layers for the first time. We theoretically prove that an infinitely wide network -- composed solely of parallel layer normalization (PLN) and linear layers -- has universal approximation capacity. Additionally, we investigate the minimum number of neurons required to approximate $L$-Lipchitz continuous functions, with a single hidden-layer network. We compare the approximation capacity of PLN with traditional activation functions in theory. Different from the traditional activation functions, we identify that PLN can act as both activation function and normalization in deep neural networks at the same time. We also find that PLN can improve the performance when replacing LN in transformer architectures, which reveals the potential of PLN used in neural architectures.</p></details> | 30 pages |

However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).</p></details> | 34 pages, 41 figures |

Specifically, we construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We formulate a prediction problem for the future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We construct an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, which are akin to the self-attention mechanism in classical transformers. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically.

Mixed Precision (MP) mitigates this tradeoff by varying the numerical precision across network layers. This study focuses on automatically selecting an optimal MP configuration within Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for inference. The first key contribution is a novel sensitivity metric derived from a first-order Taylor series expansion of the loss function as a function of quantization errors in weights and activations. This metric, based on the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the loss, is efficiently calculated per layer using high-precision forward and backward passes over a small calibration dataset. The metric is additive across layers, with low calibration memory overhead as weight optimization is unnecessary. The second contribution is an accurate hardware-aware method for predicting MP time gain by modeling it as additive for sequential sub-graphs. An algorithm partitions the model graph into sequential subgraphs, measuring time gain for each configuration using a few samples. After calibrating per-layer sensitivity and time gain, an Integer Programming (IP) problem is formulated to maximize time gain while keeping loss MSE below a set threshold. Memory gain and theoretical time gain based on Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations are also considered. Rigorous experiments on the Intel Gaudi 2 accelerator validate the approach on several Large Language Models (LLMs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling.

One large identified impact on this is the human capability to perform transformations and alignments, which is directly influenced by the point of view and the motion retargeting strategy. In modern teleoperation systems, motion retargeting is usually implemented through a one time calibration or switching modes. Complex tasks, like concatenated screwing, might be difficult, because the operator has to align (e.g. mirror) rotational and translational input commands. Recent research has shown, that the separation of translation and rotation leads to increased task performance. This work proposes a formal motion retargeting method, which separates translational and rotational input commands. This method is then included in a optimal control based trajectory planner and shown to work on a UR5e manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |

Here, we propose an interpretable speech foundation model approach to enhance the clinical applicability of such tools. We introduce a speech-level Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) to detect depression using long-duration speech instead of short segments, along with a novel interpretation method that reveals prediction-relevant acoustic features for clinician interpretation. Our experiments show the proposed model outperforms a segment-level AST, highlighting the impact of segment-level labelling noise and the advantage of leveraging longer speech duration for more reliable depression detection. Through interpretation, we observe our model identifies reduced loudness and F0 as relevant depression signals, aligning with documented clinical findings. This interpretability supports a responsible AI approach for speech-based depression detection, rendering such tools more clinically applicable.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.13476</p></details> |
| **[Generative Modeling of Random Fields from Limited Data via Constrained Latent Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13007v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models are promising tools for science and engineering, but their reliance on abundant, high-quality data limits applicability. We present a novel framework for generative modeling of random fields (probability distributions over continuous functions) that incorporates domain knowledge to supplement limited, sparse, and indirect data. The foundation of the approach is latent flow matching, where generative modeling occurs on compressed function representations in the latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Innovations include the adoption of a function decoder within the VAE and integration of physical/statistical constraints into the VAE training process. In this way, a latent function representation is learned that yields continuous random field samples satisfying domain-specific constraints when decoded, even in data-limited regimes. Efficacy is demonstrated on two challenging applications: wind velocity field reconstruction from sparse sensors and material property inference from a limited number of indirect measurements. Results show that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to unconstrained methods and enables effective inference with relatively small training datasets that is intractable without constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages plus references and appendices, 17 figures</p></details> |

Recent advances in interpretability research have inspired the emergence of activation editing (or steering) techniques, which modify the activations of specific model components. These methods, due to their extremely small parameter counts, show promise for small datasets. However, their performance is highly dependent on identifying the correct modules to edit and often lacks stability across different datasets. In this paper, we propose Joint Localization and Activation Editing (JoLA), a method that jointly learns (1) which heads in the Transformer to edit (2) whether the intervention should be additive, multiplicative, or both and (3) the intervention parameters themselves - the vectors applied as additive offsets or multiplicative scalings to the head output. Through evaluations on three benchmarks spanning commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding, and natural language generation, we demonstrate that JoLA consistently outperforms existing methods. The code for the method is released at https://github.com/wenlai-lavine/jola.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025.

| **[Optimal Formats for Weight Quantisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12988v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight quantisation is an essential technique for enabling efficient training and deployment of modern deep learning models. However, the recipe book of quantisation formats is large and the formats are often chosen empirically. In this paper, we propose a framework for systematic design and analysis of quantisation formats. By connecting the question of format design with the classical quantisation theory, we show that the strong practical performance of popular formats comes from their ability to represent values using variable-length codes. Framing the optimisation problem as minimising the KL divergence between the original and quantised model outputs, the objective is aligned with minimising the squared quantisation error of the model parameters. We therefore develop and evaluate squared-error-optimal formats for known distributions, observing significant improvement of variable-length codes over fixed-length codes. Uniform quantisation followed by lossless compression with a variable-length code is shown to be optimal. However, we find that commonly used block formats and sparse outlier formats also outperform fixed-length codes, implying they also exploit variable-length encoding. Finally, by using the relationship between the Fisher information and KL divergence, we derive the optimal allocation of bit-widths to individual parameter tensors across the model's layers, saving up to 0.25 bits per parameter when tested with direct-cast quantisation of language models.</p></details> | 35 pages, 32 figures |

Previous research has primarily explored how these models handle simple tasks like name copying or selection, and we extend this by investigating how these models perform recursive language structure reasoning defined by context-free grammars (CFGs). We introduce a family of synthetic CFGs that produce hierarchical rules, capable of generating lengthy sentences (e.g., hundreds of tokens) that are locally ambiguous and require dynamic programming to parse. Despite this complexity, we demonstrate that generative models like GPT can accurately learn and reason over CFG-defined hierarchies and generate sentences based on it. We explore the model's internals, revealing that its hidden states precisely capture the structure of CFGs, and its attention patterns resemble the information passing in a dynamic programming algorithm. This paper also presents several corollaries, including showing why absolute positional embeddings is inferior to relative and rotary embeddings; uniform attention alone is surprisingly effective (motivating our follow-up work on Canon layers); encoder-only models (e.g., BERT, DeBERTa) struggle with deep structure reasoning on CFGs compared to autoregressive models (e.g., GPT); and injecting structural or syntactic noise into pretraining data markedly improves robustness to corrupted language prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2 po...</summary><p>V2 polishes writing and adds Appendix G; V3 polishes writing and changes the title; V4 improves writing and adds Appendix H (more uniform attention results)</p></details> |

In this paper, we first give a general method to transform a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition to a minimal code violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give a construction of a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition from an arbitrary projective linear code. Hence an arbitrary projective linear code can be transformed to a minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give infinite many families of minimal codes violating the Ashikhamin-Barg condition. Weight distributions of constructed minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition in this paper are determined. Many minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition with their minimum weights close to the optimal or the best known minimum weights of linear codes are constructed in this paper. Moreover, many infinite families of self-orthogonal binary minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition are also given.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, minor error corrected</p></details> |

While significant progress has been made, there are still key challenges that need to be addressed. First, many approaches depend on a predefined degradation operator, making them ill-suited for complex or unknown degradations that deviate from standard analytical models. Second, many methods struggle to provide a stable guidance in the latent space and finally most methods convert latent representations back to the pixel domain for guidance at every sampling iteration, which significantly increases computational and memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a wavelet-inspired invertible neural network (INN) that simulates degradations through a forward transform and reconstructs lost details via the inverse transform. We further integrate this design into a latent diffusion pipeline through two proposed approaches: LatentINDIGO-PixelINN, which operates in the pixel domain, and LatentINDIGO-LatentINN, which stays fully in the latent space to reduce complexity. Both approaches alternate between updating intermediate latent variables under the guidance of our INN and refining the INN forward model to handle unknown degradations. In addition, a regularization step preserves the proximity of latent variables to the natural image manifold. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world low-quality images, and can be readily adapted to arbitrary output sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |
| **[Unified Cross-modal Translation of Score Images, Symbolic Music, and Performance Audio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12863v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music exists in various modalities, such as score images, symbolic scores, MIDI, and audio. Translations between each modality are established as core tasks of music information retrieval, such as automatic music transcription (audio-to-MIDI) and optical music recognition (score image to symbolic score). However, most past work on multimodal translation trains specialized models on individual translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified approach, where we train a general-purpose model on many translation tasks simultaneously. Two key factors make this unified approach viable: a new large-scale dataset and the tokenization of each modality. Firstly, we propose a new dataset that consists of more than 1,300 hours of paired audio-score image data collected from YouTube videos, which is an order of magnitude larger than any existing music modal translation datasets. Secondly, our unified tokenization framework discretizes score images, audio, MIDI, and MusicXML into a sequence of tokens, enabling a single encoder-decoder Transformer to tackle multiple cross-modal translation as one coherent sequence-to-sequence task. Experimental results confirm that our unified multitask model improves upon single-task baselines in several key areas, notably reducing the symbol error rate for optical music recognition from 24.58% to a state-of-the-art 13.67%, while similarly substantial improvements are observed across the other translation tasks. Notably, our approach achieves the first successful score-image-conditioned audio generation, marking a significant breakthrough in cross-modal music generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing (TASLPRO)</p></details> |

These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

| **[Accelerate TarFlow Sampling with GS-Jacobi Iteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12849v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation models have achieved widespread applications. As an instance, the TarFlow model combines the transformer architecture with Normalizing Flow models, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. However, due to the causal form of attention requiring sequential computation, TarFlow's sampling process is extremely slow. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a series of optimization strategies, TarFlow sampling can be greatly accelerated by using the Gauss-Seidel-Jacobi (abbreviated as GS-Jacobi) iteration method. Specifically, we find that blocks in the TarFlow model have varying importance: a small number of blocks play a major role in image generation tasks, while other blocks contribute relatively little; some blocks are sensitive to initial values and prone to numerical overflow, while others are relatively robust. Based on these two characteristics, we propose the Convergence Ranking Metric (CRM) and the Initial Guessing Metric (IGM): CRM is used to identify whether a TarFlow block is "simple" (converges in few iterations) or "tough" (requires more iterations); IGM is used to evaluate whether the initial value of the iteration is good. Experiments on four TarFlow models demonstrate that GS-Jacobi sampling can significantly enhance sampling efficiency while maintaining the quality of generated images (measured by FID), achieving speed-ups of 4.53x in Img128cond, 5.32x in AFHQ, 2.96x in Img64uncond, and 2.51x in Img64cond without degrading FID scores or sample quality.

However, such a powerful technique can be misused for spreading misinformation, infringing on copyrights, and evading content tracing. This motivates us to introduce the task of origin IDentification for text-guided Image-to-image Diffusion models (ID$^2$), aiming to retrieve the original image of a given translated query. A straightforward solution to ID$^2$ involves training a specialized deep embedding model to extract and compare features from both query and reference images. However, due to visual discrepancy across generations produced by different diffusion models, this similarity-based approach fails when training on images from one model and testing on those from another, limiting its effectiveness in real-world applications. To solve this challenge of the proposed ID$^2$ task, we contribute the first dataset and a theoretically guaranteed method, both emphasizing generalizability. The curated dataset, OriPID, contains abundant Origins and guided Prompts, which can be used to train and test potential IDentification models across various diffusion models. In the method section, we first prove the existence of a linear transformation that minimizes the distance between the pre-trained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) embeddings of generated samples and their origins. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that such a simple linear transformation can be generalized across different diffusion models. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves satisfying generalization performance, significantly surpassing similarity-based methods ($+31.6\%$ mAP), even those with generalization designs.

Large language models such as ChatGPT, with their vast internet-scale training data, offer transformative potential to address this gap. In this study, we used both qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate how well ChatGPT can address visualization design questions. First, we quantitatively compared the ChatGPT-generated responses with anonymous online Human replies to data visualization questions on the VisGuides user forum. Next, we conducted a qualitative user study examining the reactions and attitudes of practitioners toward ChatGPT as a visualization design assistant. Participants were asked to bring their visualizations and design questions and received feedback from both Human experts and ChatGPT in randomized order. Our findings from both studies underscore ChatGPT's strengths, particularly its ability to rapidly generate diverse design options, while also highlighting areas for improvement, such as nuanced contextual understanding and fluid interaction dynamics beyond the chat interface. Drawing on these insights, we discuss design considerations for future LLM-based design feedback systems.</p></details> | 34 pages, 4 figures |

By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

Scientifically, facial expressions (FEs) result from the coordinated movement of facial muscles, which can be decomposed into specific action units (AUs) that provide detailed emotional insights. However, traditional methods often struggle with limited interpretability, constrained generalization and reasoning abilities. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various visual tasks, while they still face significant challenges in FEA due to the lack of specialized datasets and their inability to capture the intricate relationships between FEs and AUs. To address these issues, we introduce a novel FEA Instruction Dataset that provides accurate and aligned FE and AU descriptions and establishes causal reasoning relationships between them, followed by constructing a new benchmark, FEABench. Moreover, we propose FEALLM, a novel MLLM architecture designed to capture more detailed facial information, enhancing its capability in FEA tasks. Our model demonstrates strong performance on FEABench and impressive generalization capability through zero-shot evaluation on various datasets, including RAF-DB, AffectNet, BP4D, and DISFA, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in FEA tasks.

Unfortunately, such communication overhead typically constitutes a significant portion of the total runtime, hampering the scalability of distributed training and inference for modern MoE models (consuming over $40\%$ runtime in large-scale training). In this paper, we first define collaborative communication to illustrate this intrinsic limitation, and then propose system- and algorithm-level innovations to reduce communication costs. Specifically, given a pair of experts co-activated by one token, we call them "collaborated", which comprises $2$ cases as intra- and inter-collaboration, depending on whether they are kept on the same device. Our pilot investigations reveal that augmenting the proportion of intra-collaboration can accelerate expert parallelism at scale. It motivates us to strategically optimize collaborative communication for accelerated MoE training and inference, dubbed Occult. Our designs are capable of either delivering exact results with reduced communication cost or controllably minimizing the cost with collaboration pruning, materialized by modified fine-tuning. Comprehensive experiments on various MoE-LLMs demonstrate that Occult can be faster than popular state-of-the-art inference or training frameworks (more than $1.5\times$ speed up across multiple tasks and models) with comparable or superior quality compared to the standard fine-tuning. Code is available at $\href{https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/Occult}{https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/Occult}$.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Understanding these internal mechanisms is critical - not only to move beyond surface-level performance, but also for model alignment and safety, where subtle misattributions of mental states may go undetected in generated outputs. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation of belief representations in LMs by probing models across different scales, training regimens, and prompts - using control tasks to rule out confounds. Our experiments provide evidence that both model size and fine-tuning substantially improve LMs' internal representations of others' beliefs, which are structured - not mere by-products of spurious correlations - yet brittle to prompt variations. Crucially, we show that these representations can be strengthened: targeted edits to model activations can correct wrong ToM inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability version: https://openreview.net/forum?id=yEwEVoH9Be</p></details> |

However, most SA designs rely heavily on the unrealistic assumption of homogeneous model architectures. Federated Distillation (FD), which aggregates locally computed logits instead of model parameters, introduces a promising alternative for cooperative training in heterogeneous model settings. Nevertheless, we recognize two major challenges in implementing SA for FD. (i) Prior SA designs encourage a dominant server, who is solely responsible for collecting, aggregating and distributing. Such central authority facilitates server to forge aggregation proofs or collude to bypass the claimed security guarantees; (ii) Existing SA, tailored for FL models, overlook the intrinsic properties of logits, making them unsuitable for FD. To address these challenges, we propose SVAFD, the first SA protocol that is specifically designed for FD. At a high level, SVAFD incorporates two innovations: (i) a multilateral co-aggregation method tha redefines the responsibilities of clients and server. Clients autonomously evaluate and aggregate logits shares locally with a lightweight coding scheme, while the server handles ciphertext decoding and performs the task of generating verification proofs; (ii) a quality-aware knowledge filtration method that facilitates biased logits exclusion against poisoning attacks. Moreover, SVAFD is resilient to stragglers and colluding clients, making it well-suited for dynamic networks in real-world applications. We have implemented the SVAFD prototype over four emerging FD architectures and evaluated it against poisoning and inference attacks. Results demonstrate that SVAFD improves model accuracy, making it a significant step forward in secure and verifiable aggregation for heterogeneous FL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables, 27 equations</p></details> |

In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CSC-SQL. On the BIRD development set, our 3B model achieves 65.28% execution accuracy, while the 7B model achieves 69.19%.

While learning-based methods have shown promise recently, head-to-head comparisons with cutting-edge optimization-based approaches are scarce, leaving open the question of where and to what extent they truly excel. In this paper, we introduce FlightBench, the first comprehensive benchmark that implements various learning-based methods for ego-vision-based navigation and evaluates them against mainstream optimization-based baselines using a broad set of performance metrics. More importantly, we develop a suite of criteria to assess scenario difficulty and design test cases that span different levels of difficulty based on these criteria. Our results show that while learning-based methods excel in high-speed flight and faster inference, they struggle with challenging scenarios like sharp corners or view occlusion. Analytical experiments validate the correlation between our difficulty criteria and flight performance. Moreover, we verify the trend in flight performance within real-world environments through full-pipeline and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. We hope this benchmark and these criteria will drive future advancements in learning-based navigation for ego-vision quadrotors.

We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

| **[Conditional Front-door Adjustment for Heterogeneous Treatment Assignment Effect Estimation Under Non-adherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05677v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimates of heterogeneous treatment assignment effects can inform treatment decisions. Under the presence of non-adherence (e.g., patients do not adhere to their assigned treatment), both the standard backdoor adjustment (SBD) and the conditional front-door adjustment (CFD) can recover unbiased estimates of the treatment assignment effects. However, the estimation variance of these approaches may vary widely across settings, which remains underexplored in the literature. In this work, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that CFD yields lower-variance estimates than SBD when the true effect of treatment assignment is small (i.e., assigning an intervention leads to small changes in patients' future outcome). Additionally, since CFD requires estimating multiple nuisance parameters, we introduce LobsterNet, a multi-task neural network that implements CFD with joint modeling of the nuisance parameters. Empirically, LobsterNet reduces estimation error across several semi-synthetic and real-world datasets compared to baselines. Our findings suggest CFD with shared nuisance parameter modeling can improve treatment assignment effect estimation under non-adherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Sampling: Scaling Inference Compute for Data Synthesis with Tree Search-Based Agentic Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17061v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws for inference compute in multi-agent systems remain under-explored compared to single-agent scenarios. This work aims to bridge this gap by investigating the problem of data synthesis through multi-agent sampling, where synthetic responses are generated by sampling from multiple distinct language models. Effective model coordination is crucial for successful multi-agent collaboration. Unlike previous approaches that rely on fixed workflows, we treat model coordination as a multi-step decision-making process, optimizing generation structures dynamically for each input question. We introduce Tree Search-based Orchestrated Agents~(TOA), where the workflow evolves iteratively during the sequential sampling process. To achieve this, we leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), integrating a reward model to provide real-time feedback and accelerate exploration. Our experiments on alignment, machine translation, and mathematical reasoning demonstrate that multi-agent sampling significantly outperforms single-agent sampling as inference compute scales. TOA is the most compute-efficient approach, achieving SOTA performance on WMT and a 72.2\% LC win rate on AlpacaEval. Moreover, fine-tuning with our synthesized alignment data surpasses strong preference learning methods on challenging benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and AlpacaEval.</p></details> | In submission |

Among these, 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) has emerged as an appealing approach due to its ability to model high-fidelity spatial and temporal variations. However, existing methods suffer from substantial computational and memory overhead due to the redundant allocation of 4D Gaussians to static regions, which can also degrade image quality. In this work, we introduce hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting (3D-4DGS), a novel framework that adaptively represents static regions with 3D Gaussians while reserving 4D Gaussians for dynamic elements. Our method begins with a fully 4D Gaussian representation and iteratively converts temporally invariant Gaussians into 3D, significantly reducing the number of parameters and improving computational efficiency. Meanwhile, dynamic Gaussians retain their full 4D representation, capturing complex motions with high fidelity. Our approach achieves significantly faster training times compared to baseline 4D Gaussian Splatting methods while maintaining or improving the visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ohsngjun.github.io/3D-4DGS/</p></details> |

The success of these methods relies on the alignment between draft candidates and the sampled outputs of the target model. Existing methods mainly achieve draft-target alignment with training-based methods, e.g., EAGLE, Medusa, involving considerable training costs. In this paper, we present a training-free alignment-augmented speculative decoding algorithm. We propose alignment sampling, which leverages output distribution obtained in the prefilling phase to provide more aligned draft candidates. To further benefit from high-quality but non-aligned draft candidates, we also introduce a simple yet effective flexible verification strategy. Through an adaptive probability threshold, our approach can improve generation accuracy while further improving inference efficiency. Experiments on 8 datasets (including question answering, summarization and code completion tasks) show that our approach increases the average generation score by 3.3 points for the LLaMA3 model. Our method achieves a mean acceptance length up to 2.39 and speed up generation by 2.23.</p></details> | Pre-print |

Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, \emph{unbalanced} probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

The energy distance offers an analytical measure of the distributional gap by contrasting simulated and target samples, enabling efficient training to capture the underlying continuous autoregressive distribution. By bypassing reliance on residual vector quantization, SLED avoids discretization errors and eliminates the need for the complicated hierarchical architectures common in existing speech language models. It simplifies the overall modeling pipeline while preserving the richness of speech information and maintaining inference efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that SLED achieves strong performance in both zero-shot and streaming speech synthesis, showing its potential for broader applications in general-purpose speech language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demos...</summary><p>Demos and code are available at https://github.com/ictnlp/SLED-TTS</p></details> |

Microscaling (MX) standardized formats have recently emerged as a promising alternative to baseline low-bitwidth FP formats, offering improved accuracy with a block-wise shared exponent scale combined with per-element values. However, efficiently executing the key linear algebra primitives for AI applications on MX formats requires specialized hardware support for the fundamental operators such as scaled dot product. In this work, we propose MXDOTP, the first RISC-V ISA extension for MX dot products, focusing on the 8-bit MXFP8 FP format. We extend the open-source Snitch RISC-V core with a dedicated MXFP8 dot product-accumulate unit, which fully consumes blocks of eight 8-bit operands packed into 64-bit inputs. To feed MXDOTP at full utilization with four operands per cycle, including block scales, we exploit Snitch's Stream Semantic Registers (SSRs), achieving up to 80% utilization with minimal impact on the Snitch core's architecture and no modification to the register file. Implemented in 12 nm FinFET, a cluster with eight MXDOTP-extended cores reaches up to 356 GFLOPS/W when computing MXFP8 matrix multiplications at 0.8 V, 1 GHz. Compared to a software baseline, where MX dot products are computed by type casting FP8 inputs to FP32 for higher accumulation precision and applying explicit block scaling, the cluster achieves 25x speedup and 12.5x better energy efficiency at a minimal 5.1% area increase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 36th IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

Current text-assisted-video-to-audio (VT2A) methods excel in video foley tasks but struggle to acquire audio descriptions during inference. We introduce the task of Reasoning Audio Descriptions from Silent Videos (SVAD) to address this challenge and investigate vision-language models' (VLMs) capabilities on this task. To further enhance the VLMs' reasoning capacity for the SVAD task, we construct a CoT-AudioCaps dataset and propose a Chain-of-Thought-based supervised fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on SVAD and subsequent VT2A tasks demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two key aspects: significantly improving VLMs' modal-mismatch reasoning for SVAD and effectively addressing the challenge of acquiring audio descriptions during VT2A inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Mixed Precision (MP) mitigates this tradeoff by varying the numerical precision across network layers. This study focuses on automatically selecting an optimal MP configuration within Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) for inference. The first key contribution is a novel sensitivity metric derived from a first-order Taylor series expansion of the loss function as a function of quantization errors in weights and activations. This metric, based on the Mean Square Error (MSE) of the loss, is efficiently calculated per layer using high-precision forward and backward passes over a small calibration dataset. The metric is additive across layers, with low calibration memory overhead as weight optimization is unnecessary. The second contribution is an accurate hardware-aware method for predicting MP time gain by modeling it as additive for sequential sub-graphs. An algorithm partitions the model graph into sequential subgraphs, measuring time gain for each configuration using a few samples. After calibrating per-layer sensitivity and time gain, an Integer Programming (IP) problem is formulated to maximize time gain while keeping loss MSE below a set threshold. Memory gain and theoretical time gain based on Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations are also considered. Rigorous experiments on the Intel Gaudi 2 accelerator validate the approach on several Large Language Models (LLMs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

We adopt the approach of treating explanation generation as a non-stationary decision process, where the optimal strategy varies according to changing beliefs about the explainee and the interaction context. In this paper we address the questions of (1) how to track the interaction context and the relevant listener features in a formally defined computational partner model, and (2) how to utilize this model in the dynamically adjusted, rational decision process that determines the currently best explanation strategy. We propose a Bayesian inference-based approach to continuously update the partner model based on user feedback, and a non-stationary Markov Decision Process to adjust decision-making based on the partner model values. We evaluate an implementation of this framework with five simulated interlocutors, demonstrating its effectiveness in adapting to different partners with constant and even changing feedback behavior. The results show high adaptivity with distinct explanation strategies emerging for different partners, highlighting the potential of our approach to improve explainable AI systems and dialogsystems in general.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently under review at Frontiers in Communication</p></details> |

However, existing constructive NCO methods still struggle to solve large-scale instances, which significantly limits their application prospects. To address these crucial shortcomings, this work proposes a novel Instance-Conditioned Adaptation Model (ICAM) for better large-scale generalization of neural routing solvers. In particular, we design a simple yet efficient instance-conditioned adaptation function to significantly improve the generalization performance of existing NCO models with a small time and memory overhead. In addition, with a systematic investigation on the performance of information incorporation between different attention mechanisms, we further propose a powerful yet low-complexity instance-conditioned adaptation module to generate better solutions for instances across different scales. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and benchmark instances show that our proposed method is capable of obtaining promising results with a very fast inference time in solving large-scale Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs), Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRPs), and Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems (ATSPs).

We present a novel framework for generative modeling of random fields (probability distributions over continuous functions) that incorporates domain knowledge to supplement limited, sparse, and indirect data. The foundation of the approach is latent flow matching, where generative modeling occurs on compressed function representations in the latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Innovations include the adoption of a function decoder within the VAE and integration of physical/statistical constraints into the VAE training process. In this way, a latent function representation is learned that yields continuous random field samples satisfying domain-specific constraints when decoded, even in data-limited regimes. Efficacy is demonstrated on two challenging applications: wind velocity field reconstruction from sparse sensors and material property inference from a limited number of indirect measurements. Results show that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to unconstrained methods and enables effective inference with relatively small training datasets that is intractable without constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages plus references and appendices, 17 figures</p></details> |

This challenge is twofold: (1) creating balanced and comprehensive homograph datasets is labor-intensive and costly, and (2) specific disambiguation strategies introduce additional latency, making them unsuitable for real-time applications such as screen readers and other accessibility tools. In this paper, we address both issues. First, we propose a semi-automated pipeline for constructing homograph-focused datasets, introduce the HomoRich dataset generated through this pipeline, and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to enhance a state-of-the-art deep learning-based G2P system for Persian. Second, we advocate for a paradigm shift - utilizing rich offline datasets to inform the development of fast, rule-based methods suitable for latency-sensitive accessibility applications like screen readers. To this end, we improve one of the most well-known rule-based G2P systems, eSpeak, into a fast homograph-aware version, HomoFast eSpeak. Our results show an approximate 30% improvement in homograph disambiguation accuracy for the deep learning-based and eSpeak systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main body pages, total 25 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |

However, traditional concept recognition methods, relying on explicit mention identification, often fail to capture complex concepts not explicitly stated in the text. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MA-COIR, a framework that reformulates concept recognition as an indexing-recognition task. By assigning semantic search indexes (ssIDs) to concepts, MA-COIR resolves ambiguities in ontology entries and enhances recognition efficiency. Using a pretrained BART-based model fine-tuned on small datasets, our approach reduces computational requirements to facilitate adoption by domain experts. Furthermore, we incorporate large language models (LLMs)-generated queries and synthetic data to improve recognition in low-resource settings. Experimental results on three scenarios (CDR, HPO, and HOIP) highlight the effectiveness of MA-COIR in recognizing both explicit and implicit concepts without the need for mention-level annotations during inference, advancing ontology-driven concept recognition in biomedical domain applications.

| **[Quantum (Inspired) $D^2$-sampling with Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13351v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>$D^2$-sampling is a fundamental component of sampling-based clustering algorithms such as $k$-means++. Given a dataset $V \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $N$ points and a center set $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $D^2$-sampling refers to picking a point from $V$ where the sampling probability of a point is proportional to its squared distance from the nearest center in $C$. Starting with empty $C$ and iteratively $D^2$-sampling and updating $C$ in $k$ rounds is precisely $k$-means++ seeding that runs in $O(Nkd)$ time and gives $O(\log{k})$-approximation in expectation for the $k$-means problem. We give a quantum algorithm for (approximate) $D^2$-sampling in the QRAM model that results in a quantum implementation of $k$-means++ that runs in time $\tilde{O}(\zeta^2 k^2)$. Here $\zeta$ is the aspect ratio (i.e., largest to smallest interpoint distance), and $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $N, d, k$. It can be shown through a robust approximation analysis of $k$-means++ that the quantum version preserves its $O(\log{k})$ approximation guarantee. Further, we show that our quantum algorithm for $D^2$-sampling can be 'dequantized' using the sample-query access model of Tang (PhD Thesis, Ewin Tang, University of Washington, 2023). This results in a fast quantum-inspired classical implementation of $k$-means++, which we call QI-$k$-means++, with a running time $O(Nd) + \tilde{O}(\zeta^2k^2d)$, where the $O(Nd)$ term is for setting up the sample-query access data structure. Experimental investigations show promising results for QI-$k$-means++ on large datasets with bounded aspect ratio. Finally, we use our quantum $D^2$-sampling with the known $ D^2$-sampling-based classical approximation scheme (i.e., $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation for any given $\varepsilon>0$) to obtain the first quantum approximation scheme for the $k$-means problem with polylogarithmic running time dependence on $N$.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.08167.

We introduce The Traitors, a multi-agent simulation framework inspired by social deduction games, designed to probe deception, trust formation, and strategic communication among large language model (LLM) agents under asymmetric information. A minority of agents the traitors seek to mislead the majority, while the faithful must infer hidden identities through dialogue and reasoning. Our contributions are: (1) we ground the environment in formal frameworks from game theory, behavioral economics, and social cognition; (2) we develop a suite of evaluation metrics capturing deception success, trust dynamics, and collective inference quality; (3) we implement a fully autonomous simulation platform where LLMs reason over persistent memory and evolving social dynamics, with support for heterogeneous agent populations, specialized traits, and adaptive behaviors. Our initial experiments across DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o (10 runs per model) reveal a notable asymmetry: advanced models like GPT-4o demonstrate superior deceptive capabilities yet exhibit disproportionate vulnerability to others' falsehoods. This suggests deception skills may scale faster than detection abilities. Overall, The Traitors provides a focused, configurable testbed for investigating LLM behavior in socially nuanced interactions. We position this work as a contribution toward more rigorous research on deception mechanisms, alignment challenges, and the broader social reliability of AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages, 31 pages</p></details> |

However, we note that such variability does have an underlying structure, composed of a hierarchy of patterns of related actions. We argue that such structure can emerge naturally from unscripted videos of human activities, and can be leveraged to better reason about their content. We present HiERO, a weakly-supervised method to enrich video segments features with the corresponding hierarchical activity threads. By aligning video clips with their narrated descriptions, HiERO infers contextual, semantic and temporal reasoning with an hierarchical architecture. We prove the potential of our enriched features with multiple video-text alignment benchmarks (EgoMCQ, EgoNLQ) with minimal additional training, and in zero-shot for procedure learning tasks (EgoProceL and Ego4D Goal-Step). Notably, HiERO achieves state-of-the-art performance in all the benchmarks, and for procedure learning tasks it outperforms fully-supervised methods by a large margin (+12.5% F1 on EgoProceL) in zero shot.

Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |

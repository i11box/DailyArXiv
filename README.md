| **[More Information is Not Always Better: Connections between Zero-Sum Local Nash Equilibria in Feedback and Open-Loop Information Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15486v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-cooperative dynamic game theory provides a principled approach to modeling sequential decision-making among multiple noncommunicative agents. A key focus has been on finding Nash equilibria in two-agent zero-sum dynamic games under various information structures. A well-known result states that in linear-quadratic games, unique Nash equilibria under feedback and open-loop information structures yield identical trajectories. Motivated by two key perspectives -- (i) many real-world problems extend beyond linear-quadratic settings and lack unique equilibria, making only local Nash equilibria computable, and (ii) local open-loop Nash equilibria (OLNE) are easier to compute than local feedback Nash equilibria (FBNE) -- it is natural to ask whether a similar result holds for local equilibria in zero-sum games. To this end, we establish that for a broad class of zero-sum games with potentially nonconvex-nonconcave objectives and nonlinear dynamics: (i) the state/control trajectory of a local FBNE satisfies local OLNE first-order optimality conditions, and vice versa, (ii) a local FBNE trajectory satisfies local OLNE second-order necessary conditions, (iii) a local FBNE trajectory satisfying feedback sufficiency conditions also constitutes a local OLNE, and (iv) with additional hard constraints on agents' actuations, a local FBNE where strict complementarity holds also satisfies local OLNE first-order optimality conditions, and vice versa.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Natural Quantization of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15482v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a natural quantization of a standard neural network, where the neurons correspond to qubits and the activation functions are implemented via quantum gates and measurements. The simplest quantized neural network corresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being dependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This realization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely classical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical neural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an intrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a subset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of "quantum advantage," where the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that in the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is introduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron qubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree of quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\frac\pi 2$ replicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also minimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum transition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a critical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily realizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11761v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). Our code, data, and model is publicly accessible at https://uni-medical.github.io/SlideChat.github.io.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Learning to Play Piano in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15481v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Towards the grand challenge of achieving human-level manipulation in robots, playing piano is a compelling testbed that requires strategic, precise, and flowing movements. Over the years, several works demonstrated hand-designed controllers on real world piano playing, while other works evaluated robot learning approaches on simulated piano scenarios. In this paper, we develop the first piano playing robotic system that makes use of learning approaches while also being deployed on a real world dexterous robot. Specifically, we make use of Sim2Real to train a policy in simulation using reinforcement learning before deploying the learned policy on a real world dexterous robot. In our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the interplay between domain randomization and the accuracy of the dynamics model used in simulation. Moreover, we evaluate the robot's performance across multiple songs with varying complexity to study the generalization of our learned policy. By providing a proof-of-concept of learning to play piano in the real world, we want to encourage the community to adopt piano playing as a compelling benchmark towards human-level manipulation. We open-source our code and show additional videos at https://lasr.org/research/learning-to-play-piano .</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[SWEET-RL: Training Multi-Turn LLM Agents on Collaborative Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15478v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents need to perform multi-turn interactions in real-world tasks. However, existing multi-turn RL algorithms for optimizing LLM agents fail to perform effective credit assignment over multiple turns while leveraging the generalization capabilities of LLMs and it remains unclear how to develop such algorithms. To study this, we first introduce a new benchmark, ColBench, where an LLM agent interacts with a human collaborator over multiple turns to solve realistic tasks in backend programming and frontend design. Building on this benchmark, we propose a novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with Step-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses a carefully designed optimization objective to train a critic model with access to additional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards for improving the policy model. Our experiments demonstrate that SWEET-RL achieves a 6% absolute improvement in success and win rates on ColBench compared to other state-of-the-art multi-turn RL algorithms, enabling Llama-3.1-8B to match or exceed the performance of GPT4-o in realistic collaborative content creation.</p></details> | 29 pages, 16 figures |
| **[What Makes a Reward Model a Good Teacher? An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15477v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. While this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/princeton-pli/what-makes-good-rm</p></details> |

Our goal at Roblox is to build such a foundation model for 3D intelligence, a model that can support developers in producing all aspects of a Roblox experience, from generating 3D objects and scenes to rigging characters for animation to producing programmatic scripts describing object behaviors. We discuss three key design requirements for such a 3D foundation model and then present our first step towards building such a model. We expect that 3D geometric shapes will be a core data type and describe our solution for 3D shape tokenizer. We show how our tokenization scheme can be used in applications for text-to-shape generation, shape-to-text generation and text-to-scene generation. We demonstrate how these applications can collaborate with existing large language models (LLMs) to perform scene analysis and reasoning. We conclude with a discussion outlining our path to building a fully unified foundation model for 3D intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code and model weights can be found at: https://github.com/Roblox/cube</p></details> |

State-of-the-art approaches underpinned with deep learning allow for obtaining outstanding results, generating images of high perceptual quality. However, it often remains unclear whether the reconstructed details are close to the actual ground-truth information and whether they constitute a more valuable source for image analysis algorithms. In the reported work, we address the latter problem, and we present our efforts toward learning super-resolution algorithms in a task-driven way to make them suitable for generating high-resolution images that can be exploited for automated image analysis. In the reported initial research, we propose a methodological approach for assessing the existing models that perform computer vision tasks in terms of whether they can be used for evaluating super-resolution reconstruction algorithms, as well as training them in a task-driven way. We support our analysis with experimental study and we expect it to establish a solid foundation for selecting appropriate computer vision tasks that will advance the capabilities of real-world super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE IGARSS 2024</p></details> |
| **[EgoDTM: Towards 3D-Aware Egocentric Video-Language Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15470v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Egocentric video-language pretraining has significantly advanced video representation learning. Humans perceive and interact with a fully 3D world, developing spatial awareness that extends beyond text-based understanding. However, most previous works learn from 1D text or 2D visual cues, such as bounding boxes, which inherently lack 3D understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoDTM, an Egocentric Depth- and Text-aware Model, jointly trained through large-scale 3D-aware video pretraining and video-text contrastive learning. EgoDTM incorporates a lightweight 3D-aware decoder to efficiently learn 3D-awareness from pseudo depth maps generated by depth estimation models. To further facilitate 3D-aware video pretraining, we enrich the original brief captions with hand-object visual cues by organically combining several foundation models. Extensive experiments demonstrate EgoDTM's superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its superior 3D-aware visual understanding. Our code will be released at https://github.com/xuboshen/EgoDTM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released at: https://github.com/xuboshen/EgoDTM</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Bi-Elman Attention Networks (DBEAN): Dual-Directional Context-Aware Representation Learning for Enhanced Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15469v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text classification, a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), aims to categorize textual data into predefined labels. Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. The advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite improvements, existing models exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. This paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN), which integrates bidirectional temporal modelling with self-attention mechanisms. DBEAN dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | 11 pages,1 figure |
| **[FP4DiT: Towards Effective Floating Point Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15465v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DM) have revolutionized the text-to-image visual generation process. However, the large computational cost and model footprint of DMs hinders practical deployment, especially on edge devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a lightweight method to alleviate these burdens without the need for training or fine-tuning. While recent DM PTQ methods achieve W4A8 on integer-based PTQ, two key limitations remain: First, while most existing DM PTQ methods evaluate on classical DMs like Stable Diffusion XL, 1.5 or earlier, which use convolutional U-Nets, newer Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models like the PixArt series, Hunyuan and others adopt fundamentally different transformer backbones to achieve superior image synthesis. Second, integer (INT) quantization is prevailing in DM PTQ but doesn't align well with the network weight and activation distribution, while Floating-Point Quantization (FPQ) is still under-investigated, yet it holds the potential to better align the weight and activation distributions in low-bit settings for DiT. In response, we introduce FP4DiT, a PTQ method that leverages FPQ to achieve W4A6 quantization. Specifically, we extend and generalize the Adaptive Rounding PTQ technique to adequately calibrate weight quantization for FPQ and demonstrate that DiT activations depend on input patch data, necessitating robust online activation quantization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that FP4DiT outperforms integer-based PTQ at W4A6 and W4A8 precision and generates convincing visual content on PixArt-$\alpha$, PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Hunyuan in terms of several T2I metrics such as HPSv2 and CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/cccrrrccc/FP4DiT</p></details> |
| **[A Precision Trial Case Study for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Obstructive Sleep Apnea](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15455v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision medicine tailors treatments to individual patient characteristics, which is especially valuable for conditions like obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where treatment responses vary widely. Traditional trials often overlook subgroup differences, leading to suboptimal recommendations. Current approaches rely on pre-specified thresholds with inherent uncertainty, assuming these thresholds are correct-a flawed assumption. This case study compares pre-specified thresholds to two advanced Bayesian methods: the established FK-BMA method and its novel variant, FK. The FK approach retains the flexibility of free-knot splines but omits variable selection, providing stable, interpretable models. Using biomarker data from large studies, this design identifies subgroups dynamically, allowing early trial termination or enrollment adjustments. Simulations in this specific context show FK improves precision, efficiency, and subgroup detection, offering practical benefits over FK-BMA and advancing precision medicine for OSA.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[MotionStreamer: Streaming Motion Generation via Diffusion-based Autoregressive Model in Causal Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15451v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of text-conditioned streaming motion generation, which requires us to predict the next-step human pose based on variable-length historical motions and incoming texts. Existing methods struggle to achieve streaming motion generation, e.g., diffusion models are constrained by pre-defined motion lengths, while GPT-based methods suffer from delayed response and error accumulation problem due to discretized non-causal tokenization. To solve these problems, we propose MotionStreamer, a novel framework that incorporates a continuous causal latent space into a probabilistic autoregressive model. The continuous latents mitigate information loss caused by discretization and effectively reduce error accumulation during long-term autoregressive generation. In addition, by establishing temporal causal dependencies between current and historical motion latents, our model fully utilizes the available information to achieve accurate online motion decoding. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches while offering more applications, including multi-round generation, long-term generation, and dynamic motion composition.

| **[SkyLadder: Better and Faster Pretraining via Context Window Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15450v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLM pretraining have featured ever-expanding context windows to process longer sequences. However, our pilot study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates us to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, we propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks. Through extensive experiments, we pre-train 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines.

| **[Controllable Latent Diffusion for Traffic Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11771v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The validation of autonomous driving systems benefits greatly from the ability to generate scenarios that are both realistic and precisely controllable. Conventional approaches, such as real-world test drives, are not only expensive but also lack the flexibility to capture targeted edge cases for thorough evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a controllable latent diffusion that guides the training of diffusion models via reinforcement learning to automatically generate a diverse and controllable set of driving scenarios for virtual testing. Our approach removes the reliance on large-scale real-world data by generating complex scenarios whose properties can be finely tuned to challenge and assess autonomous vehicle systems. Experimental results show that our approach has the lowest collision rate of $0.098$ and lowest off-road rate of $0.096$, demonstrating superiority over existing baselines. The proposed approach significantly improves the realism, stability and controllability of the generated scenarios, enabling more nuanced safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,2 figures, submitted to IROS conference</p></details> |

Since current cooperative perception algorithms are trained and tested on the same dataset, the generalization ability of cooperative perception systems remains underexplored. This paper is the first work to study the Domain Generalization problem of LiDAR-based V2X cooperative perception (V2X-DG) for 3D detection based on four widely-used open source datasets: OPV2V, V2XSet, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X. Our research seeks to sustain high performance not only within the source domain but also across other unseen domains, achieved solely through training on source domain. To this end, we propose Cooperative Mixup Augmentation based Generalization (CMAG) to improve the model generalization capability by simulating the unseen cooperation, which is designed compactly for the domain gaps in cooperative perception. Furthermore, we propose a constraint for the regularization of the robust generalized feature representation learning: Cooperation Feature Consistency (CFC), which aligns the intermediately fused features of the generalized cooperation by CMAG and the early fused features of the original cooperation in source domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance gains when generalizing to other unseen datasets while it also maintains strong performance on the source dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accurate, transferable, and verifiable machine-learned interatomic potentials for layered materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15432v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twisted layered van-der-Waals materials often exhibit unique electronic and optical properties absent in their non-twisted counterparts. Unfortunately, predicting such properties is hindered by the difficulty in determining the atomic structure in materials displaying large moir\'e domains. Here, we introduce a split machine-learned interatomic potential and dataset curation approach that separates intralayer and interlayer interactions and significantly improves model accuracy -- with a tenfold increase in energy and force prediction accuracy relative to conventional models. We further demonstrate that traditional MLIP validation metrics -- force and energy errors -- are inadequate for moir\'e structures and develop a more holistic, physically-motivated metric based on the distribution of stacking configurations. This metric effectively compares the entirety of large-scale moir\'e domains between two structures instead of relying on conventional measures evaluated on smaller commensurate cells. Finally, we establish that one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional moir\'e structures can serve as efficient surrogate systems for validating MLIPs, allowing for a practical model validation protocol against explicit DFT calculations. Applying our framework to HfS2/GaS bilayers reveals that accurate structural predictions directly translate into reliable electronic properties. Our model-agnostic approach integrates seamlessly with various intralayer and interlayer interaction models, enabling computationally tractable relaxation of moir\'e materials, from bilayer to complex multilayers, with rigorously validated accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

We establish a similar result for intensional type theories: weak models of Sigma-types and axiomatic Id-types are biequivalent to path categories. These axiomatic Id-types only satisfy beta-reduction rule as a propositional equality, and appear in cubical type theory, as well as axiomatic type theory (type theory without definitional equality). Path categories take inspiration from homotopy theory and simplify the structure of type theory using a primitive notion of equivalence. Our biequivalence allows us to turn path categories into actual models of type theory: we turn them into weak models, where substitution is only specified up to isomorphism, which we can in turn strictify using the left adjoint splitting. In addition, we introduce a more fine-grained notion: that of a display path category, and prove a similar biequivalence. These display path categories still model axiomatic Id-types, but not the intensional notion of Sigma-types. We show how they can be extended with axiomatic notions of Sigma-types and Pi-types, allowing us to model axiomatic type theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, comments welcome</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for their creative capabilities, the assessment of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in this domain remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce Creation-MMBench, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the creative capabilities of MLLMs in real-world, image-based tasks. The benchmark comprises 765 test cases spanning 51 fine-grained tasks. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define instance-specific evaluation criteria for each test case, guiding the assessment of both general response quality and factual consistency with visual inputs. Experimental results reveal that current open-source MLLMs significantly underperform compared to proprietary models in creative tasks. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities. Creation-MMBench provides valuable insights for advancing MLLM creativity and establishes a foundation for future improvements in multimodal generative intelligence.

These noisy artifacts will impact model performance. We formulate this problem as a data valuation task, assigning a value to data points in the training set according to how similar or dissimilar they are to a clean and curated validation set. Recently, LAVA demonstrated the use of optimal transport (OT) between a large noisy training dataset and a clean validation set, to value training data efficiently, without the dependency on model performance. However, the LAVA algorithm requires the entire dataset as an input, this limits its application to larger datasets. Inspired by the scalability of stochastic (gradient) approaches which carry out computations on batches of data points instead of the entire dataset, we analogously propose SAVA, a scalable variant of LAVA with its computation on batches of data points. Intuitively, SAVA follows the same scheme as LAVA which leverages the hierarchically defined OT for data valuation. However, while LAVA processes the whole dataset, SAVA divides the dataset into batches of data points, and carries out the OT problem computation on those batches. Moreover, our theoretical derivations on the trade-off of using entropic regularization for OT problems include refinements of prior work. We perform extensive experiments, to demonstrate that SAVA can scale to large datasets with millions of data points and does not trade off data valuation performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025. 27 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

We support our analysis with experimental study and we expect it to establish a solid foundation for selecting appropriate computer vision tasks that will advance the capabilities of real-world super-resolution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE IGARSS 2024</p></details> |

Traditional methods struggled with complex linguistic structures and semantic dependencies. The advent of deep learning, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformer-based models, has significantly advanced the field by enabling nuanced feature extraction and context-aware predictions. Despite improvements, existing models exhibit limitations in balancing interpretability, computational efficiency, and long-range contextual understanding. This paper proposes the Dynamic Bidirectional Elman with Attention Network (DBEAN), which integrates bidirectional temporal modelling with self-attention mechanisms. DBEAN dynamically assigns weights to critical segments of input, improving contextual representation while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | 11 pages,1 figure |
| **[FP4DiT: Towards Effective Floating Point Quantization for Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15465v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models (DM) have revolutionized the text-to-image visual generation process. However, the large computational cost and model footprint of DMs hinders practical deployment, especially on edge devices. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a lightweight method to alleviate these burdens without the need for training or fine-tuning. While recent DM PTQ methods achieve W4A8 on integer-based PTQ, two key limitations remain: First, while most existing DM PTQ methods evaluate on classical DMs like Stable Diffusion XL, 1.5 or earlier, which use convolutional U-Nets, newer Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models like the PixArt series, Hunyuan and others adopt fundamentally different transformer backbones to achieve superior image synthesis. Second, integer (INT) quantization is prevailing in DM PTQ but doesn't align well with the network weight and activation distribution, while Floating-Point Quantization (FPQ) is still under-investigated, yet it holds the potential to better align the weight and activation distributions in low-bit settings for DiT. In response, we introduce FP4DiT, a PTQ method that leverages FPQ to achieve W4A6 quantization. Specifically, we extend and generalize the Adaptive Rounding PTQ technique to adequately calibrate weight quantization for FPQ and demonstrate that DiT activations depend on input patch data, necessitating robust online activation quantization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that FP4DiT outperforms integer-based PTQ at W4A6 and W4A8 precision and generates convincing visual content on PixArt-$\alpha$, PixArt-$\Sigma$ and Hunyuan in terms of several T2I metrics such as HPSv2 and CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/cccrrrccc/FP4DiT</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona</p></details> |
| **[Improving Adversarial Transferability on Vision Transformers via Forward Propagation Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15404v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been widely applied in various computer vision and vision-language tasks. To gain insights into their robustness in practical scenarios, transferable adversarial examples on ViTs have been extensively studied. A typical approach to improving adversarial transferability is by refining the surrogate model. However, existing work on ViTs has restricted their surrogate refinement to backward propagation. In this work, we instead focus on Forward Propagation Refinement (FPR) and specifically refine two key modules of ViTs: attention maps and token embeddings. For attention maps, we propose Attention Map Diversification (AMD), which diversifies certain attention maps and also implicitly imposes beneficial gradient vanishing during backward propagation. For token embeddings, we propose Momentum Token Embedding (MTE), which accumulates historical token embeddings to stabilize the forward updates in both the Attention and MLP blocks. We conduct extensive experiments with adversarial examples transferred from ViTs to various CNNs and ViTs, demonstrating that our FPR outperforms the current best (backward) surrogate refinement by up to 7.0\% on average. We also validate its superiority against popular defenses and its compatibility with other transfer methods. Codes and appendix are available at https://github.com/RYC-98/FPR.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |

Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/</p></details> | 22 pages |

When the linear systems in successive iterations differ by a low-rank modification (as is common in active set and augmented Lagrangian methods), updating the existing factorization can offer significant performance improvements over recomputing a full Cholesky factorization. We review the hyperbolic Householder transformation, and demonstrate its usefulness in describing low-rank Cholesky factorization updates. By applying this hyperbolic Householder-based framework to the well-known Riccati recursion for solving saddle-point problems with optimal control structure, we develop a novel algorithm for updating the factorizations used in optimization solvers for optimal control. Specifically, the proposed method can be used to efficiently solve the semismooth Newton systems that are at the core of the augmented Lagrangian-based QPALM-OCP solver. An optimized open-source implementation of the proposed factorization update routines is provided as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available at https://github.com/kul-optec/hyhound</p></details> |

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables; GitHub: https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety</p></details> |
| **[EfficientLLaVA:Generalizable Auto-Pruning for Large Vision-language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15369v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models demonstrate strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, they pose significant challenges related to model complexity during deployment, especially for resource-limited devices. In this paper, we propose an automatic pruning method for large vision-language models to enhance the efficiency of multimodal reasoning. Conventional methods rely on the training data of the original model to select the proper pruning ratio for different network components. However, these methods are impractical for large vision-language models due to the unaffordable search costs caused by web-scale training corpus. In contrast, our approach only leverages a small number of samples to search for the desired pruning policy by maximizing its generalization ability on unknown training data while maintaining the model accuracy, which enables the achievement of an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for large visual language models. Specifically, we formulate the generalization gap of the pruning strategy using the structural risk minimization principle. Based on both task performance and generalization capability, we iteratively search for the optimal pruning policy within a given search space and optimize the vision projector to evolve the search space with higher upper bound of performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the ScienceQA, Vizwiz, MM-vet, and LLaVA-Bench datasets for the task of visual question answering. Using only 64 samples for pruning policy search, EfficientLLaVA achieves an accuracy of 83.05% on ScienceQA, along with a $\times$ 1.8 speedup compared to the dense LLaVA-v1.5-7B model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

We focus on the case where the mixing is close to a local isometry in a suitable distance and show based on existing rigidity results that the mixing can be identified up to linear transformations and small errors. In a second step, we investigate Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with observations generated according to $x=f(s)=As+h(s)$ where $A$ is an invertible mixing matrix and $h$ a small perturbation. We show that we can approximately recover the matrix $A$ and the independent components. Together, these two results show approximate identifiability of nonlinear ICA with almost isometric mixing functions. Those results are a step towards identifiability results for unsupervised representation learning for real-world data that do not follow restrictive model classes.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Data-Free Dynamic Compression of CNNs for Tractable Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17211v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reduce the computational cost of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices, structured pruning approaches have shown promise in lowering floating-point operations (FLOPs) without substantial drops in accuracy. However, most methods require fine-tuning or specific training procedures to achieve a reasonable trade-off between retained accuracy and reduction in FLOPs, adding computational overhead and requiring training data to be available. To this end, we propose HASTE (Hashing for Tractable Efficiency), a data-free, plug-and-play convolution module that instantly reduces a network's test-time inference cost without training or fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to detect redundancies in the channel dimension of latent feature maps, compressing similar channels to reduce input and filter depth simultaneously, resulting in cheaper convolutions. We demonstrate our approach on the popular vision benchmarks CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where we achieve a 46.72% reduction in FLOPs with only a 1.25% loss in accuracy by swapping the convolution modules in a ResNet34 on CIFAR-10 for our HASTE module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISAPP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recover and Match: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition through Knowledge-Constrained Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15337v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying multiple novel classes in an image, known as open-vocabulary multi-label recognition, is a challenging task in computer vision. Recent studies explore the transfer of powerful vision-language models such as CLIP. However, these approaches face two critical challenges: (1) The local semantics of CLIP are disrupted due to its global pre-training objectives, resulting in unreliable regional predictions. (2) The matching property between image regions and candidate labels has been neglected, relying instead on naive feature aggregation such as average pooling, which leads to spurious predictions from irrelevant regions. In this paper, we present RAM (Recover And Match), a novel framework that effectively addresses the above issues. To tackle the first problem, we propose Ladder Local Adapter (LLA) to enforce refocusing on local regions, recovering local semantics in a memory-friendly way. For the second issue, we propose Knowledge-Constrained Optimal Transport (KCOT) to suppress meaningless matching to non-GT labels by formulating the task as an optimal transport problem. As a result, RAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets from three distinct domains, and shows great potential to boost the existing methods.

Existing methods achieve certain success by improving knowledge distillation and exemplar replay for transformer-based detection frameworks, but the intrinsic forgetting mechanisms remain underexplored. In this paper, we dive into the cause of forgetting and discover forgetting imbalance between localization and recognition in transformer-based IOD, which means that localization is less-forgetting and can generalize to future classes, whereas catastrophic forgetting occurs primarily on recognition. Based on these insights, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Amnesia (DCA) strategy, which redesigns the transformer-based IOD into a localization-then-recognition process. DCA can well maintain and transfer the localization ability, leaving decoupled fragile recognition to be specially conquered. To reduce feature drift in recognition, we leverage semantic knowledge encoded in pre-trained language models to anchor class representations within a unified feature space across incremental tasks. This involves designing a duplex classifier fusion and embedding class semantic features into the recognition decoding process in the form of queries. Extensive experiments validate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially for long-term incremental scenarios. For example, under the four-step setting on MS-COCO, our DCA strategy significantly improves the final AP by 6.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Test-Time Backdoor Detection for Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15293v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers poison a small subset of training samples by embedding a predefined trigger to manipulate prediction. Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences. TRACE achieves black-box, universal backdoor detection, with extensive experiments showing a 30% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art defenses and resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, several high-impact animal behaviour datasets and methods have been introduced to encourage their use; however, the role of behaviour-correlated background information and its significant effect on out-of-distribution generalisation remain unexplored. In response, we present the PanAf-FGBG dataset, featuring 20 hours of wild chimpanzee behaviours, recorded at over 350 individual camera locations. Uniquely, it pairs every video with a chimpanzee (referred to as a foreground video) with a corresponding background video (with no chimpanzee) from the same camera location. We present two views of the dataset: one with overlapping camera locations and one with disjoint locations. This setup enables, for the first time, direct evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditions, and for the impact of backgrounds on behaviour recognition models to be quantified. All clips come with rich behavioural annotations and metadata including unique camera IDs and detailed textual scene descriptions. Additionally, we establish several baselines and present a highly effective latent-space normalisation technique that boosts out-of-distribution performance by +5.42% mAP for convolutional and +3.75% mAP for transformer-based models. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis on the role of backgrounds in out-of-distribution behaviour recognition, including the so far unexplored impact of background durations (i.e., the count of background frames within foreground videos).</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)</p></details> |

In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, and news, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Traditional optimization-based methods often require hours of computational time to reconstruct geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from dense multi-view inputs, while still struggling with inherent ambiguities between lighting and material. On the other hand, learning-based approaches leverage rich material priors from existing 3D object datasets but face challenges with maintaining multi-view consistency. In this paper, we introduce IDArb, a diffusion-based model designed to perform intrinsic decomposition on an arbitrary number of images under varying illuminations. Our method achieves accurate and multi-view consistent estimation on surface normals and material properties. This is made possible through a novel cross-view, cross-domain attention module and an illumination-augmented, view-adaptive training strategy. Additionally, we introduce ARB-Objaverse, a new dataset that provides large-scale multi-view intrinsic data and renderings under diverse lighting conditions, supporting robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDArb outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, our approach facilitates a range of downstream tasks, including single-image relighting, photometric stereo, and 3D reconstruction, highlighting its broad applications in realistic 3D content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025.

However, advancements in generative AI for code overlook foundational Software Engineering (SE) principles such as modularity, and single responsibility, and concepts such as cohesion and coupling which are critical for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust software systems. These concepts are missing in pipelines that start with pre-training and end with the evaluation using benchmarks. This vision paper argues for the integration of SE knowledge into LLMs to enhance their capability to understand, analyze, and generate code and other SE artifacts following established SE knowledge. The aim is to propose a new direction where LLMs can move beyond mere functional accuracy to perform generative tasks that require adherence to SE principles and best practices. In addition, given the interactive nature of these conversational models, we propose using Bloom's Taxonomy as a framework to assess the extent to which they internalize SE knowledge. The proposed evaluation framework offers a sound and more comprehensive evaluation technique compared to existing approaches such as linear probing. Software engineering native generative models will not only overcome the shortcomings present in current models but also pave the way for the next generation of generative models capable of handling real-world software engineering.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

The commonly recognized best option for this is a Riccati recursion based solver, which has a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N(n_x^3 + n_x^2 n_u + n_x n_u^2 + n_u^3))$. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{Brunovsky Riccati Recursion} algorithm to solve LQ OCPs for Linear Time Invariant (LTI) systems. The algorithm transforms the system into Brunovsky form, formulates a new LQ cost (and constraints, if any) in Brunovsky coordinates, performs the Riccati recursion there, and converts the solution back. Due to the sparsity (block-diagonality and zero-one pattern per block) of Brunovsky form and the data parallelism introduced in the cost, constraints, and solution transformations, the time complexity of the new method is greatly reduced to $\mathcal{O}(n_x^3 + N(n_x^2 n_u + n_x n_u^2 + n_u^3))$ if $N$ threads/cores are available for parallel computing.</p></details> | Accepted by ACC 2025 |

However, due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material description of point cloud representations, there are ambiguities in distinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces, as well as transparent or reflective objects. To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS) point cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically, wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids, while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally, the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result, ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input, we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community, which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS point cloud input, especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects, but also demonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Concept-based post-hoc explanation methods can provide both global and local insights into model decisions. However, current methods in this field face challenges in that they are inflexible to automatically construct accurate and sufficient linguistic explanations for global concepts and local circuits. Particularly, the intrinsic polysemanticity in semantic Visual Concepts (VCs) impedes the interpretability of concepts and DVMs, which is underestimated severely. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Explanation (CoE) approach to address these issues. Specifically, CoE automates the decoding and description of VCs to construct global concept explanation datasets. Further, to alleviate the effect of polysemanticity on model explainability, we design a concept polysemanticity disentanglement and filtering mechanism to distinguish the most contextually relevant concept atoms. Besides, a Concept Polysemanticity Entropy (CPE), as a measure of model interpretability, is formulated to quantify the degree of concept uncertainty. The modeling of deterministic concepts is upgraded to uncertain concept atom distributions. Finally, CoE automatically enables linguistic local explanations of the decision-making process of DVMs by tracing the concept circuit. GPT-4o and human-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CPE and the superiority of CoE, achieving an average absolute improvement of 36% in terms of explainability scores.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[State Space Model Meets Transformer: A New Paradigm for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14493v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DETR-based methods, which use multi-layer transformer decoders to refine object queries iteratively, have shown promising performance in 3D indoor object detection. However, the scene point features in the transformer decoder remain fixed, leading to minimal contributions from later decoder layers, thereby limiting performance improvement. Recently, State Space Models (SSM) have shown efficient context modeling ability with linear complexity through iterative interactions between system states and inputs. Inspired by SSMs, we propose a new 3D object DEtection paradigm with an interactive STate space model (DEST). In the interactive SSM, we design a novel state-dependent SSM parameterization method that enables system states to effectively serve as queries in 3D indoor detection tasks. In addition, we introduce four key designs tailored to the characteristics of point cloud and SSM: The serialization and bidirectional scanning strategies enable bidirectional feature interaction among scene points within the SSM. The inter-state attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations.

Cryptocurrencies are characterised by high market volatility and susceptibility to substantial crashes, issues that require temporal analysis methodologies able to tackle the high temporal resolution, heterogeneity and scale of blockchain data. While existing research attempts to analyse crash events, fundamental questions persist regarding the optimal time scale for analysis, differentiation between long-term and short-term trends, and the identification and characterisation of shock events within these decentralised systems. This paper addresses these issues by examining cryptocurrencies traded on the Ethereum blockchain, with a spotlight on the crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD and the currency LUNA designed to stabilise it. Utilising complex network analysis and a multi-layer temporal graph allows the study of the correlations between the layers representing the currencies and system evolution across diverse time scales. The investigation sheds light on the strong interconnections among stablecoins pre-crash and the significant post-crash transformations. We identify anomalous signals before, during, and after the collapse, emphasising their impact on graph structure metrics and user movement across layers. This paper pioneers temporal, cross-chain graph analysis to explore a cryptocurrency collapse. It emphasises the importance of temporal analysis for studies on web-derived data and how graph-based analysis can enhance traditional econometric results. Overall, this research carries implications beyond its field, for example for regulatory agencies aiming to safeguard users from shocks and monitor investment risks for citizens and clients.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear Transactions on Web</p></details> |

Recently it has been suggested that child-directed speech (CDS) can improve training data efficiency of modern language models based on Transformer neural networks. However, it is not yet understood which specific properties of CDS are effective for training these models. In the context of the BabyLM Challenge, we focus on Variation Sets (VSs), sets of consecutive utterances expressing a similar intent with slightly different words and structures, which are ubiquitous in CDS. To assess the impact of VSs on training data efficiency, we augment CDS data with different proportions of artificial VSs and use these datasets to train an auto-regressive model, GPT-2. We find that the best proportion of VSs depends on the evaluation benchmark: BLiMP and GLUE scores benefit from the presence of VSs, but EWOK scores do not. Additionally, the results vary depending on multiple factors such as the number of epochs and the order of utterance presentation. Taken together, these findings suggest that VSs can have a beneficial influence on language models, while leaving room for further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BabyLM challenge 2024 at CONLL 2024 ( https://aclanthology.org/2024.conll-babylm.23 )</p></details> |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Transistor Compact Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15209v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network (NN)-based transistor compact modeling has recently emerged as a transformative solution for accelerating device modeling and SPICE circuit simulations. However, conventional NN architectures, despite their widespread adoption in state-of-the-art methods, primarily function as black-box problem solvers. This lack of interpretability significantly limits their capacity to extract and convey meaningful insights into learned data patterns, posing a major barrier to their broader adoption in critical modeling tasks. This work introduces, for the first time, Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for the transistor - a groundbreaking NN architecture that seamlessly integrates interpretability with high precision in physics-based function modeling. We systematically evaluate the performance of KAN and Fourier KAN for FinFET compact modeling, benchmarking them against the golden industry-standard compact model and the widely used MLP architecture. Our results reveal that KAN and FKAN consistently achieve superior prediction accuracy for critical figures of merit, including gate current, drain charge, and source charge. Furthermore, we demonstrate and improve the unique ability of KAN to derive symbolic formulas from learned data patterns - a capability that not only enhances interpretability but also facilitates in-depth transistor analysis and optimization. This work highlights the transformative potential of KAN in bridging the gap between interpretability and precision in NN-driven transistor compact modeling. By providing a robust and transparent approach to transistor modeling, KAN represents a pivotal advancement for the semiconductor industry as it navigates the challenges of advanced technology scaling.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

However, building multilingual SRL models is challenging due to the scarcity of semantically annotated corpora for multiple languages. Moreover, state-of-the-art SRL projection (XSRL) based on large language models (LLMs) yields output that is riddled with spurious role labels. Remediation of such hallucinations is not straightforward due to the lack of explainability of LLMs. We show that hallucinated role labels are related to naturally occurring divergence types that interfere with initial alignments. We implement Divergence-Aware Hallucination-Remediated SRL projection (DAHRS), leveraging linguistically-informed alignment remediation followed by greedy First-Come First-Assign (FCFA) SRL projection. DAHRS improves the accuracy of SRL projection without additional transformer-based machinery, beating XSRL in both human and automatic comparisons, and advancing beyond headwords to accommodate phrase-level SRL projection (e.g., EN-FR, EN-ES). Using CoNLL-2009 as our ground truth, we achieve a higher word-level F1 over XSRL: 87.6% vs. 77.3% (EN-FR) and 89.0% vs. 82.7% (EN-ES). Human phrase-level assessments yield 89.1% (EN-FR) and 91.0% (EN-ES). We also define a divergence metric to adapt our approach to other language pairs (e.g., English-Tagalog).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to The 29th International Conference on Natural Language & Information Systems (NLDB 2024)</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we propose a novel VLN task, named Long-Horizon Vision-Language Navigation (LH-VLN), which emphasizes long-term planning and decision consistency across consecutive subtasks. Furthermore, to support LH-VLN, we develop an automated data generation platform NavGen, which constructs datasets with complex task structures and improves data utility through a bidirectional, multi-granularity generation approach. To accurately evaluate complex tasks, we construct the Long-Horizon Planning and Reasoning in VLN (LHPR-VLN) benchmark consisting of 3,260 tasks with an average of 150 task steps, serving as the first dataset specifically designed for the long-horizon vision-language navigation task. Furthermore, we propose Independent Success Rate (ISR), Conditional Success Rate (CSR), and CSR weight by Ground Truth (CGT) metrics, to provide fine-grained assessments of task completion. To improve model adaptability in complex tasks, we propose a novel Multi-Granularity Dynamic Memory (MGDM) module that integrates short-term memory blurring with long-term memory retrieval to enable flexible navigation in dynamic environments. Our platform, benchmark and method supply LH-VLN with a robust data generation pipeline, comprehensive model evaluation dataset, reasonable metrics, and a novel VLN model, establishing a foundational framework for advancing LH-VLN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

However, computational constraints and the practical necessity for real-time deployment require smaller query resolutions, which inevitably leads to an information loss. Therefore, it is essential to encode and preserve rich visual details within limited query sizes while ensuring a comprehensive representation of 3D occupancy. To this end, we introduce ProtoOcc, a novel occupancy network that leverages prototypes of clustered image segments in view transformation to enhance low-resolution context. In particular, the mapping of 2D prototypes onto 3D voxel queries encodes high-level visual geometries and complements the loss of spatial information from reduced query resolutions. Additionally, we design a multi-perspective decoding strategy to efficiently disentangle the densely compressed visual cues into a high-dimensional 3D occupancy scene. Experimental results on both Occ3D and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing clear improvements over the baselines. More importantly, ProtoOcc achieves competitive performance against the baselines even with 75\% reduced voxel resolution.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |

Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

While recent work has explored unlearning in Euclidean contrastive vision-language models, the effectiveness of concept removal in hyperbolic spaces remains unexplored. This paper investigates machine unlearning in hyperbolic contrastive learning by adapting Alignment Calibration to MERU, a model that embeds images and text in hyperbolic space to better capture semantic hierarchies. Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations. These findings not only advance machine unlearning techniques but also provide insights into the geometric properties that influence concept representation and removal in multimodal models.

Current INR image classification methods are demonstrated on low-resolution data and are sensitive to image-space transformations. We attribute these issues to the global, fully-connected MLP neural network architecture encoding of current INRs, which lack mechanisms for local representation: MLPs are sensitive to absolute image location and struggle with high-frequency details. We propose ARC: Anchored Representation Clouds, a novel INR architecture that explicitly anchors latent vectors locally in image-space. By introducing spatial structure to the latent vectors, ARC captures local image data which in our testing leads to state-of-the-art implicit image classification of both low- and high-resolution images and increased robustness against image-space translation.

However, in real-world scenarios, captured depth data often suffer from unconventional and unknown degradation due to sensor limitations and complex imaging environments (e.g., low reflective surfaces, varying illumination). Consequently, the performance of these methods significantly declines when real-world degradation deviate from their assumptions. In this paper, we propose the Degradation Oriented and Regularized Network (DORNet), a novel framework designed to adaptively address unknown degradation in real-world scenes through implicit degradation representations. Our approach begins with the development of a self-supervised degradation learning strategy, which models the degradation representations of low-resolution depth data using routing selection-based degradation regularization. To facilitate effective RGB-D fusion, we further introduce a degradation-oriented feature transformation module that selectively propagates RGB content into the depth data based on the learned degradation priors. Extensive experimental results on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DORNet in handling unknown degradation, outperforming existing methods.

Existing correspondence-based approaches typically adopt point-based representations to establish the correspondences between primitive observed points and normalized object coordinates. However, due to the inherent shape-dependence of canonical coordinates, these methods suffer from semantic incoherence across diverse object shapes. To resolve this issue, we innovatively leverage the sphere as a shared proxy shape of objects to learn shape-independent transformation via spherical representations. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel architecture called SpherePose, which yields precise correspondence prediction through three core designs. Firstly, We endow the point-wise feature extraction with SO(3)-invariance, which facilitates robust mapping between camera coordinate space and object coordinate space regardless of rotation transformation. Secondly, the spherical attention mechanism is designed to propagate and integrate features among spherical anchors from a comprehensive perspective, thus mitigating the interference of noise and incomplete point cloud. Lastly, a hyperbolic correspondence loss function is designed to distinguish subtle distinctions, which can promote the precision of correspondence prediction. Experimental results on CAMERA25, REAL275 and HouseCat6D benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method, verifying the effectiveness of spherical representations and architectural innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aaltoml.github.io/BayesVLM/</p></details> |

Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding, in particular in the context of depth perception. However, it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this, we examine whether the monocular depth cues, similar to those used by the human visual system, emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark, DepthCues, designed to evaluate depth cue understanding, and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models. Our analysis shows that human-like depth cues emerge in more recent larger models. We also explore enhancing depth perception in large vision models by fine-tuning on DepthCues, and find that even without dense depth supervision, this improves depth estimation. To support further research, our benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available for studying depth perception in vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

Recent efforts typically adopt the Masked Video Modeling (MVM) paradigm, leading to significant progress on multiple video tasks. However, two critical challenges remain: 1) Without human annotations, the random temporal sampling introduces uncertainty, increasing the difficulty of model training. 2) Previous MVM methods primarily recover the masked patches in the pixel space, leading to insufficient information compression for downstream tasks. To address these challenges jointly, we propose a self-supervised framework that leverages Temporal Correspondence for video Representation learning (T-CoRe). For challenge 1), we propose a sandwich sampling strategy that selects two auxiliary frames to reduce reconstruction uncertainty in a two-side-squeezing manner. Addressing challenge 2), we introduce an auxiliary branch into a self-distillation architecture to restore representations in the latent space, generating high-level semantic representations enriched with temporal information. Experiments of T-CoRe consistently present superior performance across several downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness for video representation learning.

TCCL integrates contrastive learning principles with continual learning mechanisms, featuring a three-component architecture: an Encoder for data transformation, a Decoder for representation learning, and a Learner Head. We evaluate TCCL against 14 baseline models, including state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT), across eight diverse tabular datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that TCCL consistently outperforms existing methods in both classification and regression tasks on OOD data, with particular strength in handling distribution shifts.

In this paper, we explore utilizing visual signals as a new interface for models to interact with the environment. Specifically, we choose videos as a representative visual signal. And by training autoregressive Transformers on video datasets in a self-supervised objective, we find that the model emerges a zero-shot capability to infer the semantics from a demonstration video, and imitate the semantics to an unseen scenario. This allows the models to perform unseen tasks by watching the demonstration video in an in-context manner, without further fine-tuning. To validate the imitation capacity, we design various evaluation metrics including both objective and subjective measures. The results show that our models can generate high-quality video clips that accurately align with the semantic guidance provided by the demonstration videos, and we also show that the imitation capacity follows the scaling law.

Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed for imaging deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is in computational imaging: the co-development of optics and algorithms where the optics are designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, and the algorithms compensate by inverting the optical image coding process to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopic video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the information loss by extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to integrate the fluorescence of neighboring lines into a single set of measurements. By imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame, NORA diversifies the information collected across frames and enables video-level reconstruction. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame using image-level recovery, NORA recovers full video sequences through a nuclear-norm minimization (i.e., matrix completion) on the pixels-by-time matrix. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulation suite. Using these simulations we demonstrate that NORA imaging can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, most methods require fine-tuning or specific training procedures to achieve a reasonable trade-off between retained accuracy and reduction in FLOPs, adding computational overhead and requiring training data to be available. To this end, we propose HASTE (Hashing for Tractable Efficiency), a data-free, plug-and-play convolution module that instantly reduces a network's test-time inference cost without training or fine-tuning. Our approach utilizes locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to detect redundancies in the channel dimension of latent feature maps, compressing similar channels to reduce input and filter depth simultaneously, resulting in cheaper convolutions. We demonstrate our approach on the popular vision benchmarks CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where we achieve a 46.72% reduction in FLOPs with only a 1.25% loss in accuracy by swapping the convolution modules in a ResNet34 on CIFAR-10 for our HASTE module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at VISAPP 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we explore how hierarchical summative correlation between discrete variables allows for both probabilistic and exact solutions to attribute values in the 2021 Canadian Census disclosure. We demonstrate that, in some cases, it is possible to "unround" and extract the original private values before rounding, both in the presence and absence of provided population invariants. Using these methods, we expose the exact value of 624 previously private attributes in the 2021 Canadian census disclosure. We also infer the potential values of more than 1000 private attributes with a high probability of correctness.

To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed. To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0-5k, 5-10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[The Effects of iBGP Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15249v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing violations of forwarding properties is a classic networking problem. However, existing work is either tailored to the steady state -- and not to transient states during iBGP convergence -- or does analyze transient violations but with inaccurate proxies, like control-plane convergence, or without precise control over the different impact factors. We address this gap with a measurement framework that controllably and accurately measures transient violation times in realistic network deployments. The framework relies on a programmable switch to flexibly emulate diverse topologies and gain traffic visibility at all links -- enabling accurately inferring violation times of any forwarding property. Using the framework, we analyze 50 network scenarios on a topology with 12 real routers, and show how factors like the network configuration and BGP event affect transient violation times. Further, we shed light on less-known aspects of BGP convergence, including that transient violations can start before the trigger event, or that keeping a backup route advertised at all times can increase violation times.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Automated Non-Functional Requirements Generation in Software Engineering with Large Language Models: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15248v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neglecting non-functional requirements (NFRs) early in software development can lead to critical challenges. Despite their importance, NFRs are often overlooked or difficult to identify, impacting software quality. To support requirements engineers in eliciting NFRs, we developed a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive quality-driven NFRs from functional requirements (FRs). Using a custom prompting technique within a Deno-based pipeline, the system identifies relevant quality attributes for each functional requirement and generates corresponding NFRs, aiding systematic integration. A crucial aspect is evaluating the quality and suitability of these generated requirements. Can LLMs produce high-quality NFR suggestions? Using 34 functional requirements - selected as a representative subset of 3,964 FRs-the LLMs inferred applicable attributes based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 standard, generating 1,593 NFRs. A horizontal evaluation covered three dimensions: NFR validity, applicability of quality attributes, and classification precision. Ten industry software quality evaluators, averaging 13 years of experience, assessed a subset for relevance and quality. The evaluation showed strong alignment between LLM-generated NFRs and expert assessments, with median validity and applicability scores of 5.0 (means: 4.63 and 4.59, respectively) on a 1-5 scale. In the classification task, 80.4% of LLM-assigned attributes matched expert choices, with 8.3% near misses and 11.3% mismatches. A comparative analysis of eight LLMs highlighted variations in performance, with gemini-1.5-pro exhibiting the highest attribute accuracy, while llama-3.3-70B achieved higher validity and applicability scores. These findings provide insights into the feasibility of using LLMs for automated NFR generation and lay the foundation for further exploration of AI-assisted requirements engineering.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches" that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms. We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

While widely used in reinforcement learning, they lack the structured, adaptive representations that even young children intuitively develop. Advancing beyond pattern recognition requires dynamic, interpretable frameworks inspired by Piaget's cognitive development theory. We highlight six key research areas -- physics-informed learning, neurosymbolic learning, continual learning, causal inference, human-in-the-loop AI, and responsible AI -- as essential for enabling true reasoning in AI. By integrating statistical learning with advances in these areas, AI can evolve from pattern recognition to genuine understanding, adaptation and reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

However, achieving high geometric precision and editability requires representing figures as graphics programs in languages like TikZ, and aligned training data (i.e., graphics programs with captions) remains scarce. Meanwhile, large amounts of unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images are more readily available. We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o. Our code, datasets, and select models are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/potamides/DeTikZify</p></details> |

Inspired by neuroscience, recent work suggests that to succeed on both formal and functional linguistic tasks, LLMs should use different mechanisms for each; such localization could either be built-in or emerge spontaneously through training. In this paper, we ask: do current models, with fast-improving functional linguistic abilities, exhibit distinct localization of formal and functional linguistic mechanisms? We answer this by finding and comparing the "circuits", or minimal computational subgraphs, responsible for various formal and functional tasks. Comparing 5 LLMs across 10 distinct tasks, we find that while there is indeed little overlap between circuits for formal and functional tasks, there is also little overlap between formal linguistic tasks, as exists in the human brain. Thus, a single formal linguistic network, unified and distinct from functional task circuits, remains elusive. However, in terms of cross-task faithfulness - the ability of one circuit to solve another's task - we observe a separation between formal and functional mechanisms, suggesting that shared mechanisms between formal tasks may exist.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables.

Unfortunately, existing approaches either are overly restrictive, assuming the absence of hidden confounders, or lack generality, being tailored to a particular query and graph. In this work, we introduce DeCaFlow, a CGM that accounts for hidden confounders in a single amortized training process using only observational data and the causal graph. Importantly, DeCaFlow can provably identify all causal queries with a valid adjustment set or sufficiently informative proxy variables. Remarkably, for the first time to our knowledge, we show that a confounded counterfactual query is identifiable, and thus solvable by DeCaFlow, as long as its interventional counterpart is as well. Our empirical results on diverse settings (including the Ecoli70 dataset, with 3 independent hidden confounders, tens of observed variables and hundreds of causal queries) show that DeCaFlow outperforms existing approaches, while demonstrating its out-of-the-box flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 22 figures.

Among these descriptors, GeDi has demonstrated strong zero-shot 6D pose estimation capabilities but remains computationally impractical for real-world applications due to its expensive inference process. \textit{Can we retain GeDi's effectiveness while significantly improving its efficiency?} In this paper, we explore this question by introducing a knowledge distillation framework that trains an efficient student model to regress local descriptors from a GeDi teacher. Our key contributions include: an efficient large-scale training procedure that ensures robustness to occlusions and partial observations while operating under compute and storage constraints, and a novel loss formulation that handles weak supervision from non-distinctive teacher descriptors. We validate our approach on five BOP Benchmark datasets and demonstrate a significant reduction in inference time while maintaining competitive performance with existing methods, bringing zero-shot 6D pose estimation closer to real-time feasibility.

LiDAR sensors, widely used for their ability to provide detailed 3D measurements, are key to achieving this capability. However, variations between training and inference data can cause significant performance drops when object detection models are employed in different sensor settings. One critical factor is beam density, as inference on sparse, cost-effective LiDAR sensors is often preferred in real-world applications. Despite previous work addressing the beam-density-induced domain gap, substantial knowledge gaps remain, particularly concerning dense 128-beam sensors in cross-domain scenarios. To gain better understanding of the impact of beam density on domain gaps, we conduct a comprehensive investigation that includes an evaluation of different object detection architectures. Our architecture evaluation reveals that combining voxel- and point-based approaches yields superior cross-domain performance by leveraging the strengths of both representations. Building on these findings, we analyze beam-density-induced domain gaps and argue that these domain gaps must be evaluated in conjunction with other domain shifts. Contrary to conventional beliefs, our experiments reveal that detectors benefit from training on denser data and exhibit robustness to beam density variations during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVWW 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore utilizing visual signals as a new interface for models to interact with the environment. Specifically, we choose videos as a representative visual signal. And by training autoregressive Transformers on video datasets in a self-supervised objective, we find that the model emerges a zero-shot capability to infer the semantics from a demonstration video, and imitate the semantics to an unseen scenario. This allows the models to perform unseen tasks by watching the demonstration video in an in-context manner, without further fine-tuning. To validate the imitation capacity, we design various evaluation metrics including both objective and subjective measures. The results show that our models can generate high-quality video clips that accurately align with the semantic guidance provided by the demonstration videos, and we also show that the imitation capacity follows the scaling law. Code and models have been open-sourced.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved fast progress in this domain, existing approaches either demand significant computational resources or struggle with effective multi-modal integration. In this paper, we introduce DocLayLLM, an efficient multi-modal extension of LLMs specifically designed for TDU. By lightly integrating visual patch tokens and 2D positional tokens into LLMs' input and encoding the document content using the LLMs themselves, we fully take advantage of the document comprehension capability of LLMs and enhance their perception of OCR information. We have also deeply considered the role of chain-of-thought (CoT) and innovatively proposed the techniques of CoT Pre-training and CoT Annealing. Our DocLayLLM can achieve remarkable performances with lightweight training settings, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our DocLayLLM outperforms existing OCR-dependent methods and OCR-free competitors.

To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data. We believe DEIM sets a new baseline for advancements in real-time object detection. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ShihuaHuang95/DEIM.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, despite this growing interest, it remains under-explored in 3D data, where approaches rely exclusively on 3D motion, despite its several challenges. In this paper, we present a novel framework that leverages advances in 2D object discovery which are based on 2D motion to exploit the advantages of such motion cues being more flexible and generalizable and to bridge the gap between 2D and 3D modalities. Our primary contributions are twofold: (i) we introduce DIOD-3D, the first baseline for multi-object discovery in 3D data using 2D motion, incorporating scene completion as an auxiliary task to enable dense object localization from sparse input data; (ii) we develop xMOD, a cross-modal training framework that integrates 2D and 3D data while always using 2D motion cues. xMOD employs a teacher-student training paradigm across the two modalities to mitigate confirmation bias by leveraging the domain gap. During inference, the model supports both RGB-only and point cloud-only inputs. Additionally, we propose a late-fusion technique tailored to our pipeline that further enhances performance when both modalities are available at inference. We evaluate our approach extensively on synthetic (TRIP-PD) and challenging real-world datasets (KITTI and Waymo). Notably, our approach yields a substantial performance improvement compared with the 2D object discovery state-of-the-art on all datasets with gains ranging from +8.7 to +15.1 in F1@50 score.

Unfortunately, current pioneering 4D-PSG research can primarily suffer from data scarcity issues severely, as well as the resulting out-of-vocabulary problems; also, the pipeline nature of the benchmark generation method can lead to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, this paper investigates a novel framework for 4D-PSG generation that leverages rich 2D visual scene annotations to enhance 4D scene learning. First, we introduce a 4D Large Language Model (4D-LLM) integrated with a 3D mask decoder for end-to-end generation of 4D-PSG. A chained SG inference mechanism is further designed to exploit LLMs' open-vocabulary capabilities to infer accurate and comprehensive object and relation labels iteratively. Most importantly, we propose a 2D-to-4D visual scene transfer learning framework, where a spatial-temporal scene transcending strategy effectively transfers dimension-invariant features from abundant 2D SG annotations to 4D scenes, effectively compensating for data scarcity in 4D-PSG. Extensive experiments on the benchmark data demonstrate that we strikingly outperform baseline models by a large margin, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

In a distributed setup with multiple sensors, each individual sensor knows its own observation and can determine its freshness, as measured by Age of Incorrect Information (AoII). This local knowledge is suited for distributed medium access, where the transmission strategies have to deal with collisions. We present Dynamic Epistemic Logic for Tracking Anomalies (DELTA), a medium access protocol that limits collisions and minimizes AoII in anomaly reporting over dense networks. Each sensor knows its own AoII, while it can compute the belief about the AoII for all other sensors, based on their Age of Information (AoI), which is inferred from the acknowledgments. This results in a goal-oriented approach based on dynamic epistemic logic emerging from public information. We analyze the resulting DELTA protocol both from a theoretical standpoint and with Monte Carlo simulations, showing that it is significantly more efficient and robust than classical random access, while outperforming state-of-the-art scheduled schemes by at least 30%, even with imperfect feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version: to be presented at IEEE INFOCOM 2025.

| **[Inferring diffusivity from killed diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14978v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider diffusion of independent molecules in an insulated Euclidean domain with unknown diffusivity parameter. At a random time and position, the molecules may bind and stop diffusing in dependence of a given `binding potential'. The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional corresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov process. We study the problem of conducting inference on the infinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing' positions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson point process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a certain Schr\"odinger equation. The inference problem can then be re-cast as a non-linear inverse problem for this PDE, which we show to be consistently solvable in a Bayesian way under natural conditions on the initial state of the diffusion, provided the binding potential is not too `aggressive'. In the course of our proofs we obtain novel posterior contraction rate results for high-dimensional Poisson count data that are of independent interest. A numerical illustration of the algorithm by standard MCMC methods is also provided.</p></details> | 30 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Principled Approach to Bayesian Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19796v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Updating $\textit{a priori}$ information given some observed data is the core tenet of Bayesian inference. Bayesian transfer learning extends this idea by incorporating information from a related dataset to improve the inference on the observed data which may have been collected under slightly different settings. The use of related information can be useful when the observed data is scarce, for example. Current Bayesian transfer learning methods that are based on the so-called $\textit{power prior}$ can adaptively transfer information from related data. Unfortunately, it is not always clear under which scenario Bayesian transfer learning performs best or even if it will improve Bayesian inference. Additionally, current power prior methods rely on conjugacy to evaluate the posterior of interest. We propose using leave-one-out cross validation on the target dataset as a means of evaluating Bayesian transfer learning methods. Further, we introduce a new framework, $\textit{transfer sequential Monte Carlo}$, for power prior approaches that efficiently chooses the transfer parameter while avoiding the need for conjugate priors. We assess the performance of our proposed methods in two comprehensive simulation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

The task plays an important role in robotics because PCS enables robots to understand their physical environments directly. To process sparse and large-scale outdoor point clouds in real time, range image-based models are commonly adopted. However, in a range image, the lack of explicit depth information inevitably causes some separate objects in 3D space to touch each other, bringing difficulty for the range image-based models in correctly segmenting the objects. Moreover, previous PCS models are usually derived from the existing color image-based models and unable to make full use of the implicit but ordered depth information inherent in the range image, thereby achieving inferior performance. In this paper, we propose Depth-Aware Module (DAM) and Fast FMVNet V3. DAM perceives the ordered depth information in the range image by explicitly modelling the interdependence among channels. Fast FMVNet V3 incorporates DAM by integrating it into the last block in each architecture stage. Extensive experiments conducted on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and SemanticPOSS demonstrate that DAM brings a significant improvement for Fast FMVNet V3 with negligible computational cost.</p></details> | No Comments |
| **[Next Patch Prediction for Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15321v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models, built based on the Next Token Prediction (NTP) paradigm, show great potential in developing a unified framework that integrates both language and vision tasks. Pioneering works introduce NTP to autoregressive visual generation tasks. In this work, we rethink the NTP for autoregressive image generation and extend it to a novel Next Patch Prediction (NPP) paradigm. Our key idea is to group and aggregate image tokens into patch tokens with higher information density. By using patch tokens as a more compact input sequence, the autoregressive model is trained to predict the next patch, significantly reducing computational costs. To further exploit the natural hierarchical structure of image data, we propose a multi-scale coarse-to-fine patch grouping strategy. With this strategy, the training process begins with a large patch size and ends with vanilla NTP where the patch size is 1$\times$1, thus maintaining the original inference process without modifications. Extensive experiments across a diverse range of model sizes demonstrate that NPP could reduce the training cost to around 0.6 times while improving image generation quality by up to 1.0 FID score on the ImageNet 256x256 generation benchmark. Notably, our method retains the original autoregressive model architecture without introducing additional trainable parameters or specifically designing a custom image tokenizer, offering a flexible and plug-and-play solution for enhancing autoregressive visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Next-Patch-Prediction, v2: add related work "Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models", v3: Add content</p></details> |

The diffusion model integrates regularization terms that encourage smooth, collision-free trajectories during training, and trajectory optimization refines the generated seed trajectories to correct any colliding segments. Our experimental results demonstrate that high-quality trajectory priors, learned through our C-space-grounded diffusion model, enable the efficient generation of collision-free trajectories in narrow-passage environments, outperforming previous learning- and planning-based baselines.

By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Framework for Statistical Inference via Randomized Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11255v4)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized algorithms, such as randomized sketching or stochastic optimization, are a promising approach to ease the computational burden in analyzing large datasets. However, randomized algorithms also produce non-deterministic outputs, leading to the problem of evaluating their accuracy. In this paper, we develop a statistical inference framework for quantifying the uncertainty of the outputs of randomized algorithms. Our key conclusion is that one can perform statistical inference for the target of a sequence of randomized algorithms as long as in the limit, their outputs fluctuate around the target according to any (possibly unknown) probability distribution. In this setting, we develop appropriate statistical inference methods -- sub-randomization, multi-run plug-in and multi-run aggregation -- by estimating the unknown parameters of the limiting distribution either using multiple runs of the randomized algorithm, or by tailored estimates. As illustrations, we develop methods for statistical inference when using stochastic optimization (such as Polyak-Ruppert averaging in stochastic gradient descent and stochastic optimization with momentum). We also illustrate our methods in inference for least squares parameters via randomized sketching, by characterizing the limiting distributions of sketching estimates in a possibly growing dimensional case. We also characterize the computation and communication cost of our methods, showing that in certain cases, they add negligible overhead. The results are supported via a broad range of simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main change in V4 is by adding more examples that the proposed framework applies to, including stochastic optimization and iterative sketching, in Section 3.

| **[Interpretable High-order Knowledge Graph Neural Network for Predicting Synthetic Lethality in Human Cancers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06052v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic lethality (SL) is a promising gene interaction for cancer therapy. Recent SL prediction methods integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) and employ attention mechanisms to extract local subgraphs as explanations for target gene pairs. However, attention mechanisms often lack fidelity, typically generate a single explanation per gene pair, and fail to ensure trustworthy high-order structures in their explanations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Diverse Graph Information Bottleneck for Synthetic Lethality (DGIB4SL), a KG-based GNN that generates multiple faithful explanations for the same gene pair and effectively encodes high-order structures. Specifically, we introduce a novel DGIB objective, integrating a Determinant Point Process (DPP) constraint into the standard IB objective, and employ 13 motif-based adjacency matrices to capture high-order structures in gene representations. Experimental results show that DGIB4SL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and provides multiple explanations for SL prediction, revealing diverse biological mechanisms underlying SL inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

| **[Communication-Efficient Distributed On-Device LLM Inference Over Wireless Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14882v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various application domains, but their enormous sizes and computational demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed on-device LLM inference framework that leverages tensor parallelism to partition the neural network tensors (e.g., weight matrices) of one LLM across multiple edge devices for collaborative inference. A key challenge in tensor parallelism is the frequent all-reduce operations for aggregating intermediate layer outputs across participating devices, which incurs significant communication overhead. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose an over-the-air computation (AirComp) approach that harnesses the analog superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels to perform fast all-reduce steps. To utilize the heterogeneous computational capabilities of edge devices and mitigate communication distortions, we investigate a joint model assignment and transceiver optimization problem to minimize the average transmission error. The resulting mixed-timescale stochastic non-convex optimization problem is intractable, and we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm to solve it. Moreover, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to a stationary point of the original problem. Comprehensive simulation results will show that the proposed framework outperforms existing benchmark schemes, achieving up to 5x inference speed acceleration and improving inference accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.12559</p></details> |

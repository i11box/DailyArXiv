| **[Dataset Distillation for Pre-Trained Self-Supervised Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16674v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025.

| **[EvoLMM: Self-Evolving Large Multimodal Models with Continuous Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16672v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/EvoLMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 Pag...</summary><p>9 Pages, 6 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Video-as-Answer: Predict and Generate Next Video Event with Joint-GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16669v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-as-answer.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[V-ReasonBench: Toward Unified Reasoning Benchmark Suite for Video Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16668v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in generative video models, such as Veo-3, has shown surprising zero-shot reasoning abilities, creating a growing need for systematic and reliable evaluation. We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://oahzxl.github.io/VReasonBench</p></details> |
| **[SceneDesigner: Controllable Multi-Object Image Generation with 9-DoF Pose Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16666v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/FudanCVL/SceneDesigner.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight), Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/SceneDesigner/</p></details> |
| **[TriDiff-4D: Fast 4D Generation through Diffusion-based Triplane Re-posing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16662v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, Under review at a conference</p></details> |
| **[Cognitive Foundations for Reasoning and Their Manifestation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16660v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[PartUV: Part-Based UV Unwrapping of 3D Meshes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16659v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

| **[Solving Spatial Supersensing Without Spatial Supersensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16655v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity</p></details> | Tech Report |
| **[LightFusion: A Light-weighted, Double Fusion Framework for Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22946v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and (2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Evolution Strategies at the Hyperscale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16652v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 12 figures, Website at https://eshyperscale.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Teacher-Guided One-Shot Pruning via Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16653v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2025)</p></details> |
| **[LLMInit: A Free Lunch from Large Language Models for Selective Initialization of Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01814v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) is widely adopted in industrial recommender systems (RecSys) for modeling user-item interactions across numerous applications, but often struggles with cold-start and data-sparse scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with rich semantic knowledge, offer promising solutions to these challenges. However, deploying LLMs at scale is hindered by their significant computational demands and latency. In this paper, we propose a novel and scalable LLM-RecSys framework, LLMInit, designed to integrate pretrained LLM embeddings into CF models through selective initialization strategies. Specifically, we identify the embedding collapse issue observed when CF models scale and match the large embedding sizes in LLMs and avoid the problem by introducing efficient sampling methods, including, random, uniform, and variance-based selections. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that LLMInit significantly improves recommendation performance while maintaining low computational costs, offering a practical and scalable solution for industrial applications. To facilitate industry adoption and promote future research, we provide open-source access to our implementation at https://github.com/DavidZWZ/LLMInit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Researchers are now exploring their potential as universal acoustic feature extractors for a broader range of speech processing tasks. Building on this trend, we introduce Codec2Vec, the first speech representation learning framework that relies exclusively on discrete audio codec units. This approach offers several advantages, including improved data storage and transmission efficiency, faster training, and enhanced data privacy. We explore masked prediction with various training target derivation strategies to thoroughly understand the effectiveness of this framework. Evaluated on the SUPERB benchmark, Codec2Vec achieves competitive performance compared to continuous-input models while reducing storage requirements by up to 16.5x and training time by 2.3x, showcasing its scalability and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at ASRU 2025</p></details> |
| **[Faster Certified Symmetry Breaking Using Orders With Auxiliary Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16637v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symmetry breaking is a crucial technique in modern combinatorial solving, but it is difficult to be sure it is implemented correctly. The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifying symmetry reasoning within the proof, but developing efficient methods for this has remained a long-standing open challenge. A fully general approach was recently proposed by Bogaerts et al. (2023), but it relies on encoding lexicographic orders with big integers, which quickly becomes infeasible for large symmetries. In this work, we develop a method for instead encoding orders with auxiliary variables. We show that this leads to orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in both theory and practice by running experiments on proof logging and checking for SAT symmetry breaking using the state-of-the-art satsuma symmetry breaker and the VeriPB proof checking toolchain.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

| **[Modular Jump Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15557v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes (GPs) furnish accurate nonlinear predictions with well-calibrated uncertainty. However, the typical GP setup has a built-in stationarity assumption, making it ill-suited for modeling data from processes with sudden changes, or "jumps" in the output variable. The "jump GP" (JGP) was developed for modeling data from such processes, combining local GPs and latent "level" variables under a joint inferential framework. But joint modeling can be fraught with difficulty. We aim to simplify by suggesting a more modular setup, eschewing joint inference but retaining the main JGP themes: (a) learning optimal neighborhood sizes that locally respect manifolds of discontinuity; and (b) a new cluster-based (latent) feature to capture regions of distinct output levels on both sides of the manifold. We show that each of (a) and (b) separately leads to dramatic improvements when modeling processes with jumps. In tandem (but without requiring joint inference) that benefit is compounded, as illustrated on real and synthetic benchmark examples from the recent literature.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://ai.meta.com/sam3d/</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms and Transformers for background determination in particle physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14894v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic method exists. This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective, we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token sequences representing decays.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

Our main result is that for each magnetization $η$, the free energy density of the fixed-magnetization Ising model converges to the annealed free energy density, itself the Bethe free energy of an Ising measure on the infinite $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the fixed-magnetization Ising model exhibits local weak convergence to this tree measure. A key challenge to proving these results is that for magnetizations between the model's spinodal points, the limiting tree measure corresponds to an unstable fixed point of the belief propagation equations. As an application, we prove that the positive-temperature Zdeborová--Boettcher conjecture on max-cut and min-bisection holds up to the reconstruction threshold: on the random $d$-regular graph, the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model plus the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the zero-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model equals $1+o(1)$. A second application is completely determining the large deviation rate function for the magnetization in the Ising model on the random regular graph up to reconstruction. Finally, we use the precise understanding of this rate function to show that the Glauber dynamics for the full Ising model on the random graph mixes in sub-exponential time from uniformly random initialization, well into the non-uniqueness regime where the worst-case initialization mixing time is exponentially slow.</p></details> | 51 pages, 2 figures |
| **[SAM2S: Segment Anything in Surgical Videos via Semantic Long-term Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16618v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its considerable impact on improving text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral presentation at ICLR 2025.

And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 5.7%, achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We also show this for Edit Flows, which falls outside of Generator Matching. That the loss can depend on $t$ clarifies that time-dependent loss weighting schemes, often used in practice to stabilize training, are theoretically justified when the specific flow or diffusion scheme is a special case of Generator Matching (or Edit Flows). It also often simplifies the construction of $X_1$-predictor schemes, which are sometimes preferred for model-related reasons. We show examples that rely upon the dependence of linear parameterizations, and of the Bregman divergence loss, on $t$ and $X_t$.</p></details> | 19 pages, 0 figures |

As AI models enter high-stakes sectors, private actors such as auditors, insurers, certification bodies, and procurement agencies require standardized evaluation metrics to assess trustworthiness. However, current XAI evaluation metrics remain fragmented and prone to manipulation, which undermines accountability and compliance. We argue that standardized metrics can function as governance primitives, embedding auditability and accountability within AI systems for effective private oversight. Building upon prior work in XAI benchmarking, we identify key limitations in ensuring faithfulness, tamper resistance, and regulatory alignment. Furthermore, interpretability can directly support model alignment by providing a verifiable means of ensuring behavioral integrity in General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems. This connection between interpretability and alignment positions XAI metrics as both technical and regulatory instruments that help prevent alignment faking, a growing concern among oversight bodies. We propose a Governance by Metrics paradigm that treats explainability evaluation as a central mechanism of private AI governance. Our framework introduces a hierarchical model linking transparency, tamper resistance, scalability, and legal alignment, extending evaluation from model introspection toward systemic accountability. Through conceptual synthesis and alignment with governance standards, we outline a roadmap for integrating explainability metrics into continuous AI assurance pipelines that serve both private oversight and regulatory needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at first EurIPS Workshop on Private AI Governance</p></details> |

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xuboshen.github.io/TimeViper</p></details> |

We include synthetic hypergrids, multiple sequence generation environments with various editing regimes and particular reward designs for molecular generation, phylogenetic tree construction, Bayesian structure learning, and sampling from the Ising model energy. Across different tasks, gfnx achieves significant wall-clock speedups compared to Pytorch-based benchmarks (such as torchgfn library) and author implementations. For example, gfnx achieves up to 55 times speedup on CPU-based sequence generation environments, and up to 80 times speedup with the GPU-based Bayesian network structure learning setup. Our package provides a diverse set of benchmarks and aims to standardize empirical evaluation and accelerate research and applications of GFlowNets.

Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees. These results provide stronger theoretical foundations for differentially private optimization and suggest that, despite privacy-induced distortions, the algorithm remains pathwise stable in both convex and nonconvex regimes.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Private governance mechanisms audits, certification, insurance, and procurement are emerging to complement public regulation, but they require technical substrates that generate verifiable causal evidence about model behavior. This paper argues that mechanistic interpretability provides this substrate. We frame interpretability not as post-hoc explanation but as a design constraint embedding auditability, provenance, and bounded transparency within model architectures. Integrating causal abstraction theory and empirical benchmarks such as MIB and LoBOX, we outline how interpretability-first models can underpin private assurance pipelines and role-calibrated transparency frameworks. This reframing situates interpretability as infrastructure for private AI governance bridging the gap between technical reliability and institutional accountability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the first EurIPS Workshop on Private AI Governance</p></details> |

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, successful in natural language processing and 2D vision tasks, would underperform when naively applied to 3D point cloud models due to significant geometric and spatial distribution shifts. Existing PEFT methods commonly treat points as orderless tokens, neglecting important local spatial structures and global geometric contexts in 3D modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Geometric Encoding Mixer (GEM), a novel geometry-aware PEFT module specifically designed for 3D point cloud transformers. GEM explicitly integrates fine-grained local positional encodings with a lightweight latent attention mechanism to capture comprehensive global context, thereby effectively addressing the spatial and geometric distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEM achieves performance comparable to or sometimes even exceeding full fine-tuning, while only updating 1.6% of the model's parameters, fewer than other PEFT methods. With significantly reduced training time and memory requirements, our approach thus sets a new benchmark for efficient, scalable, and geometry-aware fine-tuning of large-scale 3D point cloud models.

| **[New Hardness Results for the LOCAL Model via a Simple Self-Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19972v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Very recently, Khoury and Schild [FOCS 2025] showed that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves maximal matching requires $Ω(\min\{\log Δ, \log_Δn\})$ rounds, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph and $Δ$ is the maximum degree. This result is shown through a new technique, called round elimination via self-reduction. The lower bound proof is beautiful and presents very nice ideas. However, it spans more than 25 pages of technical details, and hence it is hard to digest and generalize to other problems. Historically, the simplification of proofs and techniques has marked an important turning point in our understanding of the complexity of graph problems. Our paper makes a step forward towards this direction, and provides the following contributions. 1. We present a short and simplified version of the round elimination via self-reduction technique. The simplification of this technique enables us to obtain the following two hardness results. 2. We show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that solves the maximal $b$-matching problem requires $Ω(\min\{\log_{1+b}Δ, \log_Δn\})$ and $Ω(\sqrt{\log_{1+b} n})$ rounds. We recall that the $b$-matching problem is a generalization of the matching problem where each vertex can have up to $b$ incident edges in the matching. As a corollary, for $b=1$, we obtain a short proof for the maximal matching lower bound shown by Khoury and Schild. 3. Finally, we show that any randomized LOCAL algorithm that properly colors the edges of a graph with $Δ+ k$ colors requires $Ω(\min\{\log Δ, \log_Δn\})$ and $Ω(\sqrt{\log n})$ rounds, for any $k\le Δ^{1-\varepsilon}$ and any constant $\varepsilon > 0$.</p></details> | 21 pages, no figures |
| **[Integrating Symbolic Natural Language Understanding and Language Models for Word Sense Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16577v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (main technical track), extended version</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Predictive Performance on Tabular Data through Data Augmentation with Latent-Space Flow-Based Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16571v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Severe class imbalance is common in real-world tabular learning, where rare but important minority classes are essential for reliable prediction. Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.</p></details> | 35 Pages |

Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

In this work, we present NutriScreener, a retrieval-augmented, multi-pose graph attention network that combines CLIP-based visual embeddings, class-boosted knowledge retrieval, and context awareness to enable robust malnutrition detection and anthropometric prediction from children's images, simultaneously addressing generalizability and class imbalance. In a clinical study, doctors rated it 4.3/5 for accuracy and 4.6/5 for efficiency, confirming its deployment readiness in low-resource settings. Trained and tested on 2,141 children from AnthroVision and additionally evaluated on diverse cross-continent populations, including ARAN and an in-house collected CampusPose dataset, it achieves 0.79 recall, 0.82 AUC, and significantly lower anthropometric RMSEs, demonstrating reliable measurement in unconstrained pediatric settings. Cross-dataset results show up to 25% recall gain and up to 3.5 cm RMSE reduction using demographically matched knowledge bases.

These models produce embeddings that can be used as analysis-ready datasets, enabling the modelling of ecosystem dynamics without extensive sensor-specific preprocessing. However, existing models typically operate at fixed spatial or temporal scales, limiting their use for ecological analyses that require both fine spatial detail and high temporal fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a representation learning framework that integrates different EO modalities into a unified feature space at high spatio-temporal resolution. We introduce the framework using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as representative modalities. Our approach produces a latent space at native 10 m resolution and the temporal frequency of cloud-free Sentinel-2 acquisitions. Each sensor is first modeled independently to capture its sensor-specific characteristics. Their representations are then combined into a shared model. This two-stage design enables modality-specific optimisation and easy extension to new sensors, retaining pretrained encoders while retraining only fusion layers. This enables the model to capture complementary remote sensing data and to preserve coherence across space and time. Qualitative analyses reveal that the learned embeddings exhibit high spatial and semantic consistency across heterogeneous landscapes. Quantitative evaluation in modelling Gross Primary Production reveals that they encode ecologically meaningful patterns and retain sufficient temporal fidelity to support fine-scale analyses. Overall, the proposed framework provides a flexible, analysis-ready representation learning approach for environmental applications requiring diverse spatial and temporal resolutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (incliding 2 pages of references), 7 figures</p></details> |

However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work aims to continuously expand to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an Oral Presentation at AAAI 2026 Main Technical Track (this version is not peer-reviewed; it is the extended version)</p></details> |

While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power. We propose a post-generation selection procedure that improves calibration, highlighting both progress and open challenges for generative survival modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>P.

Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2025 (WS#44: Biological ontologies and knowledge bases (BiOK) in the LLM era)</p></details> |

We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 4 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2025)</p></details> |

Researchers are now exploring their potential as universal acoustic feature extractors for a broader range of speech processing tasks. Building on this trend, we introduce Codec2Vec, the first speech representation learning framework that relies exclusively on discrete audio codec units.

| **[Leveraging Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms and Transformers for background determination in particle physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14894v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic method exists. This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective, we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token sequences representing decays.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its considerable impact on improving text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral presentation at ICLR 2025.

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xuboshen.github.io/TimeViper</p></details> |

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, successful in natural language processing and 2D vision tasks, would underperform when naively applied to 3D point cloud models due to significant geometric and spatial distribution shifts. Existing PEFT methods commonly treat points as orderless tokens, neglecting important local spatial structures and global geometric contexts in 3D modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Geometric Encoding Mixer (GEM), a novel geometry-aware PEFT module specifically designed for 3D point cloud transformers. GEM explicitly integrates fine-grained local positional encodings with a lightweight latent attention mechanism to capture comprehensive global context, thereby effectively addressing the spatial and geometric distribution mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEM achieves performance comparable to or sometimes even exceeding full fine-tuning, while only updating 1.6% of the model's parameters, fewer than other PEFT methods. With significantly reduced training time and memory requirements, our approach thus sets a new benchmark for efficient, scalable, and geometry-aware fine-tuning of large-scale 3D point cloud models.

| **[A $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the general scheduling problem in quasipolynomial time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16536v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the general scheduling problem (GSP) which generalizes and unifies several well-studied preemptive single-machine scheduling problems, such as weighted flow time, weighted sum of completion time, and minimizing the total weight of tardy jobs. We are given a set of jobs with their processing times and release times and seek to compute a (possibly preemptive) schedule for them on one machine. Each job incurs a cost that depends on its completion time in the computed schedule, as given by a separate job-dependent cost function for each job, and our objective is to minimize the total resulting cost of all jobs. The best known result for GSP is a polynomial time $O(\log\log P)$-approximation algorithm [Bansal and Pruhs, FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014]. We give a quasi-polynomial time $(2+ε)$-approximation algorithm for GSP, assuming that the jobs' processing times are quasi-polynomially bounded integers. For the special case of the weighted tardiness objective, we even obtain an improved approximation ratio of $1+ε$. For this case, no better result had been known than the mentioned $O(\log\log P)$-approximation for the general case of GSP. Our algorithms use a reduction to an auxiliary geometric covering problem. In contrast to a related reduction for the special case of weighted flow time [Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2021][Armbruster, Rohwedder, Wiese, STOC 2023] for GSP it seems no longer possible to establish a tree-like structure for the rectangles to guide an algorithm that solves this geometric problem. Despite the lack of structure due to the problem itself, we show that an optimal solution can be transformed into a near-optimal solution that has certain structural properties. Due to those we can guess a substantial part of the solution quickly and partition the remaining problem in an intricate way, such that we can independently solve each part recursively.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in SODA 2026</p></details> |

However, current workflows often do not provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units, which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators, weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[A Comparison Between Decision Transformers and Traditional Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16475v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to derive effective policies from pre-collected datasets without active environment interaction. While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, published in the Proceedings of the 46th Annual conference of the South African Institute of Computer Scientists and Information Technologists (SIACSIT 2025)</p></details> |

However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\% compared with KIVI-KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

While current slicing technologies offer advanced support strategies, they focus on post-processing optimizations rather than addressing the underlying need for support-efficient design during the model generation phase. This paper introduces SEG (\textit{\underline{S}upport-\underline{E}ffective \underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time. We demonstrate SEG's effectiveness through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, Thingi10k-Val and GPT-3DP-Val, showing that SEG significantly outperforms baseline models such as TRELLIS, DPO, and DRO in terms of support volume reduction and printability. Qualitative results further reveal that SEG maintains high fidelity to input prompts while minimizing the need for support structures. Our findings highlight the potential of SEG to transform 3D printing by directly optimizing models during the generative process, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient digital fabrication practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (7 pages)</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Surgical Scene Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16430v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses. Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks. Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures. Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic speed, volume, and flow datasets demonstrate that FreqFlow achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, on average 7\% RMSE improvements, while being significantly faster and more parameter-efficient than existing methods</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EurIPS, 2025</p></details> |

However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 26:main technical track Oral</p></details> |

By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Specifically, we focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting. For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper at NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare.</p></details> | 2 Figures, 1 Table |

However, existing decoding models often mix common and personalized components, leading to interference from individual variability that limits cross-subject decoding performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a system filter that extends the concept of signal filtering to the system level. The method expands a system into its spectral representation, selectively removes unnecessary components, and reconstructs the system from the retained target components, thereby achieving explicit system-level decomposition and filtering. We further integrate the system filter into a Cross-Subject Decoding framework based on the System Filter (CSD-SF) and evaluate it on the four-class motor imagery (MI) task of the BCIC IV 2a dataset. Personalized models are transformed into relation spectrums, and statistical testing across subjects is used to remove personalized components. The remaining stable relations, representing common components across subjects, are then used to construct a common model for cross-subject decoding. Experimental results show an average improvement of 3.28% in decoding accuracy over baseline methods, demonstrating that the proposed system filter effectively isolates stable common components and enhances model robustness and generalizability in cross-subject EEG decoding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[NaTex: Seamless Texture Generation as Latent Color Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16317v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network. We compare our method with the InEKF and the KalmanNet approaches on datasets obtained from the humanoid robot RH5. The results indicate the potential of Transformers in humanoid state estimation, but also highlight the need for robust autoregressive training in these high-dimensional problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The 22nd International Conference on Advanced Robotics (ICAR 2025)</p></details> |

However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages of main text and 10 pages of appendices</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Fairness-aware Interactive Recommendation: Item Lifecycle as a Control Knob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16248v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[FT-NCFM: An Influence-Aware Data Distillation Framework for Efficient VLA Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16233v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful generalization of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is bottlenecked by their heavy reliance on massive, redundant, and unevenly valued datasets, hindering their widespread application. Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%. Our work demonstrates that intelligent data distillation is a highly promising new path for building efficient, high-performance VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |

To address this, we propose PIPHEN, an innovative distributed physical cognition-control framework. Its core idea is to replace "raw data communication" with "semantic communication" by performing "semantic distillation" at the robot edge, reconstructing high-dimensional perceptual data into compact, structured physical representations. This idea is primarily realized through two key components: (1) a novel Physical Interaction Prediction Network (PIPN), derived from large model knowledge distillation, to generate this representation; and (2) a Hamiltonian Energy Network (HEN) controller, based on energy conservation, to precisely translate this representation into coordinated actions. Experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, PIPHEN can compress the information representation to less than 5% of the original data volume and reduce collaborative decision-making latency from 315ms to 76ms, while significantly improving task success rates. This work provides a fundamentally efficient paradigm for resolving the "shared brain dilemma" in resource-constrained multi-robot systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |
| **[TRADES: Generating Realistic Market Simulations with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical noise, nonlinearity, volatility, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely hard. Here, we address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and testing trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and generating synthetic market data. We propose a novel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB Simulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows as time series conditioned on the state of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There is a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market simulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the predictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, to market data by training a stock price predictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare TRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting a 3.27 and 3.48 improvement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we generate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. Furthermore, we assess TRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it effectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to an experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations of trading strategies and market impact experiments. To perform the experiments, we developed DeepMarket, the first open-source Python framework for LOB market simulation with deep learning. In our repository, we include a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's generated simulations.</p></details> | 8 pages |

While vast quantities of zero-carbon energy are routinely curtailed, today's centralized datacenter architectures remain poorly matched to this reality in both energy proportionality and geographic flexibility. This work envisions a shift toward a distributed fabric of renewable-powered micro-datacenters that dynamically follow the availability of surplus green energy through live workload migration. At the core of this vision lies a formal feasibility-domain model that delineates when migratory AI computation is practically achievable. By explicitly linking checkpoint size, wide-area bandwidth, and renewable-window duration, the model reveals that migration is almost always energetically justified, and that time-not energy-is the dominant constraint shaping feasibility. This insight enables the design of a feasibility-aware orchestration framework that transforms migration from a best-effort heuristic into a principled control mechanism. Trace-driven evaluation shows that such orchestration can simultaneously reduce non-renewable energy use and improve performance stability, overcoming the tradeoffs of purely energy-driven strategies. Beyond the immediate feasibility analysis, the extended version explores the architectural horizon of renewable-aware AI infrastructures. It examines the role of emerging ultra-efficient GPU-enabled edge platforms, anticipates integration with grid-level control and demand-response ecosystems, and outlines paths toward supporting partially migratable and distributed workloads. The work positions feasibility-aware migration as a foundational building block for a future computing paradigm in which AI execution becomes fluid, geographically adaptive, and aligned with renewable energy availability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a paper submitted - v01 November 2025</p></details> |

A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-26)</p></details> |
| **[Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation for Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16156v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have shown exceptional performance in image generation, yet their large parameter counts incur high computational costs, impeding deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments. The open-source code, checkpoints for PPCL can be found at the following link: https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/Qwen-Image-Pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/Qwen-Image-Pruning</p></details> |

We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM, enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing single-agent end-to-end pipelines are often constrained by occlusion and limited perception range, resulting in hazardous driving. Furthermore, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of the driving behavior, leading to an untrustworthiness system. To address these limitations, we introduce Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM) and propose an interpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns directly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal representation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for downstream planning. RiskMM first constructs a multi-agent spatiotemporal representation with unified Transformer-based architecture, then derives risk-aware representations by modeling interactions among surrounding environments with attention. These representations are subsequently fed into a learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) module. The MPC planner inherently accommodates physical constraints and different vehicle types and can provide interpretation by aligning learned parameters with explicit MPC elements. Evaluations conducted on the real-world V2XPnP-Seq dataset confirm that RiskMM achieves superior and robust performance in risk-aware trajectory planning, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The codebase will be released to facilitate future research in this field.</p></details> | IEEE RA-L |

Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including English and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrate that our method surpasses other methods in visual quality and text fidelity.

| **[Change-of-Basis Pruning via Rotational Invariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16061v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured pruning removes entire neurons or channels, but its effectiveness depends on how importance is distributed across the representation space. Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\%$ to $70\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Artificial Intelligence and Accounting Research: A Framework and Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16055v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.</p></details> | 48 pages, 7 tables |

Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

We introduce V-ReasonBench, a benchmark designed to assess video reasoning across four key dimensions: structured problem-solving, spatial cognition, pattern-based inference, and physical dynamics. The benchmark is built from both synthetic and real-world image sequences and provides a diverse set of answer-verifiable tasks that are reproducible, scalable, and unambiguous. Evaluations of six state-of-the-art video models reveal clear dimension-wise differences, with strong variation in structured, spatial, pattern-based, and physical reasoning. We further compare video models with strong image models, analyze common hallucination behaviors, and study how video duration affects Chain-of-Frames reasoning. Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://oahzxl.github.io/VReasonBench</p></details> |

However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/FudanCVL/SceneDesigner.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight), Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/SceneDesigner/</p></details> |

Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, Under review at a conference</p></details> |
| **[Solving Spatial Supersensing Without Spatial Supersensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16655v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims.

| **[Evolution Strategies at the Hyperscale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16652v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Evolution Guided General Optimization via Low-rank Learning (EGGROLL), an evolution strategies (ES) algorithm designed to scale backprop-free optimization to large population sizes for modern large neural network architectures with billions of parameters. ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{ï}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times r},\ B\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times r}$ with $r\ll \min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)$ rate. Our experiments show that (1) EGGROLL does not compromise the performance of ES in tabula-rasa RL settings, despite being faster, (2) it is competitive with GRPO as a technique for improving LLM reasoning, and (3) EGGROLL enables stable pre-training of nonlinear recurrent language models that operate purely in integer datatypes.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 12 figures, Website at https://eshyperscale.github.io/</p></details> |

To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

However, the typical GP setup has a built-in stationarity assumption, making it ill-suited for modeling data from processes with sudden changes, or "jumps" in the output variable. The "jump GP" (JGP) was developed for modeling data from such processes, combining local GPs and latent "level" variables under a joint inferential framework. But joint modeling can be fraught with difficulty. We aim to simplify by suggesting a more modular setup, eschewing joint inference but retaining the main JGP themes: (a) learning optimal neighborhood sizes that locally respect manifolds of discontinuity; and (b) a new cluster-based (latent) feature to capture regions of distinct output levels on both sides of the manifold. We show that each of (a) and (b) separately leads to dramatic improvements when modeling processes with jumps. In tandem (but without requiring joint inference) that benefit is compounded, as illustrated on real and synthetic benchmark examples from the recent literature.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization. Code and dataset will be released at https://jinlab-imvr.github.io/SAM2S.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

We include synthetic hypergrids, multiple sequence generation environments with various editing regimes and particular reward designs for molecular generation, phylogenetic tree construction, Bayesian structure learning, and sampling from the Ising model energy. Across different tasks, gfnx achieves significant wall-clock speedups compared to Pytorch-based benchmarks (such as torchgfn library) and author implementations. For example, gfnx achieves up to 55 times speedup on CPU-based sequence generation environments, and up to 80 times speedup with the GPU-based Bayesian network structure learning setup. Our package provides a diverse set of benchmarks and aims to standardize empirical evaluation and accelerate research and applications of GFlowNets.

Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies. Using principled hyperparameter settings, we evaluate ECPv2 across a wide range of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Across benchmarks, ECPv2 consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, while significantly reducing wall-clock time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (main technical track), extended version</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Supernet Training for Efficient Visual Autoregressive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16546v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment. We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model. However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025. 10 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

To resolve this, we propose Prism, a novel decoupled framework that rigorously separates the recommendation process into a dedicated ranking stage and an explanation generation stage. Inspired by knowledge distillation, Prism leverages a powerful teacher LLM (e.g., FLAN-T5-XXL) as an Oracle to produce high-fidelity explanatory knowledge. A compact, fine-tuned student model (e.g., BART-Base), the Prism, then specializes in synthesizing this knowledge into personalized explanations. This decomposition ensures that each component is optimized for its specific objective, eliminating inherent conflicts in coupled models. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our 140M-parameter Prism model significantly outperforms its 11B-parameter teacher in human evaluations of faithfulness and personalization, while achieving a 24 times speedup and a 10 times reduction in memory consumption during inference. These results validate that decoupling, coupled with targeted distillation, provides an efficient and effective pathway to high-quality explainable recommendation.</p></details> | 11 pages,3 figures |

This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, current methods have three unsolved issues: overlooking layer-wise sensitivity to KV cache quantization, high overhead of online fine-grained decision-making, and low flexibility to different LLMs and constraints. Therefore, we theoretically analyze the inherent correlation of layer-wise transformer attention patterns to KV cache quantization errors and study why key cache is generally more important than value cache for quantization error reduction. We further propose a simple yet effective framework KVTuner to adaptively search for the optimal hardware-friendly layer-wise KV quantization precision pairs for coarse-grained KV cache with multi-objective optimization and directly utilize the offline searched configurations during online inference. To reduce the computational cost of offline calibration, we utilize the intra-layer KV precision pair pruning and inter-layer clustering to reduce the search space. Experimental results show that we can achieve nearly lossless 3.25-bit mixed precision KV cache quantization for LLMs like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and 4.0-bit for sensitive models like Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning tasks. The maximum inference throughput can be improved by 21.25\% compared with KIVI-KV8 quantization over various context lengths.

While previous research has primarily focused on white-box attacks with constrained optimizations, and transferability based black-box attacks against commercial Automatic Speech Recognition devices, this paper explores cost efficient white-box attack and non transferability black-box adversarial attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition systems, drawing insights from approaches such as Fast Gradient Sign Method and Zeroth-Order Optimization. Further, the novelty of the paper includes how poisoning attack can degrade the performances of state-of-the-art models leading to misinterpretation of audio signals. Through experimentation and analysis, we illustrate how hybrid models can generate subtle yet impactful adversarial examples with very little perturbation having Signal Noise Ratio of 35dB that can be generated within a minute. These vulnerabilities of state-of-the-art open source model have practical security implications, and emphasize the need for adversarial security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Remov...</summary><p>Remove due to conflict in authors</p></details> |

To resolve this impasse in the context of conditional independence testing, we introduce spaCRT, a closed-form saddlepoint approximation (SPA) for the distilled conditional randomization test (dCRT) that retains the statistical accuracy of dCRT's resampling while avoiding its computational cost. We prove that spaCRT's relative approximation error vanishes asymptotically by establishing a general theorem on the relative error of conditional SPAs. Because dCRT uses a plug-in nuisance regression, we specialize our guarantees to common choices: low-dimensional generalized linear model (GLM), high-dimensional GLM lasso, and kernel ridge regression. Our general theorem is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous technical tool for analyzing SPAs for resampling tests, which had previously been justified only heuristically. It extends beyond spaCRT, as we exemplify by justifying an SPA for the classical sign-flipping location test. Empirically, spaCRT matches dCRT's statistical performance by approximating its p-values with median error 1-12% across settings while delivering a 250x speedup on a single-cell CRISPR screen dataset with 85,000 hypotheses. Building on dCRT's versatility, spaCRT and its open-source R package enable fast and accurate large-scale testing across diverse applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Start...</summary><p>Starting with v3, this manuscript represents a merger of arXiv:2407.08911v2 (a previous version of this manuscript, mostly methodologically focused) and arXiv:2407.08915 (a related manuscript forming the theoretical basis of arXiv:2407.08911)</p></details> |

This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Limit...</summary><p>Limited to 5 pages and this format for IEEE PESGM conference</p></details> |
| **[AutoJudge: Judge Decoding Without Manual Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20039v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutoJudge, a method that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the response, relaxing the distribution match guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test which of the mismatches between target and draft models should be corrected to preserve quality and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time, which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final answer quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of AutoJudge with multiple draft/target model pairs on mathematical reasoning and programming benchmarks, achieving significant speedups at the cost of a minor accuracy reduction. Notably, on GSM8k with the Llama 3.1 70B target model, our approach achieves up to $\approx2\times$ speedup over speculative decoding at the cost of $\le 1\%$ drop in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, AutoJudge automatically detects programming-specific important tokens, accepting $\ge 25$ tokens per speculation cycle at $2\%$ drop in Pass@1. Our approach requires no human annotation and is easy to integrate with modern LLM inference frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Most conventional statistical methods address this distribution shift through inverse probability weighting (IPW), which requires estimating propensity scores as an intermediate step. These methods face two key challenges: inaccurate propensity estimation and instability from extreme weights. We decompose the generalization error to isolate these issues--propensity ambiguity and statistical instability--and address them through an adversarial loss function. Our approach combines distributionally robust optimization for handling propensity uncertainty with weight regularization based on weighted Rademacher complexity. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The V...</summary><p>The Version of Record of this contribution is published in the Neural Information Processing, ICONIP 2025 Proceedings and is available online at https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-95-4094-5_19</p></details> |

Recent years have seen a commensurate surge in first-order methods aiming to improve the complexity of large-scale (E)OT. However, there has been a consistent tradeoff: attaining state-of-the-art rates requires $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ storage to enable ergodic primal averaging. In this work, we demonstrate that recently proposed primal-dual extragradient methods (PDXG) can be implemented entirely in the dual with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ storage. Additionally, we prove that regularizing the reformulated OT problem is equivalent to EOT with extensions to entropy-regularized barycenter problems, further widening the applications of the proposed method. The proposed dual-only extragradient method (DXG) achieves $\mathcal{O}(n^2\varepsilon^{-1})$ complexity for $\varepsilon$-approximate OT with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ memory. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the dual extragradient method scales favorably in non/weakly-regularized regimes compared to existing algorithms, though future work is needed to improve performance in certain problem classes.</p></details> | 46 pages, 6 figures |

Previous methods either adopt a fixed speculative decoding configuration regardless of the prefix tokens, or train draft models in an offline or online manner to align them with the context. This paper proposes a training-free online learning framework to adaptively choose the configuration of the hyperparameters for speculative decoding as text is being generated. We first formulate this hyperparameter selection problem as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem and provide a general speculative decoding framework BanditSpec. Furthermore, two bandit-based hyperparameter selection algorithms, UCBSpec and EXP3Spec, are designed and analyzed in terms of a novel quantity, the stopping time regret. We upper bound this regret under both stochastic and adversarial reward settings. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, it is shown that the regret performance of UCBSpec is optimal up to universal constants. Finally, extensive empirical experiments with LLaMA3 and Qwen2 demonstrate that our algorithms are effective compared to existing methods, and the throughput is close to the oracle best hyperparameter in simulated real-life LLM serving scenarios with diverse input prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ICML, typos and affiliations are corrected</p></details> |

By integrating conductive textile patches and a compact acquisition unit into a pair of pants, the system reconstructs lower-body pose without compromising comfort. Unlike IMU-based systems that require user-specific fitting or camera-based methods that compromise privacy, our approach operates without fitting adjustments and preserves user privacy. VersaPants is a custom-designed smart garment featuring 6 capacitive channels per leg. We employ a lightweight Transformer-based deep learning model that maps capacitance signals to joint angles, enabling embedded implementation on edge platforms. To test our system, we collected approximately 3.7 hours of motion data from 11 participants performing 16 daily and exercise-based movements. The model achieves a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 11.96 cm and a mean per-joint angle error (MPJAE) of 12.3 degrees across the hip, knee, and ankle joints, indicating the model's ability to generalize to unseen users and movements. A comparative analysis of existing textile-based deep learning architectures reveals that our model achieves competitive reconstruction performance with up to 22 times fewer parameters and 18 times fewer FLOPs, enabling real-time inference at 42 FPS on a commercial smartwatch without quantization. These results position VersaPants as a promising step toward scalable, comfortable, and embedded motion-capture solutions for fitness, healthcare, and wellbeing applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, their potential in 3D scene segmentation remains largely untapped, despite the common availability of 2D images alongside 3D point cloud datasets. While significant research has been dedicated to 2D-3D fusion, recent state-of-the-art 3D methods predominantly focus on 3D data, leaving the integration of VFMs into 3D models underexplored. In this work, we challenge this trend by introducing DITR, a generally applicable approach that extracts 2D foundation model features, projects them to 3D, and finally injects them into a 3D point cloud segmentation model. DITR achieves state-of-the-art results on both indoor and outdoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. To enable the use of VFMs even when images are unavailable during inference, we additionally propose to pretrain 3D models by distilling 2D foundation models. By initializing the 3D backbone with knowledge distilled from 2D VFMs, we create a strong basis for downstream 3D segmentation tasks, ultimately boosting performance across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 3DV 2026.

However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network. We compare our method with the InEKF and the KalmanNet approaches on datasets obtained from the humanoid robot RH5.

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are fundamental for evaluating a patient's cardiac health and are readily available. Despite this, little attention has been given to the remarkable potential of ECG data in detecting non-cardiac conditions. In our study, we used publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG-ICD and ECG-VIEW II) to investigate the feasibility of inferring general diagnostic conditions from ECG features. To this end, we trained a tree-based model (XGBoost) based on ECG features and basic demographic features to estimate a wide range of diagnoses, encompassing both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate the reliability of estimating 23 cardiac as well as 21 non-cardiac conditions above 0.7 AUROC in a statistically significant manner across a wide range of physiological categories.

The continuous estimation of laboratory values from non-invasive data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) would therefore mark a significant frontier in healthcare monitoring.

In this preliminary study, we used a publicly available dataset (MIMIC-IV-ECG) to investigate the feasibility of inferring laboratory values from ECG features and patient demographics using tree-based models (XGBoost). We define the prediction task as a binary problem of whether the lab value falls into low or high abnormalities. We assessed model performance with AUROC. Our findings demonstrate promising results in the estimation of laboratory values related to different organ systems. While further research and validation are warranted to fully assess the clinical utility and generalizability of the approach, our findings lay the groundwork for future investigations for laboratory value estimation using ECG data.

These vulnerabilities arise from two core weaknesses: the continuous nature of visual representations, which allows for gradient-based attacks, and the inadequate transfer of text-based safety mechanisms to visual content. We introduce Q-MLLM, a novel architecture that integrates two-level vector quantization to create a discrete bottleneck against adversarial attacks while preserving multimodal reasoning capabilities. By discretizing visual representations at both pixel-patch and semantic levels, Q-MLLM blocks attack pathways and bridges the cross-modal safety alignment gap. Our two-stage training methodology ensures robust learning while maintaining model utility. Experiments demonstrate that Q-MLLM achieves significantly better defense success rate against both jailbreak attacks and toxic image attacks than existing approaches. Notably, Q-MLLM achieves perfect defense success rate (100\%) against jailbreak attacks except in one arguable case, while maintaining competitive performance on multiple utility benchmarks with minimal inference overhead. This work establishes vector quantization as an effective defense mechanism for secure multimodal AI systems without requiring expensive safety-specific fine-tuning or detection overhead.

| **[Real-Time Inference for Distributed Multimodal Systems under Communication Delay Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16225v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connected cyber-physical systems perform inference based on real-time inputs from multiple data streams. Uncertain communication delays across data streams challenge the temporal flow of the inference process. State-of-the-art (SotA) non-blocking inference methods rely on a reference-modality paradigm, requiring one modality input to be fully received before processing, while depending on costly offline profiling. We propose a novel, neuro-inspired non-blocking inference paradigm that primarily employs adaptive temporal windows of integration (TWIs) to dynamically adjust to stochastic delay patterns across heterogeneous streams while relaxing the reference-modality requirement. Our communication-delay-aware framework achieves robust real-time inference with finer-grained control over the accuracy-latency tradeoff. Experiments on the audio-visual event localization (AVEL) task demonstrate superior adaptability to network dynamics compared to SotA approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE ICC 2026</p></details> |
| **[CRISP: Persistent Concept Unlearning via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13650v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features. However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Target Refocusing via Attention Redistribution for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation: An Explainability Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16170v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Multi-Step Legal Reasoning and Analyzing Chain-of-Thought Effects in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07979v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yuwenhan07/MSLR-Bench and https://law.sjtu.edu.cn/flszyjzx/index.html.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Finding happiness by evolutionary algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20934v4)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A recent line of research concerns the problem of soft happy colouring (SHC), which requires that a partially coloured graph be extended to a complete colouring to maximise local agreements, so that as many vertices as possible end up surrounded by enough same-coloured neighbours. It is already known that SHC is NP-hard, and its solutions have a direct relationship with the community structure of networks; thus, it has immense applications in security and resilience. Past studies have shown that local search approaches can be fast and effective to an extent on the SHC; however, they often get stuck in local optima. Regarding the related problem of maximising happy vertices, evolutionary approaches have been proven effective; hence, this study develops a customised memetic algorithm that is a hybrid of genetic algorithms and local search. The experimental evaluation on a range of graphs in the stochastic block model shows that the memetic algorithm can achieve excellent results in search for an optimised solution to SHC compared to the local search approaches and standard genetic algorithms. Moreover, learning and evolution in the memetic algorithm allow diversification of solutions generated by fast, effective local search approaches, which prove superior for the challenging problem of community detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 15 Figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time 3D Object Detection with Inference-Aligned Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16140v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

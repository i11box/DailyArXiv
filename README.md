| **[Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13837v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed corresponding base models' capacity. In this study, however, we critically re-examines this assumption by measuring the pass@\textit{k} metric with large values of \textit{k} to explore the reasoning capability boundary of the models across a wide range of model families and benchmarks. Surprisingly, the RL does \emph{not}, in fact, elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RL-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\eg, $k$=1), base models can achieve a comparable or even higher pass@$k$ score compared to their RL counterparts at large $k$ values. The reasoning paths generated by RL-trained models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models. Further analysis shows that RL training boosts the performance by biasing the model's output distribution toward paths that are more likely to yield rewards, therefore sampling correct responses more efficiently. But this also results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models. Similar results are observed in visual reasoning tasks trained with RLVR. Moreover, we find that distillation can genuinely introduce new knowledge into the model, different from RLVR. These findings underscore a critical limitation of RLVR in advancing LLM reasoning abilities which requires us to fundamentally rethink the impact of RL training in reasoning LLMs and the need of a better paradigm.

| **[Outlier-Robust Multi-Model Fitting on Quantum Annealers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13836v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-model fitting (MMF) presents a significant challenge in Computer Vision, particularly due to its combinatorial nature. While recent advancements in quantum computing offer promise for addressing NP-hard problems, existing quantum-based approaches for model fitting are either limited to a single model or consider multi-model scenarios within outlier-free datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach, the robust quantum multi-model fitting (R-QuMF) algorithm, designed to handle outliers effectively. Our method leverages the intrinsic capabilities of quantum hardware to tackle combinatorial challenges inherent in MMF tasks, and it does not require prior knowledge of the exact number of models, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. By formulating the problem as a maximum set coverage task for adiabatic quantum computers (AQC), R-QuMF outperforms existing quantum techniques, demonstrating superior performance across various synthetic and real-world 3D datasets. Our findings underscore the potential of quantum computing in addressing the complexities of MMF, especially in real-world scenarios with noisy and outlier-prone data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 Workshop "Image Matching: Local Features & Beyond"</p></details> |
| **[CheXWorld: Exploring Image World Modeling for Radiograph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13820v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can develop internal world models that encode common sense knowledge, telling them how the world works and predicting the consequences of their actions. This concept has emerged as a promising direction for establishing general-purpose machine-learning models in recent preliminary works, e.g., for visual representation learning. In this paper, we present CheXWorld, the first effort towards a self-supervised world model for radiographic images. Specifically, our work develops a unified framework that simultaneously models three aspects of medical knowledge essential for qualified radiologists, including 1) local anatomical structures describing the fine-grained characteristics of local tissues (e.g., architectures, shapes, and textures); 2) global anatomical layouts describing the global organization of the human body (e.g., layouts of organs and skeletons); and 3) domain variations that encourage CheXWorld to model the transitions across different appearance domains of radiographs (e.g., varying clarity, contrast, and exposure caused by collecting radiographs from different hospitals, devices, or patients). Empirically, we design tailored qualitative and quantitative analyses, revealing that CheXWorld successfully captures these three dimensions of medical knowledge. Furthermore, transfer learning experiments across eight medical image classification and segmentation benchmarks showcase that CheXWorld significantly outperforms existing SSL methods and large-scale medical foundation models.

| **[Not All Rollouts are Useful: Down-Sampling Rollouts in LLM Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13818v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models, but faces a fundamental asymmetry in computation and memory requirements: inference is embarrassingly parallel with a minimal memory footprint, while policy updates require extensive synchronization and are memory-intensive. To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Transferrable Surrogates in Expressive Neural Architecture Search Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12971v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://shiwenqin.github.io/TransferrableSurrogate/</p></details> |
| **[High-Resolution Frame Interpolation with Patch-based Cascaded Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11838v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for high resolution frame interpolation, HIFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low to high resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. At inference time, this drastically reduces memory usage and allows a single model, solving both frame interpolation (base model's task) and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost as well. HIFI excels at high-resolution images and complex repeated textures that require global context, achieving comparable or state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, and SEPE-8K). We further introduce a new dataset, LaMoR, that focuses on particularly challenging cases, and HIFI significantly outperforms other baselines.

| **[A Fast Direct Solver for Boundary Integral Equations Using Quadrature By Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13809v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct and analyze a hierarchical direct solver for linear systems arising from the discretization of boundary integral equations using the Quadrature by Expansion (QBX) method. Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID\@. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |
| **[LearnAct: Few-Shot Mobile GUI Agent with a Unified Demonstration Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13805v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile GUI agents show promise in automating tasks but face generalization challenges in diverse real-world scenarios. Traditional approaches using pre-training or fine-tuning with massive datasets struggle with the diversity of mobile applications and user-specific tasks. We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents, comprising 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality human demonstrations. We further develop LearnAct, a sophisticated multi-agent framework that automatically extracts knowledge from demonstrations to enhance task completion. This framework integrates three specialized agents: DemoParser for knowledge extraction, KnowSeeker for relevant knowledge retrieval, and ActExecutor for demonstration-enhanced task execution. Our experimental results show significant performance gains in both offline and online evaluations. In offline assessments, a single demonstration improves model performance, increasing Gemini-1.5-Pro's accuracy from 19.3% to 51.7%. In online evaluations, our framework enhances UI-TARS-7B-SFT's task success rate from 18.1% to 32.8%. LearnAct framework and LearnGUI benchmark establish demonstration-based learning as a promising direction for more adaptable, personalized, and deployable mobile GUI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 16 figures, the project resources are available at https://lgy0404.github.io/LearnAct</p></details> |
| **[Transformer Encoder and Multi-features Time2Vec for Financial Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13801v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements. In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, currently under review at Eusipco 2025</p></details> |
| **[ODHSR: Online Dense 3D Reconstruction of Humans and Scenes from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13167v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating a photorealistic scene and human reconstruction from a single monocular in-the-wild video figures prominently in the perception of a human-centric 3D world. Recent neural rendering advances have enabled holistic human-scene reconstruction but require pre-calibrated camera and human poses, and days of training time. In this work, we introduce a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs camera tracking, human pose estimation and human-scene reconstruction in an online fashion. 3D Gaussian Splatting is utilized to learn Gaussian primitives for humans and scenes efficiently, and reconstruction-based camera tracking and human pose estimation modules are designed to enable holistic understanding and effective disentanglement of pose and appearance. Specifically, we design a human deformation module to reconstruct the details and enhance generalizability to out-of-distribution poses faithfully. Aiming to learn the spatial correlation between human and scene accurately, we introduce occlusion-aware human silhouette rendering and monocular geometric priors, which further improve reconstruction quality. Experiments on the EMDB and NeuMan datasets demonstrate superior or on-par performance with existing methods in camera tracking, human pose estimation, novel view synthesis and runtime.

| **[Active Learning of Symbolic NetKAT Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13794v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NetKAT is a domain-specific programming language and logic that has been successfully used to specify and verify the behavior of packet-switched networks. This paper develops techniques for automatically learning NetKAT models of unknown networks using active learning. Prior work has explored active learning for a wide range of automata (e.g., deterministic, register, B\"uchi, timed etc.) and also developed applications, such as validating implementations of network protocols. We present algorithms for learning different types of NetKAT automata, including symbolic automata proposed in recent work. We prove the soundness of these algorithms, build a prototype implementation, and evaluate it on a standard benchmark. Our results highlight the applicability of symbolic NetKAT learning for realistic network configurations and topologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appearing in PLDI 2025</p></details> |
| **[SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19653v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ``system captions'' or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts. We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system. Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025. 23 pages.

| **[C-MTCSD: A Chinese Multi-Turn Conversational Stance Detection Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09958v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stance detection has become an essential tool for analyzing public discussions on social media. Current methods face significant challenges, particularly in Chinese language processing and multi-turn conversational analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce C-MTCSD, the largest Chinese multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset, comprising 24,264 carefully annotated instances from Sina Weibo, which is 4.2 times larger than the only prior Chinese conversational stance detection dataset. Our comprehensive evaluation using both traditional approaches and large language models reveals the complexity of C-MTCSD: even state-of-the-art models achieve only 64.07% F1 score in the challenging zero-shot setting, while performance consistently degrades with increasing conversation depth. Traditional models particularly struggle with implicit stance detection, achieving below 50% F1 score. This work establishes a challenging new benchmark for Chinese stance detection research, highlighting significant opportunities for future improvements.</p></details> | WWW2025 |
| **[Collective Learning Mechanism based Optimal Transport Generative Adversarial Network for Non-parallel Voice Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13791v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After demonstrating significant success in image synthesis, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models have likewise made significant progress in the field of speech synthesis, leveraging their capacity to adapt the precise distribution of target data through adversarial learning processes. Notably, in the realm of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) GAN-based Voice Conversion (VC) models, there exists a substantial disparity in naturalness between real and GAN-generated speech samples. Furthermore, while many GAN models currently operate on a single generator discriminator learning approach, optimizing target data distribution is more effectively achievable through a single generator multi-discriminator learning scheme. Hence, this study introduces a novel GAN model named Collective Learning Mechanism-based Optimal Transport GAN (CLOT-GAN) model, incorporating multiple discriminators, including the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model, Vision Transformer (ViT), and conformer. The objective of integrating various discriminators lies in their ability to comprehend the formant distribution of mel-spectrograms, facilitated by a collective learning mechanism. Simultaneously, the inclusion of Optimal Transport (OT) loss aims to precisely bridge the gap between the source and target data distribution, employing the principles of OT theory. The experimental validation on VCC 2018, VCTK, and CMU-Arctic datasets confirms that the CLOT-GAN-VC model outperforms existing VC models in objective and subjective assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[VCR: A Task for Pixel-Level Complex Reasoning in Vision Language Models via Restoring Occluded Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06462v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Visual Caption Restoration (VCR), a novel vision-language task that challenges models to accurately restore partially obscured texts using pixel-level hints within images. This task stems from the observation that text embedded in images is intrinsically different from common visual elements and natural language due to the need to align the modalities of vision, text, and text embedded in images. While numerous works have integrated text embedded in images into visual question-answering tasks, approaches to these tasks generally rely on optical character recognition or masked language modeling, thus reducing the task to mainly text-based processing. However, text-based processing becomes ineffective in VCR as accurate text restoration depends on the combined information from provided images, context, and subtle cues from the tiny exposed areas of masked texts. We develop a pipeline to generate synthetic images for the VCR task using image-caption pairs, with adjustable caption visibility to control the task difficulty. With this pipeline, we construct a dataset for VCR called VCR-Wiki using images with captions from Wikipedia, comprising 2.11M English and 346K Chinese entities in both easy and hard split variants. Our results reveal that current vision language models significantly lag behind human performance in the VCR task, and merely fine-tuning the models on our dataset does not lead to notable improvements. We release VCR-Wiki and the data construction code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck , thanks to their capability of representing this amount of information efficiently. Most efforts so far have been centered around determining the ground states of chemical systems. However, hardness results and the lack of theoretical guarantees for efficient heuristics for initial-state generation shed doubt on the feasibility. Here, we propose a heuristically guided approach that is based on inherently efficient routines to solve chemical simulation problems, requiring quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states for dynamics simulation by assembling them in a scattering tree. In particular, we investigate a scattering-based state preparation approach within the context of mergo-association. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured after the quantum simulation of a process, e.g., a reaction, following its corresponding initial state preparation.</p></details> | <details><summary>signi...</summary><p>significant update, added section IV; 32 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[BadApex: Backdoor Attack Based on Adaptive Optimization Mechanism of Black-box Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13775v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous insertion-based and paraphrase-based backdoors have achieved great success in attack efficacy, but they ignore the text quality and semantic consistency between poisoned and clean texts. Although recent studies introduce LLMs to generate poisoned texts and improve the stealthiness, semantic consistency, and text quality, their hand-crafted prompts rely on expert experiences, facing significant challenges in prompt adaptability and attack performance after defenses. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack based on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models (BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a refined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to refine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification agents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial prompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text and refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the refined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two defenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic consistency, and text quality. Furthermore, when two defense methods are applied, the average attack success rate (ASR) still up to 96.75%.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DP2Unlearning: An Efficient and Guaranteed Unlearning Framework for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13774v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.</p></details> | 49 pages |
| **[Bake Two Cakes with One Oven: RL for Defusing Popularity Bias and Cold-start in Third-Party Library Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13772v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Third-party libraries (TPLs) have become an integral part of modern software development, enhancing developer productivity and accelerating time-to-market. However, identifying suitable candidates from a rapidly growing and continuously evolving collection of TPLs remains a challenging task. TPL recommender systems have been studied, offering a promising solution to address this issue. They typically rely on collaborative filtering (CF) that exploits a two-dimensional project-library matrix (user-item in general context of recommendation) when making recommendations. We have noticed that CF-based approaches often encounter two challenges: (i) a tendency to recommend popular items more frequently, making them even more dominant, a phenomenon known as popularity bias, and (ii) difficulty in generating recommendations for new users or items due to limited user-item interactions, commonly referred to as the cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach to address popularity bias and the cold-start problem in TPL recommendation. Our method comprises three key components. First, we utilize a graph convolution network (GCN)-based embedding model to learn user preferences and user-item interactions, allowing us to capture complex relationships within interaction subgraphs and effectively represent new user/item embeddings. Second, we introduce an aggregation operator to generate a representative embedding from user and item embeddings, which is then used to model cold-start users. Finally, we adopt a model-based RL framework for TPL recommendation, where popularity bias is mitigated through a carefully designed reward function and a rarity-based replay buffer partitioning strategy. The results demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in cold-start scenarios while effectively mitigating the impact of popularity bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |

Understanding and designing RNA can enable novel therapeutic application and biotechnological innovation. To enhance RNA design, in this paper we introduce RiboGen, the first deep learning model to simultaneously generate RNA sequence and all-atom 3D structure. RiboGen leverages the standard Flow Matching with Discrete Flow Matching in a multimodal data representation. RiboGen is based on Euclidean Equivariant neural networks for efficiently processing and learning three-dimensional geometry. Our experiments show that RiboGen can efficiently generate chemically plausible and self-consistent RNA samples, suggesting that co-generation of sequence and structure is a competitive approach for modeling RNA.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Babysit A Language Model From Scratch: Interactive Language Learning by Trials and Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13828v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans are efficient language learners and inherently social creatures. Our language development is largely shaped by our social interactions, for example, the demonstration and feedback from caregivers. Contrary to human language learning, recent advancements in large language models have primarily adopted a non-interactive training paradigm, and refined pre-trained models through feedback afterward. In this work, we explore how corrective feedback from interactions influences neural language acquisition from scratch through systematically controlled experiments, assessing whether it contributes to word learning efficiency in language models. We introduce a trial-and-demonstration (TnD) learning framework that incorporates three distinct components: student trials, teacher demonstrations, and a reward conditioned on language competence at various developmental stages. Our experiments reveal that the TnD approach accelerates word acquisition for student models of equal and smaller numbers of parameters, and we highlight the significance of both trials and demonstrations. We further show that the teacher's choices of words influence students' word-specific learning efficiency, and a practice-makes-perfect effect is evident by a strong correlation between the frequency of words in trials and their respective learning curves. Our findings suggest that interactive language learning, with teacher demonstrations and active trials, can facilitate efficient word learning in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 (Main) & Workshop on Large Language Models and Cognition @ ICML 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Modeling L1 Influence on L2 Pronunciation: An MFCC-Based Framework for Explainable Machine Learning and Pedagogical Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13765v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the extent to which Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) capture first language (L1) transfer in extended second language (L2) English speech. Speech samples from Mandarin and American English L1 speakers were extracted from the GMU Speech Accent Archive, converted to WAV format, and processed to obtain thirteen MFCCs per speaker. A multi-method analytic framework combining inferential statistics (t-tests, MANOVA, Canonical Discriminant Analysis) and machine learning (Random Forest classification) identified MFCC-1 (broadband energy), MFCC-2 (first formant region), and MFCC-5 (voicing and fricative energy) as the most discriminative features for distinguishing L1 backgrounds. A reduced-feature model using these MFCCs significantly outperformed the full-feature model, as confirmed by McNemar's test and non-overlapping confidence intervals. The findings empirically support the Perceptual Assimilation Model for L2 (PAM-L2) and the Speech Learning Model (SLM), demonstrating that L1-conditioned variation in L2 speech is both perceptually grounded and acoustically quantifiable. Methodologically, the study contributes to applied linguistics and explainable AI by proposing a transparent, data-efficient pipeline for L2 pronunciation modeling.

| **[A theory of generalised coordinates for stochastic differential equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15532v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations are ubiquitous modelling tools in physics and the sciences. In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving dynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which renders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored'' noise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for mathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this report, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically studying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the theory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of the noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of Markovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an extended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however, the Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be exact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory is exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when flows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools, which we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be useful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of smoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward methods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we re-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for time-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised coordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages of main; 47 pages including abstract, TOC, Appendix and references</p></details> |
| **[Decoding Vision Transformers: the Diffusion Steering Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13763v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al. (2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 17 figures.

An on-grid approximation is first considered, enabling rigorous hierarchical-sparsity modeling and compressed sensing-based channel estimation. Guaranteed recovery conditions are provided for affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier modulation (SCM), highlighting the superiority of AFDM in terms of doubly sparse channel estimation. To address arbitrary Doppler shifts, a relaxed version of the on-grid model is introduced by making use of multiple elementary Expansion Models (BEM) each based on Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS). Next, theoretical guarantees are provided for the precision of this off-grid model before further extending it to tackle channel prediction by exploiting the inherent DPSS extrapolation capability. Finally, numerical results are provided to both validate the proposed off-grid model for channel estimation and prediction purposes under the double sparsity assumption and to compare the corresponding mean squared error (MSE) and the overhead performance when the different wireless waveforms are used.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We propose a new idea for the community to adopt: convert scholarly documents into knowledge preserving, but style agnostic representations we term Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95\%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

The coefficients of the equations are perturbed by high-dimensional random parameters, this fits in particular for modelling flows in domains with uncertain perturbations. Our focus is on deriving bounds for arbitrary high-order derivatives of the pressure and the velocity fields with respect to the random parameters in the context of incompressible Navier-Stokes equation under a small-data assumption. To achieve this, we analyze mixed and saddle-point problems and employ the alternative-to-factorial technique to establish generalized Gevrey-class regularity for the solution pair. Thereby the analytic regularity follows as a special case. In the numerical experiments, we validate and illustrate our theoretical findings using Gauss-Legendre quadrature and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</p></details> | 43 pages, 4 figues |

By initializing from multimodal Generative PreTraining (mGPT), we demonstrate that decoder-only Autoregressive (AR) model can achieve image generation performance comparable to modern diffusion models with high efficiency through Flexible Progressive Supervised Fine-tuning (FP-SFT). Equipped with our proposed Unambiguous image Representation (UniRep), Lumina-mGPT can flexibly generate high-quality images of varying aspect ratios. Building on the strong image generation capabilities, we further explore Ominiponent Supervised Fine-tuning (Omni-SFT), an initial attempt to elevate Lumina-mGPT into a unified multi-modal generalist. The resulting model demonstrates versatile multimodal capabilities, including visual generation tasks like text-to-image/multiview generation and controllable generation, visual recognition tasks like segmentation and depth estimation, and vision-language tasks like multi-turn visual question answering, showing the rosy potential of the technical direction.

In this paper, we introduce a cognitive model of epistemic language interpretation, grounded in Bayesian inferences about other agents' goals, beliefs, and intentions: a language-augmented Bayesian theory-of-mind (LaBToM). By translating natural language into an epistemic ``language-of-thought'' with grammar-constrained LLM decoding, then evaluating these translations against the inferences produced by inverting a generative model of rational action and perception, LaBToM captures graded plausibility judgments of epistemic claims. We validate our model in an experiment where participants watch an agent navigate a maze to find keys hidden in boxes needed to reach their goal, then rate sentences about the agent's beliefs. In contrast with multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) and ablated models, our model correlates highly with human judgments for a wide range of expressions, including modal language, uncertainty expressions, knowledge claims, likelihood comparisons, and attributions of false belief.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages; Published at the Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL); Presented at NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Bayesian nonparametric approach to mediation and spillover effects with multiple mediators in cluster-randomized trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03489v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) with multiple unstructured mediators present significant methodological challenges for causal inference due to within-cluster correlation, interference among units, and the complexity introduced by multiple mediators. Existing causal mediation methods often fall short in simultaneously addressing these complexities, particularly in disentangling mediator-specific effects under interference that are central to studying complex mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose new causal estimands for spillover mediation effects that differentiate the roles of each individual's own mediator and the spillover effects resulting from interactions among individuals within the same cluster. We establish identification results for each estimand and, to flexibly model the complex data structures inherent in CRTs, we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric prior -- the Nested Dependent Dirichlet Process Mixture -- designed for flexibly capture the outcome and mediator surfaces at different levels. We conduct extensive simulations across various scenarios to evaluate the frequentist performance of our methods, compare them with a Bayesian parametric counterpart and illustrate our new methods in an analysis of a completed CRT.</p></details> | 94 pages |

While deep learning approaches have significantly advanced CD performance, current methods suffer from poor domain adaptability, requiring extensive labeled data for retraining when applied to new scenarios. This limitation severely restricts their practical applications across different datasets. In this work, we propose DAM-Net: a Domain Adaptation Network with Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning for CD. Our network introduces adversarial domain adaptation to CD for, utilizing a specially designed segmentation-discriminator and alternating training strategy to enable effective transfer between domains. Additionally, we propose a novel Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning approach that strategically selects and labels a minimal amount of samples (less than 1%) to enhance domain adaptation. The network incorporates a Multi-Temporal Transformer for feature fusion and optimized backbone structure based on previous research. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate that DAM-Net significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving comparable performance to semi-supervised approaches that require 10% labeled data while using only 0.3% labeled samples. Our approach significantly advances cross-dataset CD applications and provides a new paradigm for efficient domain adaptation in remote sensing. The source code of DAM-Net will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

A Generalization Analysis of Nonlinear Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10957v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 as an oral paper</p></details> |

The integration of sensing and communication technology provides a promising solution by enabling the legitimate transmitter to sense and track the warden, thereby enhancing transmission covertness. In this paper, we develop a framework for sensing-then-beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) systems, where the transmitter (Alice) estimates and tracks the mobile aerial warden's channel using sensing echo signals while simultaneously sending covert information to multiple legitimate users (Bobs) with the assistance of RIS, under the surveillance of the warden (Willie). Considering channel estimation errors, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that jointly designs the communication beamformers, the sensing signal covariance matrix at Alice, and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the covert sum rate of Bobs while satisfying the constraints related to covert communication, sensing, transmitter power, and the unit modulus of the RIS elements. To solve this complex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm using alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, sequential rank-one constraint relaxation, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical results confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in tracking the warden's channel while ensuring robust covert transmission. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of using RIS to enhance the covert transmission rate compared to baseline schemes, and also illustrate the intricate trade-off between communication and sensing in ISCC systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

We develop a machine-learning-based kinematics model and demonstrate a functional workspace of roughly 10cm in each translation direction and 28 degrees in each orientation.

Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the postulated logarithmic observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the invertibility of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our invertibility result is agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient (though not necessary) to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous. We validate our theoretical findings and highlight the superior stability and performance of ISD over ESD filters through extensive simulation studies. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through an empirical application to U.S. Treasury-bill rates.</p></details> | 72 pages |

Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices' processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches, which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream, and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or packet losses. In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run inference even with partial data availability. Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA, achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01 pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's accepted manuscript.

Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however, exhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they struggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static regularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function of gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the regularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true treatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method successfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy in treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic regularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version. 13 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present CONTACT, a framework for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision improves generalization in low-resource settings.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective methods to detect AI-generated images (AIGI). Despite progress in AIGI detection, achieving reliable performance across diverse generation models and scenes remains challenging due to the lack of source-invariant features and limited generalization capabilities in existing methods. In this work, we explore the potential of using image entropy as a cue for AIGI detection and propose Multi-granularity Local Entropy Patterns (MLEP), a set of entropy feature maps computed across shuffled small patches over multiple image scaled. MLEP comprehensively captures pixel relationships across dimensions and scales while significantly disrupting image semantics, reducing potential content bias. Leveraging MLEP, a robust CNN-based classifier for AIGI detection can be trained. Extensive experiments conducted in an open-world scenario, evaluating images synthesized by 32 distinct generative models, demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

We approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and biological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving into operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization techniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for breast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI and causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past and future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the causality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature co-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable predictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that integrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and prior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological vision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a connectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall, our key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for medical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and radiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak causal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve performance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical domains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit motifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward human-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and clinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy, and safe deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Perso...</summary><p>Personal adaptation and expansion of doctoral thesis (originally submitted in Oct 2024, revisioned in Jan 2025)</p></details> |

Meanwhile, LLM agents -- which use external tools and can execute multi-stage tasks -- may pose a greater risk if misused, but their robustness remains underexplored. To facilitate research on LLM agent misuse, we propose a new benchmark called AgentHarm. The benchmark includes a diverse set of 110 explicitly malicious agent tasks (440 with augmentations), covering 11 harm categories including fraud, cybercrime, and harassment. In addition to measuring whether models refuse harmful agentic requests, scoring well on AgentHarm requires jailbroken agents to maintain their capabilities following an attack to complete a multi-step task. We evaluate a range of leading LLMs, and find (1) leading LLMs are surprisingly compliant with malicious agent requests without jailbreaking, (2) simple universal jailbreak templates can be adapted to effectively jailbreak agents, and (3) these jailbreaks enable coherent and malicious multi-step agent behavior and retain model capabilities. To enable simple and reliable evaluation of attacks and defenses for LLM-based agents, we publicly release AgentHarm at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ai-safety-institute/AgentHarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID\@. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements. In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, currently under review at Eusipco 2025</p></details> |
| **[Collective Learning Mechanism based Optimal Transport Generative Adversarial Network for Non-parallel Voice Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13791v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After demonstrating significant success in image synthesis, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models have likewise made significant progress in the field of speech synthesis, leveraging their capacity to adapt the precise distribution of target data through adversarial learning processes. Notably, in the realm of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) GAN-based Voice Conversion (VC) models, there exists a substantial disparity in naturalness between real and GAN-generated speech samples. Furthermore, while many GAN models currently operate on a single generator discriminator learning approach, optimizing target data distribution is more effectively achievable through a single generator multi-discriminator learning scheme. Hence, this study introduces a novel GAN model named Collective Learning Mechanism-based Optimal Transport GAN (CLOT-GAN) model, incorporating multiple discriminators, including the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model, Vision Transformer (ViT), and conformer. The objective of integrating various discriminators lies in their ability to comprehend the formant distribution of mel-spectrograms, facilitated by a collective learning mechanism. Simultaneously, the inclusion of Optimal Transport (OT) loss aims to precisely bridge the gap between the source and target data distribution, employing the principles of OT theory. The experimental validation on VCC 2018, VCTK, and CMU-Arctic datasets confirms that the CLOT-GAN-VC model outperforms existing VC models in objective and subjective assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate how internal noise during the training of neural networks affects the final performance of recurrent and deep neural networks. We consider feedforward networks (FNN) and echo state networks (ESN) as examples. The types of noise examined originated from a real optical implementation of a neural network. However, these types were subsequently generalized to enhance the applicability of our findings on a broader scale. The noise types considered include additive and multiplicative noise, which depend on how noise influences each individual neuron, and correlated and uncorrelated noise, which pertains to the impact of noise on groups of neurons (such as the hidden layer of FNNs or the reservoir of ESNs). In this paper, we demonstrate that, in most cases, both deep and echo state networks benefit from internal noise during training, as it enhances their resilience to noise. Consequently, the testing performance at the same noise intensities is significantly higher for networks trained with noise than for those trained without it. Notably, only multiplicative correlated noise during training has minimal has almost no impact on both deep and recurrent networks.</p></details> | 8 pages 5 figures |
| **[Decoding Vision Transformers: the Diffusion Steering Lens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13763v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logit Lens is a widely adopted method for mechanistic interpretability of transformer-based language models, enabling the analysis of how internal representations evolve across layers by projecting them into the output vocabulary space. Although applying Logit Lens to Vision Transformers (ViTs) is technically straightforward, its direct use faces limitations in capturing the richness of visual representations. Building on the work of Toker et al. (2024)~\cite{Toker2024-ve}, who introduced Diffusion Lens to visualize intermediate representations in the text encoders of text-to-image diffusion models, we demonstrate that while Diffusion Lens can effectively visualize residual stream representations in image encoders, it fails to capture the direct contributions of individual submodules. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{Diffusion Steering Lens} (DSL), a novel, training-free approach that steers submodule outputs and patches subsequent indirect contributions. We validate our method through interventional studies, showing that DSL provides an intuitive and reliable interpretation of the internal processing in ViTs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 17 figures.

An on-grid approximation is first considered, enabling rigorous hierarchical-sparsity modeling and compressed sensing-based channel estimation. Guaranteed recovery conditions are provided for affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and single-carrier modulation (SCM), highlighting the superiority of AFDM in terms of doubly sparse channel estimation. To address arbitrary Doppler shifts, a relaxed version of the on-grid model is introduced by making use of multiple elementary Expansion Models (BEM) each based on Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS). Next, theoretical guarantees are provided for the precision of this off-grid model before further extending it to tackle channel prediction by exploiting the inherent DPSS extrapolation capability. Finally, numerical results are provided to both validate the proposed off-grid model for channel estimation and prediction purposes under the double sparsity assumption and to compare the corresponding mean squared error (MSE) and the overhead performance when the different wireless waveforms are used.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |

We take the position that it is both legally and technically feasible to extract the scientific knowledge in scholarly texts. Current methods, like text embeddings, fail to reliably preserve factual content, and simple paraphrasing may not be legally sound. We propose a new idea for the community to adopt: convert scholarly documents into knowledge preserving, but style agnostic representations we term Knowledge Units using LLMs. These units use structured data capturing entities, attributes and relationships without stylistic content. We provide evidence that Knowledge Units (1) form a legally defensible framework for sharing knowledge from copyrighted research texts, based on legal analyses of German copyright law and U.S. Fair Use doctrine, and (2) preserve most (~95\%) factual knowledge from original text, measured by MCQ performance on facts from the original copyrighted text across four research domains. Freeing scientific knowledge from copyright promises transformative benefits for scientific research and education by allowing language models to reuse important facts from copyrighted text. To support this, we share open-source tools for converting research documents into Knowledge Units. Overall, our work posits the feasibility of democratizing access to scientific knowledge while respecting copyright.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13754v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to seamlessly bridge patch-level predictions to whole slide image-level classifications. We validate CMSwinKAN on the PpNTs dataset, which was collaboratively established with our partner hospital and the publicly accessible BreakHis dataset. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

While deep learning approaches have significantly advanced CD performance, current methods suffer from poor domain adaptability, requiring extensive labeled data for retraining when applied to new scenarios. This limitation severely restricts their practical applications across different datasets. In this work, we propose DAM-Net: a Domain Adaptation Network with Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning for CD. Our network introduces adversarial domain adaptation to CD for, utilizing a specially designed segmentation-discriminator and alternating training strategy to enable effective transfer between domains. Additionally, we propose a novel Micro-Labeled Fine-Tuning approach that strategically selects and labels a minimal amount of samples (less than 1%) to enhance domain adaptation. The network incorporates a Multi-Temporal Transformer for feature fusion and optimized backbone structure based on previous research. Experiments conducted on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets demonstrate that DAM-Net significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving comparable performance to semi-supervised approaches that require 10% labeled data while using only 0.3% labeled samples. Our approach significantly advances cross-dataset CD applications and provides a new paradigm for efficient domain adaptation in remote sensing. The source code of DAM-Net will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

A Generalization Analysis of Nonlinear Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10957v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[LimitNet: Progressive, Content-Aware Image Offloading for Extremely Weak Devices & Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13736v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IoT devices have limited hardware capabilities and are often deployed in remote areas. Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices' processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches, which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream, and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or packet losses. In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run inference even with partial data availability. Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA, achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01 pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's accepted manuscript.

A fundamental challenge in this task is deriving a consensus that adequately represents the diverse interests of individual group members. Despite advancements made by deep learning-based models, existing approaches still struggle in two main areas: (1) Capturing consensus in small-group settings, which are more prevalent in real-world applications, and (2) Balancing individual preferences with overall group performance, particularly in hypergraph-based methods that tend to emphasize group accuracy at the expense of personalization. To address these challenges, we introduce a Consensus-aware Contrastive Learning for Group Recommendation (CoCoRec) that models group consensus through contrastive learning. CoCoRec utilizes a transformer encoder to jointly learn user and group representations, enabling richer modeling of intra-group dynamics. Additionally, the contrastive objective helps reduce overfitting from high-frequency user interactions, leading to more robust and representative group embeddings. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that CoCoRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both individual and group recommendation scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of consensus-aware contrastive learning in group recommendation tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, their robustness to common image corruptions remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of VLM robustness across 19 corruption types from the ImageNet-C benchmark, spanning four categories: noise, blur, weather, and digital distortions. We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their differential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2304.10592, arXiv:2301.12597 by other authors</p></details> |

To address this gap, we establish formal characterizations of (strict) consistency for such transformed loss functions and their corresponding elicitable functionals. Our analysis focuses on two interrelated cases: (a) transformations applied solely to the realization variable and (b) bijective transformations applied jointly to both the realization and prediction variables. These cases extend the well-established framework of transformations applied exclusively to the prediction variable, as formalized by Osband's revelation principle. We further develop analogous characterizations for (strict) identification functions. The resulting theoretical framework is broadly applicable to statistical and machine learning methodologies. When applied to Bregman and expectile loss functions, our framework enables two key advancements: (a) the interpretation of empirical findings from models trained with transformed loss functions and (b) the systematic construction of novel identifiable and elicitable functionals, including the g-transformed expectation and g-transformed expectile. By unifying theoretical insights with practical applications, this work advances principled methodologies for designing loss functions in complex predictive tasks. Applications of the framework to simulated and real-world data illustrate its practical utility in diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While many methods have been developed, it is impossible to identify the current state-of-the-art, due to i) varying and small pretraining datasets, ii) varying architectures, and iii) being evaluated on differing downstream datasets. In this paper, we bring clarity to this field and lay the foundation for further method advancements through three key contributions: We a) publish the largest publicly available pre-training dataset comprising 114k 3D brain MRI volumes, enabling all practitioners to pre-train on a large-scale dataset. We b) benchmark existing 3D self-supervised learning methods on this dataset for a state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer architecture, clarifying the state of 3D SSL pre-training.

However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025. 26 pages, 19 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

The problem of stabilization for a two-layer composite beam has been previously studied by transforming the model into a 1-D hyperbolic PIDE-ODE form and then applying backstepping to this new system. In principle this approach is generalizable to any number of layers. However, when some of the layers have the same physical properties (as e.g. in lamination of repeated layers), the approach leads to isotachic hyperbolic PDEs (i.e. where some states have the same transport speed). This particular yet physical and interesting case has not received much attention beyond a few remarks in the early hyperbolic design. Thus, this work starts by extending the theory of backstepping control of (m + n) hyperbolic PIDEs and m ODEs to blocks of isotachic states, leading to a block backstepping design. Then, returning to multilayer Timoshenko beams, the Riemann transformation is used to transform the states of N-layer Timoshenko beams into a 1-D hyperbolic PIDE-ODE system. The block backstepping method is then applied to this model, obtaining closed-loop stability of the origin in the L2 sense. An arbitrarily rapid convergence rate can be obtained by adjusting control parameters. Finally, numerical simulations are presented corroborating the theoretical developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lates...</summary><p>Latest preprint version</p></details> |

In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques.

However, effectively adapting LLMs to the legal domain remains challenging due to the complexity of legal reasoning, the need for precise interpretation of specialized language, and the potential for hallucinations. This paper examines the efficacy of Domain-Adaptive Continual Pre-Training (DACP) in improving the legal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through a series of experiments on legal reasoning tasks within the Taiwanese legal framework, we demonstrate that while DACP enhances domain-specific knowledge, it does not uniformly improve performance across all legal tasks. We discuss the trade-offs involved in DACP, particularly its impact on model generalization and performance in prompt-based tasks, and propose directions for future research to optimize domain adaptation strategies in legal AI.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

As we know, CNN captures the local features well and the cascaded self-attention mechanisms are good at extracting the long-range global relations. It is intuitive to combine them for high-performance RGB-Event based video recognition, however, existing works fail to achieve a good balance between the accuracy and model parameters, as shown in Fig.~\ref{firstimage}. In this work, we propose a novel RGB-Event based recognition framework termed TSCFormer, which is a relatively lightweight CNN-Transformer model. Specifically, we mainly adopt the CNN as the backbone network to first encode both RGB and Event data. Meanwhile, we initialize global tokens as the input and fuse them with RGB and Event features using the BridgeFormer module. It captures the global long-range relations well between both modalities and maintains the simplicity of the whole model architecture at the same time. The enhanced features will be projected and fused into the RGB and Event CNN blocks, respectively, in an interactive manner using F2E and F2V modules. Similar operations are conducted for other CNN blocks to achieve adaptive fusion and local-global feature enhancement under different resolutions. Finally, we concatenate these three features and feed them into the classification head for pattern recognition. Extensive experiments on two large-scale RGB-Event benchmark datasets (PokerEvent and HARDVS) fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed TSCFormer. The source code and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/Event-AHU/TSCFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Machine Intelligence Research, DOI: 10.1007/s11633-025-1555-3</p></details> |

Regular screenings can effectively prevent benign polyps from progressing to CRC. While deep learning has made impressive strides in polyp segmentation, most existing models are trained on single-modality and single-center data, making them less effective in real-world clinical environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose FocusNet, a Transformer-enhanced focus attention network designed to improve polyp segmentation. FocusNet incorporates three essential modules: the Cross-semantic Interaction Decoder Module (CIDM) for generating coarse segmentation maps, the Detail Enhancement Module (DEM) for refining shallow features, and the Focus Attention Module (FAM), to balance local detail and global context through local and pooling attention mechanisms. We evaluate our model on PolypDB, a newly introduced dataset with multi-modality and multi-center data for building more reliable segmentation methods. Extensive experiments showed that FocusNet consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with a high dice coefficients of 82.47% on the BLI modality, 88.46% on FICE, 92.04% on LCI, 82.09% on the NBI and 93.42% on WLI modality, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness across five different modalities.

| **[Transformation trees -- documentation of multimodal image registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19140v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal image registration plays a key role in creating digital patient models by combining data from different imaging techniques into a single coordinate system. This process often involves multiple sequential and interconnected transformations, which must be well-documented to ensure transparency and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the use of transformation trees as a method for structured recording and management of these transformations. This approach has been implemented in the dpVision software and uses a dedicated .dpw file format to store hierarchical relationships between images, transformations, and motion data. Transformation trees allow precise tracking of all image processing steps, reduce the need to store multiple copies of the same data, and enable the indirect registration of images that do not share common reference points. This improves the reproducibility of the analyses and facilitates later processing and integration of images from different sources. The practical application of this method is demonstrated with examples from orthodontics, including the integration of 3D face scans, intraoral scans, and CBCT images, as well as the documentation of mandibular motion. Beyond orthodontics, this method can be applied in other fields that require systematic management of image registration processes, such as maxillofacial surgery, oncology, and biomechanical analysis. Maintaining long-term data consistency is essential for both scientific research and clinical practice. It enables easier comparison of results in longitudinal studies, improves retrospective analysis, and supports the development of artificial intelligence algorithms by providing standardized and well-documented datasets. The proposed approach enhances data organization, allows for efficient analysis, and facilitates the reuse of information in future studies and diagnostic procedures.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |

Properly distinguishing the processing of RGB and depth images is essential to fully exploiting their unique and significant characteristics. To address this, we propose a novel heterogeneous dual-branch framework called HDBFormer, specifically designed to handle these modality differences. For RGB images, which contain rich detail, we employ both a basic and detail encoder to extract local and global features. For the simpler depth images, we propose LDFormer, a lightweight hierarchical encoder that efficiently extracts depth features with fewer parameters. Additionally, we introduce the Modality Information Interaction Module (MIIM), which combines transformers with large kernel convolutions to interact global and local information across modalities efficiently. Extensive experiments show that HDBFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUDepthv2 and SUN-RGBD datasets.

Existing models struggle with low-resource languages like Sinhala and lack interpretability for practical use. This research develops a hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis framework that enhances multilingual capabilities with explainable outputs. Using cleaned banking customer reviews, we fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa for Sinhala and code-mixed text, integrate domain-specific lexicon correction, and employ BERT-base-uncased for English. The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with confidence scores, while SHAP and LIME improve interpretability by providing real-time sentiment explanations. Experimental results show that our approaches outperform traditional transformer-based classifiers, achieving 92.3 percent accuracy and an F1-score of 0.89 in English and 88.4 percent in Sinhala and code-mixed content. An explainability analysis reveals key sentiment drivers, improving trust and transparency. A user-friendly interface delivers aspect-wise sentiment insights, ensuring accessibility for businesses. This research contributes to robust, transparent sentiment analysis for financial applications by bridging gaps in multilingual, low-resource NLP and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spin glass model of in-context learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02288v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and further clarifies why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without further training. Our theory reveals that for single-instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed analytically tractable model thus offers a promising avenue for thinking about how to interpret many intriguing but puzzling properties of large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4+6 figures, revised version to the journal</p></details> |
| **[Masked Capsule Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04724v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Masked Capsule Autoencoders (MCAE), the first Capsule Network that utilises pretraining in a modern self-supervised paradigm, specifically the masked image modelling framework. Capsule Networks have emerged as a powerful alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They have shown favourable properties when compared to Vision Transformers (ViT), but have struggled to effectively learn when presented with more complex data. This has led to Capsule Network models that do not scale to modern tasks. Our proposed MCAE model alleviates this issue by reformulating the Capsule Network to use masked image modelling as a pretraining stage before finetuning in a supervised manner. Across several experiments and ablations studies we demonstrate that similarly to CNNs and ViTs, Capsule Networks can also benefit from self-supervised pretraining, paving the way for further advancements in this neural network domain. For instance, by pretraining on the Imagenette dataset-consisting of 10 classes of Imagenet-sized images-we achieve state-of-the-art results for Capsule Networks, demonstrating a 9% improvement compared to our baseline model. Thus, we propose that Capsule Networks benefit from and should be trained within a masked image modelling framework, using a novel capsule decoder, to enhance a Capsule Network's performance on realistically sized images.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables - accepted at TMLR</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion for Financial Market Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13522v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate financial market forecasting requires diverse data sources, including historical price trends, macroeconomic indicators, and financial news, each contributing unique predictive signals. However, existing methods often process these modalities independently or fail to effectively model their interactions. In this paper, we introduce Cross-Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF), a novel transformer-based framework that integrates heterogeneous financial data to improve predictive accuracy. Our approach employs attention mechanisms to dynamically weight the contribution of different modalities, along with a specialized tensor interpretation module for feature extraction. To facilitate rapid model iteration in industry applications, we incorporate a mature auto-training scheme that streamlines optimization. When applied to real-world financial datasets, CMTF demonstrates improvements over baseline models in forecasting stock price movements and provides a scalable and effective solution for cross-modal integration in financial market prediction.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Approximation-Generalization Trade-offs under (Approximate) Group Equivariance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17592v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The explicit incorporation of task-specific inductive biases through symmetry has emerged as a general design precept in the development of high-performance machine learning models. For example, group equivariant neural networks have demonstrated impressive performance across various domains and applications such as protein and drug design. A prevalent intuition about such models is that the integration of relevant symmetry results in enhanced generalization. Moreover, it is posited that when the data and/or the model may only exhibit $\textit{approximate}$ or $\textit{partial}$ symmetry, the optimal or best-performing model is one where the model symmetry aligns with the data symmetry. In this paper, we conduct a formal unified investigation of these intuitions. To begin, we present general quantitative bounds that demonstrate how models capturing task-specific symmetries lead to improved generalization. In fact, our results do not require the transformations to be finite or even form a group and can work with partial or approximate equivariance. Utilizing this quantification, we examine the more general question of model mis-specification i.e. when the model symmetries don't align with the data symmetries. We establish, for a given symmetry group, a quantitative comparison between the approximate/partial equivariance of the model and that of the data distribution, precisely connecting model equivariance error and data equivariance error. Our result delineates conditions under which the model equivariance error is optimal, thereby yielding the best-performing model for the given task and data. Our results are the most general results of their type in the literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages. Updated to the published version.

While these models have successfully enhanced appearance quality, they still face challenges in generating coherent and natural movements while efficiently sampling videos. In this paper, we propose to condense video generation into a problem of motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video generation more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video generation process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. Specifically, we present a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a motion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to implement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video autoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion representation. Consequently, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to efficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under multi-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion models. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos on various benchmark datasets, including BAIR, Landscape, NATOPS, MUG and CATER-GEN, that encompass a variety of stochastic dynamics and highly controllable movements on multiple image-conditional video generation tasks, while significantly decreases sampling time.</p></details> | accepted by IJCV |

Typically, only a few of the exposed items would be interacted with by the user. Although SR has achieved great success in predicting future user interests, existing SR methods still fail to fully exploit system exposure data. Most methods only model items that have been interacted with, while the large volume of exposed but non-interacted items is overlooked. Even methods that consider the whole system exposure typically train the recommender using only the logged historical system exposure, without exploring unseen user interests. In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation over system exposure for sequential recommendation (CaseRec). To better model historical system exposure, CaseRec introduces reinforcement learning to account for different exposure rewards. CaseRec uses a decision transformer-based sequential model to take an exposure sequence as input and assigns different rewards according to the user feedback. To further explore unseen user interests, CaseRec proposes to perform counterfactual augmentation, where exposed original items are replaced with counterfactual items. Then, a transformer-based user simulator is proposed to predict the user feedback reward for the augmented items. Augmentation, together with the user simulator, constructs counterfactual exposure sequences to uncover new user interests. Finally, CaseRec jointly uses the logged exposure sequences with the counterfactual exposure sequences to train a decision transformer-based sequential model for generating recommendation. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of CaseRec. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/CaseRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at SIGIR 2025 (Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval)</p></details> |

While methods such as the Fourier neural operator (FNO) have demonstrated notable performance, their reliance on uniform grids restricts their applicability to complex geometries and irregular meshes. Recently, Transformer-based neural operators with linear attention mechanisms have shown potential in overcoming these limitations for large-scale PDE simulations. However, these approaches predominantly emphasize global feature aggregation, often overlooking fine-scale dynamics and localized PDE behaviors essential for accurate solutions. To address these challenges, we propose the Locality-Aware Attention Transformer (LA2Former), which leverages K-nearest neighbors for dynamic patchifying and integrates global-local attention for enhanced PDE modeling. By combining linear attention for efficient global context encoding with pairwise attention for capturing intricate local interactions, LA2Former achieves an optimal balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. Extensive evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LA2Former improves predictive accuracy by over 50% relative to existing linear attention methods, while also outperforming full pairwise attention under optimal conditions. This work underscores the critical importance of localized feature learning in advancing Transformer-based neural operators for solving PDEs on complex and irregular domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

To this end, we present SigChord, an efficient physical layer inspection system built on low-cost and sub-Nyquist sampling radios. We first design a deep and rule-based interleaving algorithm based on Transformer network to perform spectrum sensing and signal recovery under sub-Nyquist sampling rate, and second, cascade protocol identifier and decoder based on Transformer neural networks to help physical layer packets analysis. We implement SigChord using software-defined radio platforms, and extensively evaluate it on over-the-air terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless signals. The experiments demonstrate that SigChord delivers over 99% accuracy in detecting and decoding, while still decreasing 34% sampling rate, compared with the SOTA approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 19 figures |

However, when faced with the task of processing extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) vehicle models, the lack of large-scale datasets and training resources, coupled with the inherent diversity and complexity of the geometry of different vehicle models, means that the prediction accuracy and versatility of these networks are still not up to the level required for current production. In view of the remarkable success of Transformer models in the field of natural language processing and their strong potential in the field of image processing, this study innovatively proposes a point cloud learning framework called DrivAer Transformer (DAT). The DAT structure uses the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which contains high-fidelity CFD data of industrial-standard 3D vehicle shapes. enabling accurate estimation of air drag directly from 3D meshes, thus avoiding the limitations of traditional methods such as 2D image rendering or signed distance fields (SDF). DAT enables fast and accurate drag prediction, driving the evolution of the aerodynamic evaluation process and laying the critical foundation for introducing a data-driven approach to automotive design. The framework is expected to accelerate the vehicle design process and improve development efficiency.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Although precise head geometry is crucial for applications like mesh reconstruction and relighting, current methods struggle to capture intricate geometric details and render unseen poses due to their reliance on similarity transformations, which cannot handle stretch and shear transforms essential for detailed deformations of geometry. To address this, we propose SurFhead, a novel method that reconstructs riggable head geometry from RGB videos using 2D Gaussian surfels, which offer well-defined geometric properties, such as precise depth from fixed ray intersections and normals derived from their surface orientation, making them advantageous over 3D counterparts. SurFhead ensures high-fidelity rendering of both normals and images, even in extreme poses, by leveraging classical mesh-based deformation transfer and affine transformation interpolation. SurFhead introduces precise geometric deformation and blends surfels through polar decomposition of transformations, including those affecting normals. Our key contribution lies in bridging classical graphics techniques, such as mesh-based deformation, with modern Gaussian primitives, achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction and rendering quality. Unlike previous avatar rendering approaches, SurFhead enables efficient reconstruction driven by Gaussian primitives while preserving high-fidelity geometry.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, Project page with videos: https://summertight.github.io/SurFhead/</p></details> |

Traditional lossy compression struggles to advance more in balancing compression ratio, data quality, and adaptability to diverse scientific data features. While deep learning-based solutions have been explored, their common practice of relying on large models and offline training limits adaptability to dynamic data characteristics and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose NeurLZ, a neural method designed to enhance lossy compression by integrating online learning, cross-field learning, and robust error regulation. Key innovations of NeurLZ include: (1) compression-time online neural learning with lightweight skipping DNN models, adapting to residual errors without costly offline pertaining, (2) the error-mitigating capability, recovering fine details from compression errors overlooked by conventional compressors, (3) $1\times$ and $2\times$ error-regulation modes, ensuring strict adherence to $1\times$ user-input error bounds strictly or relaxed 2$\times$ bounds for better overall quality, and (4) cross-field learning leveraging inter-field correlations in scientific data to improve conventional methods. Comprehensive evaluations on representative HPC datasets, e.g., Nyx, Miranda, Hurricane, against state-of-the-art compressors show NeurLZ's effectiveness. During the first five learning epochs, NeurLZ achieves an 89% bit rate reduction, with further optimization yielding up to around 94% reduction at equivalent distortion, significantly outperforming existing methods, demonstrating NeurLZ's superior performance in enhancing scientific lossy compression as a scalable and efficient solution.</p></details> | ICS 2025 |

This study reveals the effects of redistribution and consumption morals on wealth inequality and utility. To this end, we present a novel approach that couples the dynamic model of capital, consumption, and utility in macroeconomics with the interaction model of joint business and redistribution in econophysics. With this approach, we calculate the capital (wealth), the utility based on consumption, and the Gini index of these inequality using redistribution and consumption thresholds as moral parameters. The results show that: under-redistribution and waste exacerbate inequality; conversely, over-redistribution and stinginess reduce utility; and a balanced moderate moral leads to achieve both reduced inequality and increased utility. These findings provide renewed economic and numerical support for the moral importance known from philosophy, anthropology, and religion. The revival of redistribution and consumption morals should promote the transformation to a human mutual-aid economy, as indicated by philosopher and anthropologist, instead of the capitalist economy that has produced the current inequality. The practical challenge is to implement bottom-up social business, on a foothold of worker coops and platform cooperatives as a community against the state and the market, with moral consensus and its operation.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

In distributed learning, manual parallelism (MP) methods demand considerable human effort and have limited flexibility. Hence, automatic parallelism (AP) methods have recently been proposed for automating the parallel strategy optimization process. Existing AP methods suffer from sub-optimal solutions because they do not jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies (i.e., inter-layer parallelism and intra-layer parallelism). In this paper, we propose a novel AP method called UniAP, which unifies inter- and intra-layer automatic parallelism by mixed integer quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first parallel method that can jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies to find an optimal solution. Experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.80$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy optimization time by up to 107$\times$ across five Transformer-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this asymmetry, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), a framework that strategically decouples these phases by generating numerous rollouts in parallel but updating only on an informative subset. Within this framework, we develop max-variance down-sampling, a theoretically motivated method that selects rollouts with maximally diverse reward signals. We prove that this approach has an efficient algorithmic solution, and empirically demonstrate that GRPO with PODS using max-variance down-sampling achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on the GSM8K benchmark.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[High-Resolution Frame Interpolation with Patch-based Cascaded Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11838v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress, existing frame interpolation methods still struggle with processing extremely high resolution input and handling challenging cases such as repetitive textures, thin objects, and large motion. To address these issues, we introduce a patch-based cascaded pixel diffusion model for high resolution frame interpolation, HIFI, that excels in these scenarios while achieving competitive performance on standard benchmarks. Cascades, which generate a series of images from low to high resolution, can help significantly with large or complex motion that require both global context for a coarse solution and detailed context for high resolution output. However, contrary to prior work on cascaded diffusion models which perform diffusion on increasingly large resolutions, we use a single model that always performs diffusion at the same resolution and upsamples by processing patches of the inputs and the prior solution. At inference time, this drastically reduces memory usage and allows a single model, solving both frame interpolation (base model's task) and spatial up-sampling, saving training cost as well. HIFI excels at high-resolution images and complex repeated textures that require global context, achieving comparable or state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks (Vimeo, Xiph, X-Test, and SEPE-8K). We further introduce a new dataset, LaMoR, that focuses on particularly challenging cases, and HIFI significantly outperforms other baselines.

Our scheme builds on the existing theory of Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix operators that contain low-rank off-diagonal submatrices. We use proxy-based approximations of the far-field interactions and the Interpolative Decomposition (ID) to construct compressed HSS operators that are used as fast direct solvers for the original system. We describe a number of modifications to the standard HSS framework that enable compatibility with the QBX family of discretization methods. We establish an error model for the direct solver that is based on a multipole expansion of the QBX-mediated proxy interactions and standard estimates for the ID\@. Based on these theoretical results, we develop an automatic approach for setting scheme parameters based on user-provided error tolerances. The resulting solver seamlessly generalizes across two- and tree-dimensional problems and achieves state-of-the-art asymptotic scaling. We conclude with numerical experiments that support the theoretical expectations for the error and computational cost of the direct solver.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Fast Mixed-Precision Real Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11708v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating real-valued expressions to high precision is a key building block in computational mathematics, physics, and numerics. A typical implementation evaluates the whole expression in a uniform precision, doubling that precision until a sufficiently-accurate result is achieved. This is wasteful: usually only a few operations really need to be performed at high precision, and the bulk of the expression could be computed much faster. However, such non-uniform precision assignments have, to date, been impractical to compute. We propose a fast new algorithm for deriving such precision assignments. The algorithm leverages results computed at lower precisions to analytically determine a mixed-precision assignment that will result in a sufficiently-accurate result. Our implementation, Reval, achieves an average speed-up of 1.72x compared to the state-of-the-art Sollya tool, with the speed-up increasing to 5.21x on the most difficult input points. An examination of the precisions used with and without precision tuning shows that the speed-up results from assigning lower precisions for the majority of operations, though additional optimizations enabled by the non-uniform precision assignments also play a role.</p></details> | <details><summary>Dupli...</summary><p>Duplicates arxiv:2410.07468</p></details> |

LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.</p></details> | 49 pages |

Speech samples from Mandarin and American English L1 speakers were extracted from the GMU Speech Accent Archive, converted to WAV format, and processed to obtain thirteen MFCCs per speaker. A multi-method analytic framework combining inferential statistics (t-tests, MANOVA, Canonical Discriminant Analysis) and machine learning (Random Forest classification) identified MFCC-1 (broadband energy), MFCC-2 (first formant region), and MFCC-5 (voicing and fricative energy) as the most discriminative features for distinguishing L1 backgrounds. A reduced-feature model using these MFCCs significantly outperformed the full-feature model, as confirmed by McNemar's test and non-overlapping confidence intervals. The findings empirically support the Perceptual Assimilation Model for L2 (PAM-L2) and the Speech Learning Model (SLM), demonstrating that L1-conditioned variation in L2 speech is both perceptually grounded and acoustically quantifiable. Methodologically, the study contributes to applied linguistics and explainable AI by proposing a transparent, data-efficient pipeline for L2 pronunciation modeling.

In this paper, we introduce a cognitive model of epistemic language interpretation, grounded in Bayesian inferences about other agents' goals, beliefs, and intentions: a language-augmented Bayesian theory-of-mind (LaBToM). By translating natural language into an epistemic ``language-of-thought'' with grammar-constrained LLM decoding, then evaluating these translations against the inferences produced by inverting a generative model of rational action and perception, LaBToM captures graded plausibility judgments of epistemic claims. We validate our model in an experiment where participants watch an agent navigate a maze to find keys hidden in boxes needed to reach their goal, then rate sentences about the agent's beliefs. In contrast with multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro) and ablated models, our model correlates highly with human judgments for a wide range of expressions, including modal language, uncertainty expressions, knowledge claims, likelihood comparisons, and attributions of false belief.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages; Published at the Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL); Presented at NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Bayesian nonparametric approach to mediation and spillover effects with multiple mediators in cluster-randomized trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03489v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) with multiple unstructured mediators present significant methodological challenges for causal inference due to within-cluster correlation, interference among units, and the complexity introduced by multiple mediators. Existing causal mediation methods often fall short in simultaneously addressing these complexities, particularly in disentangling mediator-specific effects under interference that are central to studying complex mechanisms. To address this gap, we propose new causal estimands for spillover mediation effects that differentiate the roles of each individual's own mediator and the spillover effects resulting from interactions among individuals within the same cluster. We establish identification results for each estimand and, to flexibly model the complex data structures inherent in CRTs, we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric prior -- the Nested Dependent Dirichlet Process Mixture -- designed for flexibly capture the outcome and mediator surfaces at different levels. We conduct extensive simulations across various scenarios to evaluate the frequentist performance of our methods, compare them with a Bayesian parametric counterpart and illustrate our new methods in an analysis of a completed CRT.</p></details> | 94 pages |
| **[When is Task Vector Provably Effective for Model Editing? A Generalization Analysis of Nonlinear Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10957v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations. Although established in a conceptual setting, our theoretical findings were validated on a practical machine unlearning task using the large language model Phi-1.5 (1.3B).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025 as an oral paper</p></details> |

We develop a parallel 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) Stewart-Gough mechanism using Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) actuators. By using soft actuators, we are able to use one third as many mechatronic components as a rigid Stewart platform, while retaining a working payload of 2kg and an open-loop bandwidth greater than 16Hz. We show that the platform is capable of both precise tracing and dynamic disturbance rejection when controlling a ball and sliding puck using a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. We develop a machine-learning-based kinematics model and demonstrate a functional workspace of roughly 10cm in each translation direction and 28 degrees in each orientation. This 6DoF device has many of the characteristics associated with rigid components - power, speed, and total workspace - while capturing the advantages of soft mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Robosoft 2025</p></details> |

Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices' processing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the cloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited bandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes fast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches, which are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream, and therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only partially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or packet losses. In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image compression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's lightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission based on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run inference even with partial data availability. Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA, achieves 14.01 p.p. (percentage point) higher accuracy on ImageNet1000, 18.01 pp on CIFAR100, and 0.1 higher mAP@0.5 on COCO. Also, on average, LimitNet saves 61.24% bandwidth on ImageNet1000, 83.68% on CIFAR100, and 42.25% on the COCO dataset compared to SOTA, while it only has 4% more encoding time compared to JPEG (with a fixed quality) on STM32F7 (Cortex-M7).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's accepted manuscript.

Many existing tree-based causal inference techniques, however, exhibit high estimation errors when applied to observational data because they struggle to capture complex interactions among factors and rely on static regularization schemes. In this work, we propose Dynamic Regularized Causal Boosted Decision Trees (CBDT), a novel framework that integrates variance regularization and average treatment effect calibration into the loss function of gradient boosted decision trees. Our approach dynamically updates the regularization parameters using gradient statistics to better balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets and real-world clinical data demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves estimation accuracy while maintaining reliable coverage of true treatment effects. In an intensive care unit patient triage study, the method successfully identified clinically actionable rules and achieved high accuracy in treatment effect estimation. The results validate that dynamic regularization can effectively tighten error bounds and enhance both predictive performance and model interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version. 13 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We present CONTACT, a framework for territorial control prediction using large language models (LLMs) and minimal supervision. We evaluate two approaches: SetFit, an embedding-based few-shot classifier, and a prompt tuning method applied to BLOOMZ-560m, a multilingual generative LLM. Our model is trained on a small hand-labeled dataset of news articles covering ISIS activity in Syria and Iraq, using prompt-conditioned extraction of control-relevant signals such as military operations, casualties, and location references. We show that the BLOOMZ-based model outperforms the SetFit baseline, and that prompt-based supervision improves generalization in low-resource settings. CONTACT demonstrates that LLMs fine-tuned using few-shot methods can reduce annotation burdens and support structured inference from open-ended OSINT streams.

This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 14 pages |

The binomial and beta-binomial (BB) models are commonly used for bounded count data, with the BB model offering the advantage of accounting for potential overdispersion. However, extreme observations in real-world applications may hinder the performance of the BB model and lead to misleading inferences. To address this issue, we propose the contaminated beta-binomial (cBB) distribution (cBB-D), which provides the necessary flexibility to accommodate extreme observations. The cBB model accounts for overdispersion and extreme values while maintaining the mean and variance properties of the BB distribution. The availability of covariates that improve inference about the mean of the bounded count variable motivates the further proposal of the cBB regression model (cBB-RM). Different versions of the cBB-RM model - where none, some, or all of the cBB parameters are regressed on available covariates - are fitted to the datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

However, these approaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are essential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and recommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as personality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a comprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically assess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging realistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant limitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored dialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the User-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an Intrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in three stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to dynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a Brownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3) User-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response strategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning approach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and non-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning user-specific dialogue strategies. Results validate the protocol's utility and highlight UDP's robustness, adaptability, and potential to advance user-centric dialogue systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

By leveraging latent space representations and reducing the number of diffusion steps, SupResDiffGAN achieves significantly faster inference times than other diffusion-based super-resolution models while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. To prevent discriminator overfitting, we propose adaptive noise corruption, ensuring a stable balance between the generator and the discriminator during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional diffusion models such as SR3 and I$^2$SB in efficiency and image quality.

In this paper, we present a time scheduler that selects sampling points based on entropy rather than uniform time spacing, ensuring that each point contributes an equal amount of information to the final generation. We prove that this time reparameterization does not depend on the initial choice of time. Furthermore, we provide a tractable exact formula to estimate this \emph{entropic time} for a trained model using the training loss without substantial overhead. Alongside the entropic time, inspired by the optimality results, we introduce a rescaled entropic time. In our experiments with mixtures of Gaussian distributions and ImageNet, we show that using the (rescaled) entropic times greatly improves the inference performance of trained models. In particular, we found that the image quality in pretrained EDM2 models, as evaluated by FID and FD-DINO scores, can be substantially increased by the rescaled entropic time reparameterization without increasing the number of function evaluations, with greater improvements in the few NFEs regime.</p></details> | 17 pages |

In this paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro, ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks (RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F), explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full paper is accepted at IFIP Networking 2025</p></details> |

Fully soft robots often suffer from structural fragility and delayed sensory processing, limiting their practical functionality. The musculoskeletal system combines the adaptability of soft materials with the durability of rigid-body robots. It also leverages morphological computation, where the morphological structures contribute to information processing, for dynamic and adaptive behaviors. This study focuses on the pecking behaviors of birds, which enables precise haptic perception through the musculoskeletal system of their flexible neck. Physical reservoir computing is applied to flexible structures inspired by an ostrich neck to analyze the relationship between haptic perception and physical characteristics. Experiments with both a physical robot and simulations reveal that, with appropriate viscoelasticity, the flexible structure can discriminate object softness and retain that information through behavior. Drawing on these findings and anatomical insights from the ostrich neck, a haptic perception system is proposed that exhibits both separability and behavioral memory in flexible structures, enabling rapid learning and real-time inference. The results demonstrate that through the dynamics of flexible structures, diverse functions can emerge beyond their original design as manipulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper includes a figure of a dissected ostrich.

Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model of the comparison outcomes, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle the task of ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, existing inference-based ranking methods overwhelmingly choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we address this problem by developing a principled Bayesian methodology for learning partial rankings -- rankings with ties -- that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. Our framework is adaptable to any statistical ranking method in which the outcomes of pairwise observations depend on the ranks or scores of the items being compared. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, the presence of invalid instruments-even when numerous-can lead to biased causal estimates. We propose a novel identification strategy that remains valid even when all candidate instruments are invalid by leveraging genetic interactions that collectively explain substantial exposure variation. Recognizing that individual interaction effects may be weak, we develop MR-MAGIC (Mendelian Randomization with MAny weak Genetic Interactions for Causality), a robust method that simultaneously addresses instrument invalidity and improves estimation efficiency. MR-MAGIC provides consistent and asymptotically normal estimates under a many-weak-interactions asymptotic framework. Comprehensive simulations and applications to UK Biobank data demonstrate that MR-MAGIC outperforms conventional MR methods in practice, offering reliable causal inference when standard approaches fail.</p></details> | 33 pages, 2 figures |

However, current efforts are evaluated on disjoint benchmarks and settings, while their performances are significantly influenced by some trivial variables, such as prompt templates, data sampling, instructions, etc., which leads to significant inconsistencies in the results reported across various literature, preventing fair comparison or meta-analysis across different papers. Therefore, this paper proposes a standardized and easy-to-use evaluation toolkit (StaICC) for in-context classification. Including, for the normal classification task, we provide StaICC-Normal, selecting 10 widely used datasets, and generating prompts with a fixed form, to mitigate the variance among the experiment implementations. To enrich the usage of our benchmark, we also provide a sub-benchmark StaICC-Diag for diagnosing ICL from several aspects, aiming for a more robust inference processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

A potential solution is employing neuromorphic computing with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which leverages event-based computation to enable ultra-low power/energy ML algorithms. To maximize the performance efficiency of SNN inference, the In-Memory Computing (IMC)-based hardware accelerators with emerging device technologies (e.g., RRAM) can be employed. However, SNN models are typically developed without considering constraints from the application and the underlying IMC hardware, thereby hindering SNNs from reaching their full potential in performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose NeuroNAS, a novel framework for developing energyefficient neuromorphic IMC for intelligent mobile agents using hardware-aware spiking neural architecture search (NAS), i.e., by quickly finding an SNN architecture that offers high accuracy under the given constraints (e.g., memory, area, latency, and energy consumption). Its key steps include: optimizing SNN operations to enable efficient NAS, employing quantization to minimize the memory footprint, developing an SNN architecture that facilitates an effective learning, and devising a systematic hardware-aware search algorithm to meet the constraints. Compared to the state-of-the-art techniques, NeuroNAS quickly finds SNN architectures (with 8bit weight precision) that maintain high accuracy by up to 6.6x search time speed-ups, while achieving up to 92% area savings, 1.2x latency improvements, 84% energy savings across different datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200); while the state-of-the-art fail to meet all constraints at once.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In a separate line of work, structured parameter matrices with low displacement rank (LDR) -- which permit fast function and gradient evaluation -- have been used to create compact NNs, though primarily benefiting classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a framework based on symmetry-based structured matrices to build approximately equivariant NNs with fewer parameters. Our approach unifies the aforementioned areas using Group Matrices (GMs), a forgotten precursor to the modern notion of regular representations of finite groups. GMs allow the design of structured matrices similar to LDR matrices, which can generalize all the elementary operations of a CNN from cyclic groups to arbitrary finite groups. We show GMs can also generalize classical LDR theory to general discrete groups, enabling a natural formalism for approximate equivariance. We test GM-based architectures on various tasks with relaxed symmetry and find that our framework performs competitively with approximately equivariant NNs and other structured matrix-based methods, often with one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages.

This approach, however, has limited use in real-world applications. We instead propose a monitor and recover paradigm as a promising direction for future research. This philosophy emphasizes 1) robust safety monitoring instead of distribution shift detection and 2) distribution shift recovery instead of abstention.

Pattern graphs have recently been proposed as a tool to systematically relate various observed patterns in the sample. We extend its scope to the estimation of parameters defined by moment equations, including common regression models, via solving weighted estimating equations with weights constructed using a sequential balancing approach. These novel weights are carefully crafted to address the instability issue of the straightforward approach based on local balancing. We derive the efficiency bound for the model parameters and show that our proposed method, albeit relatively simple, is asymptotically efficient. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, and real-data applications illustrate how the results are robust to the choice of identification assumptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2402.08873</p></details> |

However, when faced with the task of processing extremely complex three-dimensional (3D) vehicle models, the lack of large-scale datasets and training resources, coupled with the inherent diversity and complexity of the geometry of different vehicle models, means that the prediction accuracy and versatility of these networks are still not up to the level required for current production. In view of the remarkable success of Transformer models in the field of natural language processing and their strong potential in the field of image processing, this study innovatively proposes a point cloud learning framework called DrivAer Transformer (DAT). The DAT structure uses the DrivAerNet++ dataset, which contains high-fidelity CFD data of industrial-standard 3D vehicle shapes. enabling accurate estimation of air drag directly from 3D meshes, thus avoiding the limitations of traditional methods such as 2D image rendering or signed distance fields (SDF). DAT enables fast and accurate drag prediction, driving the evolution of the aerodynamic evaluation process and laying the critical foundation for introducing a data-driven approach to automotive design. The framework is expected to accelerate the vehicle design process and improve development efficiency.</p></details> | 14 pages |

A Reverse MIPS-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13445v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The $k$-MIPS ($k$ Maximum Inner Product Search) problem has been employed in many fields. Recently, its reverse version, the reverse $k$-MIPS problem, has been proposed. Given an item vector (i.e., query), it retrieves all user vectors such that their $k$-MIPS results contain the item vector. Consider the cardinality of a reverse $k$-MIPS result. A large cardinality means that the item is potentially popular, because it is included in the $k$-MIPS results of many users. This mining is important in recommender systems, market analysis, and new item development. Motivated by this, we formulate a new problem. In this problem, the score of each item is defined as the cardinality of its reverse $k$-MIPS result, and the $N$ items with the highest score are retrieved. A straightforward approach is to compute the scores of all items, but this is clearly prohibitive for large numbers of users and items. We remove this inefficiency issue and propose a fast algorithm for this problem. Because the main bottleneck of the problem is to compute the score of each item, we devise a new upper-bounding technique that is specific to our problem and filters unnecessary score computations. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets and show the superiority of our algorithm over competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SSDBM2025</p></details> |

However, it is often not the dose-response curve but its derivative function that signals the treatment effect. In this paper, we investigate nonparametric inference on the derivative of the dose-response curve with and without the positivity condition. Under the positivity and other regularity conditions, we propose a doubly robust (DR) inference method for estimating the derivative of the dose-response curve using kernel smoothing. When the positivity condition is violated, we demonstrate the inconsistency of conventional inverse probability weighting (IPW) and DR estimators, and introduce novel bias-corrected IPW and DR estimators. In all settings, our DR estimator achieves asymptotic normality at the standard nonparametric rate of convergence with nonparametric efficiency guarantees. Additionally, our approach reveals an interesting connection to nonparametric support and level set estimation problems. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our proposed estimators through simulations and a case study of evaluating a job training program.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision with added nonparametric efficiency theory.

The bulk of the work, however, often focus on experiments with only quantitative inputs. In recent years, research on design and analysis for computer experiments have gain momentum. Statistical methodology for design, modeling and inference of such experiments have been developed. In this chapter, we review some of those key developments, and propose active learning approaches for modeling, optimization, contour estimation of computer experiments with both types of inputs. Numerical studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in comparison with other existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2504.05498</p></details> |
| **[JL1-CD: A New Benchmark for Remote Sensing Change Detection and a Robust Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13407v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved significant success in the field of remote sensing image change detection (CD), yet two major challenges remain: the scarcity of sub-meter, comprehensive open-source CD datasets, and the difficulty of achieving consistent and satisfactory detection results across images with varying change areas. To address these issues, we introduce the JL1-CD dataset, which consists of 5,000 pairs of 512 x 512 pixel images with a resolution of 0.5 to 0.75 meters. This all-inclusive dataset covers a wide range of human-induced and natural changes, including buildings, roads, hardened surfaces, woodlands, grasslands, croplands, water bodies, and photovoltaic panels, among others. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework that leverages the Origin-Partition (O-P) strategy to enhance CD performance. In the O-P strategy, we partition the training data based on the Change Area Ratio (CAR) to train separate models for small, medium, and large CAR values, alleviating the learning burden on each model and improving their performance within their respective partitions. Building upon this, our MTKD framework distills knowledge from multiple teacher models trained on different CAR partitions into a single student model,enabling the student model to achieve superior detection results across diverse CAR scenarios without incurring additional computational or time overhead during the inference phase. Experimental results on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets demonstrate that the MTKD framework significantly improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, achieving new state-of-the-art results. The JL1-CD dataset and code are available at https://github.com/circleLZY/MTKD-CD.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Their concerns are also shared by benchmark curators whose test-sets might be compromised. In this paper, we present STAMP, a framework for detecting dataset membership-i.e., determining the inclusion of a dataset in the pretraining corpora of LLMs. Given an original piece of content, our proposal involves first generating multiple rephrases, each embedding a watermark with a unique secret key. One version is to be released publicly, while others are to be kept private. Subsequently, creators can compare model likelihoods between public and private versions using paired statistical tests to prove membership. We show that our framework can successfully detect contamination across four benchmarks which appear only once in the training data and constitute less than 0.001% of the total tokens, outperforming several contamination detection and dataset inference baselines. We verify that STAMP preserves both the semantic meaning and the utility of the original data in comparing different models. We apply STAMP to two real-world scenarios to confirm the inclusion of paper abstracts and blog articles in the pretraining corpora.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DATA-FM, WMark @ ICLR 2025.

| **[How Breakable Is Privacy: Probing and Resisting Model Inversion Attacks in Collaborative Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00824v4)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative inference (CI) improves computational efficiency for edge devices by transmitting intermediate features to cloud models. However, this process inevitably exposes feature representations to model inversion attacks (MIAs), enabling unauthorized data reconstruction. Despite extensive research, there is no established criterion for assessing the difficulty of MIA implementation, leaving a fundamental question unanswered: \textit{What factors truly and verifiably determine the attack's success in CI?} Moreover, existing defenses lack the theoretical foundation described above, making it challenging to regulate feature information effectively while ensuring privacy and minimizing computational overhead. These shortcomings introduce three key challenges: theoretical gap, methodological limitation, and practical constraint. To overcome these challenges, we propose the first theoretical criterion to assess MIA difficulty in CI, identifying mutual information, entropy, and effective information volume as key influencing factors. The validity of this criterion is demonstrated by using the mutual information neural estimator. Building on this insight, we propose SiftFunnel, a privacy-preserving framework to resist MIA while maintaining usability. Specifically, we incorporate linear and non-linear correlation constraints alongside label smoothing to suppress redundant information transmission, effectively balancing privacy and usability. To enhance deployability, the edge model adopts a funnel-shaped structure with attention mechanisms, strengthening privacy while reducing computational and storage burdens. Experiments show that, compared to state-of-the-art defense, SiftFunnel increases reconstruction error by $\sim$30\%, lowers mutual and effective information metrics by $\geq$50\%, and reduces edge burdens by almost $20\times$, while maintaining comparable usability.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[EXAM: Exploiting Exclusive System-Level Cache in Apple M-Series SoCs for Enhanced Cache Occupancy Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13385v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cache occupancy attacks exploit the shared nature of cache hierarchies to infer a victim's activities by monitoring overall cache usage, unlike access-driven cache attacks that focus on specific cache lines or sets. There exists some prior work that target the last-level cache (LLC) of Intel processors, which is inclusive of higher-level caches, and L2 caches of ARM systems. In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple M-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the challenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy attacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other CPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the structure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and sharing through reverse engineering. We propose two attacks against websites. One is a coarse-grained fingerprinting attack, recognizing which website is accessed based on their different GPU memory access patterns monitored through the SLC occupancy channel. The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing attack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different pixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen capturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity of 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly expands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen display, posing a substantial new threat to system security. Our findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in Apple's M-series SoCs and emphasize the urgent need for effective countermeasures against cache occupancy attacks in heterogeneous computing environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM ASIA CCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[ES-FUZZ: Improving the Coverage of Firmware Fuzzing with Stateful and Adaptable MMIO Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06281v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gray-box fuzzing is widely used for testing embedded systems (ESes). State-of-the-art (SOTA) gray-box fuzzers test ES firmware in fully emulated environments without real peripherals. They emulate missing peripherals to achieve decent code coverage. Some fuzzers infer the memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) behavior of firmware peripherals from the firmware binary. We find that these fuzzers emulate the inferred MMIO behavior using stateless and non-adaptive MMIO models, which perform poorly in handling ES firmware's MMIO reads to collectively retrieve a data chunk. This leaves ample room for improving the code coverage of these fuzzers. We propose ES-Fuzz to improve the code coverage of each such fuzzer using stateful MMIO models that adapt to overcome the fuzzer's coverage bottlenecks. ES-Fuzz runs concurrently with a given fuzzer and starts a new run whenever the fuzzer's coverage stagnates. In each run, ES-Fuzz leverages a high-coverage test case to generate new stateful MMIO models that boost the coverage further. We have implemented ES-Fuzz upon Fuzzware and evaluated it with 24 popular ES firmware. ES-Fuzz is shown to enhance Fuzzware's coverage by up to 54% in 11 of them and trigger additional bugs in 5 of them without hurting the coverage in the remainder. ES-Fuzz's MMIO models are shown to describe a wide range of MMIO-retrieved data chunks and the firmware's usage of the same data chunk in various contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[VideoPanda: Video Panoramic Diffusion with Multi-view Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11389v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High resolution panoramic video content is paramount for immersive experiences in Virtual Reality, but is non-trivial to collect as it requires specialized equipment and intricate camera setups. In this work, we introduce VideoPanda, a novel approach for synthesizing 360$^\circ$ videos conditioned on text or single-view video data. VideoPanda leverages multi-view attention layers to augment a video diffusion model, enabling it to generate consistent multi-view videos that can be combined into immersive panoramic content. VideoPanda is trained jointly using two conditions: text-only and single-view video, and supports autoregressive generation of long-videos. To overcome the computational burden of multi-view video generation, we randomly subsample the duration and camera views used during training and show that the model is able to gracefully generalize to generating more frames during inference. Extensive evaluations on both real-world and synthetic video datasets demonstrate that VideoPanda generates more realistic and coherent 360$^\circ$ panoramas across all input conditions compared to existing methods.

| **[Cost-of-Pass: An Economic Framework for Evaluating Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13359v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of AI systems in the economy hinges on their ability to generate economic value that outweighs their inference costs. Evaluating this tradeoff requires metrics that account for both performance and costs. We propose a framework grounded in production theory for evaluating language models by combining accuracy and inference cost. We introduce "cost-of-pass", the expected monetary cost of generating a correct solution. We then define the "frontier cost-of-pass" as the minimum cost-of-pass achievable across available models or the "human-expert, using the approximate cost of hiring an expert. Our analysis reveals distinct economic insights. First, lightweight models are most cost-effective for basic quantitative tasks, large models for knowledge-intensive ones, and reasoning models for complex quantitative problems, despite higher per-token costs. Second, tracking this frontier cost-of-pass over the past year reveals significant progress, particularly for complex quantitative tasks where the cost has roughly halved every few months. Third, to trace key innovations driving this progress, we examine counterfactual frontiers: estimates of cost-efficiency without specific model classes. We find that innovations in lightweight, large, and reasoning models have been essential for pushing the frontier in basic quantitative, knowledge-intensive, and complex quantitative tasks, respectively. Finally, we assess the cost-reductions afforded by common inference-time techniques like majority voting and self-refinement, finding that their marginal accuracy gains rarely justify their costs. Our findings underscore that complementary model-level innovations are the primary drivers of cost-efficiency, and our economic framework provides a principled tool for measuring this progress and guiding deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/mhamzaerol/Cost-of-Pass</p></details> |

However, 3D object detectors are typically trained in a fully supervised way, relying extensively on 3D labeled data, which is labor-intensive and costly to annotate. This work focuses on weakly-supervised 3D detection to reduce data needs using a monocular method that leverages a singlecamera system over expensive LiDAR sensors or multi-camera setups. We propose a general model Weak Cube R-CNN, which can predict objects in 3D at inference time, requiring only 2D box annotations for training by exploiting the relationship between 2D projections of 3D cubes. Our proposed method utilizes pre-trained frozen foundation 2D models to estimate depth and orientation information on a training set. We use these estimated values as pseudo-ground truths during training. We design loss functions that avoid 3D labels by incorporating information from the external models into the loss. In this way, we aim to implicitly transfer knowledge from these large foundation 2D models without having access to 3D bounding box annotations. Experimental results on the SUN RGB-D dataset show increased performance in accuracy compared to an annotation time equalized Cube R-CNN baseline. While not precise for centimetre-level measurements, this method provides a strong foundation for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures.

To study a specific scenario, including patient-specific cases, model parameter sets must be found that accurately reproduce the dynamics of interest. To facilitate this complex and time-consuming process, we present an interactive browser-based tool that uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm implemented in JavaScript and taking advantage of the WebGL API for hardware acceleration. Our tool allows rapid customization and can find low-error fittings to user-provided voltage time series or action potential duration data from multiple cycle lengths in a few iterations (10-32), corresponding to a runtime of a few seconds on most machines. Additionally, our tool focuses on ease of use and flexibility, providing a webpage interface that allows users to select a subset of parameters to fit, set the range of values each parameter is allowed to assume, and control the PSO algorithm hyperparameters. We demonstrate our tool's utility by fitting a variety of models to different datasets, showing how convergence is affected by model choice, dataset properties, and PSO algorithmic settings, and explaining new insights gained about the physiological and dynamical roles of the model parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Darby...</summary><p>Darby I.

| **[Sleep-time Compute: Beyond Inference Scaling at Test-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13171v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key ingredient for enabling large language models (LLMs) to solve difficult problems, but comes with high latency and inference cost. We introduce sleep-time compute, which allows models to "think" offline about contexts before queries are presented: by anticipating what queries users might ask and pre-computing useful quantities, we can significantly reduce the compute requirements at test-time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we create modified versions of two reasoning tasks - Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME. We find that sleep-time compute can reduce the amount of test-time compute needed to achieve the same accuracy by ~ 5x on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME and that by scaling sleep-time compute we can further increase accuracy by up to 13% on Stateful GSM-Symbolic and 18% on Stateful AIME. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, which extends GSM-Symbolic by including multiple related queries per context. By amortizing sleep-time compute across related queries about the same context using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic, we can decrease the average cost per query by 2.5x. We then conduct additional analysis to understand when sleep-time compute is most effective, finding the predictability of the user query to be well correlated with the efficacy of sleep-time compute. Finally, we conduct a case-study of applying sleep-time compute to a realistic agentic SWE task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data released at: https://github.com/letta-ai/sleep-time-compute</p></details> |

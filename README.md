| **[FocalCodec-Stream: Streaming Low-Bitrate Speech Coding via Causal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16195v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio codecs are a fundamental component of modern generative audio pipelines. Although recent codecs achieve strong low-bitrate reconstruction and provide powerful representations for downstream tasks, most are non-streamable, limiting their use in real-time applications. We present FocalCodec-Stream, a hybrid codec based on focal modulation that compresses speech into a single binary codebook at 0.55 - 0.80 kbps with a theoretical latency of 80 ms. Our approach combines multi-stage causal distillation of WavLM with targeted architectural improvements, including a lightweight refiner module that enhances quality under latency constraints. Experiments show that FocalCodec-Stream outperforms existing streamable codecs at comparable bitrates, while preserving both semantic and acoustic information. The result is a favorable trade-off between reconstruction quality, downstream task performance, latency, and efficiency. Code and checkpoints will be released at https://github.com/lucadellalib/focalcodec.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

Building on Heim and Kratzer's syntax-based compositional semantic rules which utilizes lambda calculus, we develop a semantic parsing algorithm with abstract types, templated rules, and a dynamic component for interpreting entities within a context constructed from the input. The resulting logical forms are executed via constraint logic programming to determine which candidate statements can be logically deduced from the premises. The symbolic system, the Formal Semantic Logic Inferer (FSLI), provides a formally grounded, linguistically driven system for natural language logical deduction. We evaluate it on both synthetic and derived logical deduction problems. FSLI achieves 100% accuracy on BIG-bench's logical deduction task and 88% on a syntactically simplified subset of AR-LSAT outperforming an LLM baseline, o1-preview. While current research in natural language reasoning emphasizes neural language models, FSLI highlights the potential of principled, interpretable systems for symbolic logical deduction in NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 9 pages main paper and 8 pages references and appendix</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoders: Learning latent representations for quantum data generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16186v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce the Quantum Generative Adversarial Autoencoder (QGAA), a quantum model for generation of quantum data. The QGAA consists of two components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and (b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of the trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities. The utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a) generation of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized molecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies estimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in simulations upto 6 qubits. These results illustrate the potential of QGAA for quantum state generation, quantum chemistry, and near-term quantum machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |
| **[Fast OTSU Thresholding Using Bisection Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16179v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L) evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on 48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5 gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the original Otsu method.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 tables |
| **[FlightDiffusion: Revolutionising Autonomous Drone Training with Diffusion Models Generating FPV Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14082v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present FlightDiffusion, a diffusion-model-based framework for training autonomous drones from first-person view (FPV) video. Our model generates realistic video sequences from a single frame, enriched with corresponding action spaces to enable reasoning-driven navigation in dynamic environments. Beyond direct policy learning, FlightDiffusion leverages its generative capabilities to synthesize diverse FPV trajectories and state-action pairs, facilitating the creation of large-scale training datasets without the high cost of real-world data collection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the generated trajectories are physically plausible and executable, with a mean position error of 0.25 m (RMSE 0.28 m) and a mean orientation error of 0.19 rad (RMSE 0.24 rad). This approach enables improved policy learning and dataset scalability, leading to superior performance in downstream navigation tasks. Results in simulated environments highlight enhanced robustness, smoother trajectory planning, and adaptability to unseen conditions. An ANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference between performance in simulation and reality (F(1, 16) = 0.394, p = 0.541), with success rates of M = 0.628 (SD = 0.162) and M = 0.617 (SD = 0.177), respectively, indicating strong sim-to-real transfer. The generated datasets provide a valuable resource for future UAV research. This work introduces diffusion-based reasoning as a promising paradigm for unifying navigation, action generation, and data synthesis in aerial robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to conference</p></details> |
| **[UniMRSeg: Unified Modality-Relax Segmentation via Hierarchical Self-Supervised Compensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16170v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input, feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cache-of-Thought: Master-Apprentice Framework for Cost-Effective Vision Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20587v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of vision applications of increasing complexity and scales, yet choosing the right VLM model size involves a trade-off between response quality and cost. While smaller VLMs are cheaper to run, they typically produce responses only marginally better than random guessing on benchmarks such as MMMU. In this paper, we propose Cache of Thought (CoT), a master apprentice framework for collaborative inference between large and small VLMs. CoT manages high quality query results from large VLMs (master) in a cache, which are then selected via a novel multi modal retrieval and in-context learning to aid the performance of small VLMs (apprentice). We extensively evaluate CoT on various widely recognized and challenging general reasoning benchmarks, and show that CoT increases overall reasoning performance by up to 7.7% under the same budget, and specifically boosts the performance of apprentice VLMs by up to 36.6%. Our code is available at https://github.com/UIUC-MONET/Cache-of-Thoughts</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference.

| **[Robust Vision-Language Models via Tensor Decomposition: A Defense Against Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16163v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining. By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\% performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%. Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical, plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented as a poster at the Workshop on Safe and Trustworthy Multimodal AI Systems (SafeMM-AI), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Using Natural Language for Human-Robot Collaboration in the Real World](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11759v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem. In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally, we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

| **[A Rigorous Evaluation of LLM Data Generation Strategies for Low-Resource Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12158v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic textual data for training smaller specialized models. However, a comparison of various generation strategies for low-resource language settings is lacking. While various prompting strategies have been proposed, such as demonstrations, label-based summaries, and self-revision, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear, especially for low-resource languages. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of these generation strategies and their combinations across 11 typologically diverse languages, including several extremely low-resource ones. Using three NLP tasks and four open-source LLMs, we assess downstream model performance on generated versus gold-standard data. Our results show that strategic combinations of generation methods, particularly target-language demonstrations with LLM-based revisions, yield strong performance, narrowing the gap with real data to as little as 5% in some settings. We also find that smart prompting techniques can reduce the advantage of larger LLMs, highlighting efficient generation strategies for synthetic data generation in low-resource scenarios with smaller models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Robustifying Learning-Augmented Caching Efficiently without Compromising 1-Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16242v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The online caching problem aims to minimize cache misses when serving a sequence of requests under a limited cache size. While naive learning-augmented caching algorithms achieve ideal $1$-consistency, they lack robustness guarantees. Existing robustification methods either sacrifice $1$-consistency or introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce Guard, a lightweight robustification framework that enhances the robustness of a broad class of learning-augmented caching algorithms to $2H_k + 2$, while preserving their $1$-consistency. Guard achieves the current best-known trade-off between consistency and robustness, with only $O(1)$ additional per-request overhead, thereby maintaining the original time complexity of the base algorithm. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets and prediction models validate the effectiveness of Guard in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Strategic Analysis of Just-In-Time Liquidity Provision in Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16157v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liquidity providers (LPs) are essential figures in the operation of automated market makers (AMMs); in exchange for transaction fees, LPs lend the liquidity that allows AMMs to operate. While many prior works have studied the incentive structures of LPs in general, we currently lack a principled understanding of a special class of LPs known as Just-In-Time (JIT) LPs. These are strategic agents who momentarily supply liquidity for a single swap, in an attempt to extract disproportionately high fees relative to the remaining passive LPs. This paper provides the first formal, transaction-level model of JIT liquidity provision for a widespread class of AMMs known as Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs), as seen in Uniswap V3, for instance. We characterize the landscape of price impact and fee allocation in these systems, formulate and analyze a non-linear optimization problem faced by JIT LPs, and prove the existence of an optimal strategy. By fitting our optimal solution for JIT LPs to real-world CLMMs, we observe that in liquidity pools (particularly those with risky assets), there is a significant gap between observed and optimal JIT behavior. Existing JIT LPs often fail to account for price impact; doing so, we estimate they could increase earnings by up to 69% on average over small time windows. We also show that JIT liquidity, when deployed strategically, can improve market efficiency by reducing slippage for traders, albeit at the cost of eroding average passive LP profits by up to 44% per trade.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advances in Financial Technologies 2025 (AFT 2025), Pittsburgh, USA</p></details> |
| **[ConfReady: A RAG based Assistant and Dataset for Conference Checklist Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04675v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist website states that the "checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible research, addressing issues of research ethics, societal impact and reproducibility." Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering a checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, previous research has shown that self-reported checklist responses don't always accurately represent papers. In this work, we introduce ConfReady, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with conference checklists. To evaluate checklist assistants, we curate a dataset of 1,975 ACL checklist responses, analyze problems in human answers, and benchmark RAG and Large Language Model (LM) based systems on an evaluation subset. Our code is released under the AGPL-3.0 license on GitHub, with documentation covering the user interface and PyPI package.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Demo</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Elastic-Body Dynamics of Fish Swimming Using a Variational Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16145v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fish-inspired aquatic robots are gaining increasing attention in research communities due to their high swimming speeds and efficient propulsion enabled by flexible bodies that generate undulatory motions. To support the design optimizations and control of such systems, accurate, interpretable, and computationally tractable modeling of the underlying swimming dynamics is indispensable. In this letter, we present a full-body dynamics model for fish swimming, rigorously derived from Hamilton's principle. The model captures the continuously distributed elasticity of a deformable fish body undergoing large deformations and incorporates fluid-structure coupling effects, enabling self-propelled motion without prescribing kinematics. A preliminary parameter study explores the influence of actuation frequency and body stiffness on swimming speed and cost of transport (COT). Simulation results indicate that swimming speed and energy efficiency exhibit opposing trends with tail-beat frequency and that both body stiffness and body length have distinct optimal values. These findings provide insights into biological swimming mechanisms and inform the design of high-performance soft robotic swimmers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |
| **[AcT2I: Evaluating and Improving Action Depiction in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16141v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page : https://vatsal-malaviya.github.io/AcT2I/</p></details> |
| **[When Bugs Linger: A Study of Anomalous Resolution Time Outliers and Their Themes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16140v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient bug resolution is critical for maintaining software quality and user satisfaction. However, specific bug reports experience unusually long resolution times, which may indicate underlying process inefficiencies or complex issues. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of bug resolution anomalies across seven prominent open-source repositories: Cassandra, Firefox, Hadoop, HBase, SeaMonkey, Spark, and Thunderbird. Utilizing statistical methods such as Z-score and Interquartile Range (IQR), we identify anomalies in bug resolution durations. To understand the thematic nature of these anomalies, we apply Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for textual feature extraction and KMeans clustering to group similar bug summaries. Our findings reveal consistent patterns across projects, with anomalies often clustering around test failures, enhancement requests, and user interface issues. This approach provides actionable insights for project maintainers to prioritize and effectively address long-standing bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 tables, 21 figures</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal, multi-field deep learning of shock propagation in meso-structured media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16139v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected materials is a decisive factor in planetary defense, national security, and the race to achieve inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the success of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs about a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below 4\% in porous materials and below 10\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior single-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts while preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and temperature to within 5\%. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation, inertial fusion energy, and national security.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Near-field-free super-potential FFT method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04489v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a spectrally accurate, efficient FFT-based method for the three-dimensional free-space Poisson equation with smooth, compactly supported sources. The method adopts a super-potential formulation: we first compute the convolution with the biharmonic Green's function, then recover the potential by spectral differentiation, applying the Laplacian in Fourier space. A separable Gaussian-sum (GS) approximation enables efficient precomputation and quasi-linear, FFT-based convolution. Owing to the biharmonic kernel's improved regularity, the GS cutoff error is fourth-order, uniform for all target points, eliminating the near-field corrections and Taylor expansions required in standard GS/Ewald-type methods. Benchmarks on Gaussian, oscillatory, and compactly supported densities reach the double-precision limit and, at matched accuracy on the same hardware, reduce both error and per-solve runtime relative to our original GS-based scheme. The resulting method is simple, reproducible, and efficient for three-dimensional free-space Poisson problems with smooth sources on uniform grids.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figure |
| **[Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion mitigation and accident risk prediction. While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns. By combining these two components, DDCN effectively captures both non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DDCN achieves competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing computational costs, underscoring its potential for large-scale and real-time deployment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Recovering Parametric Scenes from Very Few Time-of-Flight Pixels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16132v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors. These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Efficient Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis for expensive and non-differentiable physics-based simulations in high stochastic dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24708v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional Bayesian inverse analysis (dim >> 100) is mostly unfeasible for computationally demanding, nonlinear physics-based high-fidelity (HF) models. Usually, the use of more efficient gradient-based inference schemes is impeded if the multi-physics models are provided by complex legacy codes. Adjoint-based derivatives are either exceedingly cumbersome to derive or non-existent for practically relevant large-scale nonlinear and coupled multi-physics problems. Similarly, holistic automated differentiation w.r.t. primary variables of multi-physics codes is usually not yet an option and requires extensive code restructuring if not considered from the outset in the software design. This absence of differentiability further exacerbates the already present computational challenges. To overcome the existing limitations, we propose a novel inference approach called Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA), which leverages simpler and computationally cheaper lower-fidelity (LF) models that are designed to provide model derivatives. BMFIA learns a simple, probabilistic dependence of the LF and HF models, which is then employed in an altered likelihood formulation to statistically correct the inaccurate LF response. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this dependence represents a multi-fidelity conditional density (discriminative model). We demonstrate how this multi-fidelity conditional density can be learned robustly in the small data regime from only a few HF and LF simulations (50 to 300), which would not be sufficient for naive surrogate approaches. The formulation is fully differentiable and allows the flexible design of a wide range of LF models.</p></details> | 40 pages, 20 figures |

We present new theoretical and practical approaches for addressing directional conflicts between loss terms, demonstrating their effectiveness in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) where such conflicts are particularly challenging to resolve. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how these conflicts limit first-order methods and show that second-order optimization naturally resolves them through implicit gradient alignment. We prove that SOAP, a recently proposed quasi-Newton method, efficiently approximates the Hessian preconditioner, enabling breakthrough performance in PINNs: state-of-the-art results on 10 challenging PDE benchmarks, including the first successful application to turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers up to 10,000, with 2-10x accuracy improvements over existing methods. We also introduce a novel gradient alignment score that generalizes cosine similarity to multiple gradients, providing a practical tool for analyzing optimization dynamics. Our findings establish frameworks for understanding and resolving gradient conflicts, with broad implications for optimization beyond scientific computing.</p></details> | 39 pages, 22 figures |

Prior work has addressed this task when the process has finite memory. However, the more general regime in which the system probabilistically "jumps back in time" - so that the state at t+1 depends on a sample from a distant past t-d - remains unexplored. The process with probabilistic resets can be modeled as a Markov process with memory, but estimations become computationally expensive. To tackle this, we introduce PIMRecGreedy, a modification of the RecGreedy algorithm originally designed for i.i.d. samples. The proposed method does not assume memory, requires no prior knowledge of d, and recovers G with high probability even without access to the specific time indices at which such temporal jumps occur, and without imposing any constraints on the graph structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sampl...</summary><p>Sample complexity proof included</p></details> |
| **[Automated CGRA Design with Multi-Agent LLMs: A Unified Hardware-Software Co-Design Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13557v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coarse-grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are a promising computing architecture that can deliver high-performance, energy-efficient acceleration across diverse domains. By supporting reconfiguration at the functional unit level, CGRAs efficiently adapt to varying computational patterns and optimize resource utilization. However, designing CGRAs is highly challenging due to the vast design space, independent architectural parameters, and the time-consuming nature of manual design. Fortunately, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to automate this process. In this work, we propose MACO -- an open-source multi-agent LLM-based framework for Hardware/Software (HW/SW) co-design of CGRAs. The framework employs LLM reasoning to generate CGRAs across four stages: HW/SW co-design, Design error correction, Best design selection, and Evaluation & Feedback. Furthermore, MACO iteratively optimizes the generated CGRAs, leveraging agent reasoning and feedback to achieve higher PPA (that is, power, performance, and area) design points for a given domain. In addition, we introduce an LLM self-learning mechanism that employs LLM-driven decision making to select the optimal CGRA to accelerate the design process. We evaluate the framework with state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and manual CGRA design, in terms of performance, power consumption, and area. Experimental results show that MACO efficiently generates high-quality CGRA architectures, significantly reducing manual design effort and demonstrating the potential of our framework for real-world CGRA design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to certain confidentiality requirements, this article needs to be withdrawn</p></details> |

Such models are often approximations and introduce systematic errors leading to a bias of the posterior distribution in Bayesian inversion. We propose a unified framework that combines transport maps from a reference distribution to the posterior distribution with the model error approach. This leads to an adaptive algorithm that jointly estimates the posterior distribution of the measurand and the model error. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated on two model problems, showing that the approach effectively corrects biases while enabling fast sampling.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Negotiated Representations to Prevent Overfitting in Machine Learning Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11410v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is trained for too long and focused too much on the exact fitness of the training samples to the provided training labels and cannot keep track of the predictive rules that would be useful on the test data. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to memorization of particular samples, memorization of the noise, and forced fitness into a data set of limited samples by using a high number of neurons. While it is true that the model encodes various peculiarities as the training process continues, we argue that most of the overfitting occurs in the process of reconciling sharply defined membership ratios. In this study, we present an approach that increases the classification accuracy of machine learning models by allowing the model to negotiate output representations of the samples with previously determined class labels. By setting up a negotiation between the models interpretation of the inputs and the provided labels, we not only increased average classification accuracy but also decreased the rate of overfitting without applying any other regularization tricks. By implementing our negotiation paradigm approach to several low regime machine learning problems by generating overfitting scenarios from publicly available data sets such as CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and MNIST we have demonstrated that the proposed paradigm has more capacity than its intended purpose. We are sharing the experimental results and inviting the machine learning community to explore the limits of the proposed paradigm. We also aim to incentive the community to exploit the negotiation paradigm to overcome the learning related challenges in other research fields such as continual learning. The Python code of the experimental setup is uploaded to GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Research on anomaly detection is constrained by the availability of datasets that capture complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical of production processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of their applicability in real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection Dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. Beyond benchmarking recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training strategy, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Experiments show that even a small amount of injected, weakly labeled real defects improves generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Overall, our findings indicate that model-free synthetic defects can provide a cold-start baseline, whereas a small number of injected real defects refine the decision boundary for previously unseen defect characteristics. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 6 figures, Revised version submitted to the Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, the dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14911042</p></details> |

Recent strides in Code Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned BestFit reranking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks ReccEval and CCEval demonstrate that CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Traditionally, acceptance in such automata is defined based on the set of states visited infinitely often during a run. However, there is a growing trend towards defining acceptance based on transitions rather than states. In this survey, we analyse the reasons for this shift and advocate using transition-based acceptance in the context of automata over infinite words.

Therefore, we systematically investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can leverage commonsense to resolve referential ambiguity in multi-turn conversations and analyze their behavior when ambiguity persists. Further, we study how requests for simplified language affect this capacity. Using a novel multilingual evaluation dataset, we test DeepSeek v3, GPT-4o, Qwen3-32B, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.1-8B via LLM-as-Judge and human annotations. Our findings indicate that current LLMs struggle to resolve ambiguity effectively: they tend to commit to a single interpretation or cover all possible references, rather than hedging or seeking clarification. This limitation becomes more pronounced under simplification prompts, which drastically reduce the use of commonsense reasoning and diverse response strategies. Fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B with Direct Preference Optimization substantially improves ambiguity resolution across all request types. These results underscore the need for advanced fine-tuning to improve LLMs' handling of ambiguity and to ensure robust performance across diverse communication styles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by UncertaiNLP workshop @ EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Although recent codecs achieve strong low-bitrate reconstruction and provide powerful representations for downstream tasks, most are non-streamable, limiting their use in real-time applications. We present FocalCodec-Stream, a hybrid codec based on focal modulation that compresses speech into a single binary codebook at 0.55 - 0.80 kbps with a theoretical latency of 80 ms. Our approach combines multi-stage causal distillation of WavLM with targeted architectural improvements, including a lightweight refiner module that enhances quality under latency constraints. Experiments show that FocalCodec-Stream outperforms existing streamable codecs at comparable bitrates, while preserving both semantic and acoustic information. The result is a favorable trade-off between reconstruction quality, downstream task performance, latency, and efficiency.

Building on Heim and Kratzer's syntax-based compositional semantic rules which utilizes lambda calculus, we develop a semantic parsing algorithm with abstract types, templated rules, and a dynamic component for interpreting entities within a context constructed from the input. The resulting logical forms are executed via constraint logic programming to determine which candidate statements can be logically deduced from the premises. The symbolic system, the Formal Semantic Logic Inferer (FSLI), provides a formally grounded, linguistically driven system for natural language logical deduction. We evaluate it on both synthetic and derived logical deduction problems. FSLI achieves 100% accuracy on BIG-bench's logical deduction task and 88% on a syntactically simplified subset of AR-LSAT outperforming an LLM baseline, o1-preview. While current research in natural language reasoning emphasizes neural language models, FSLI highlights the potential of principled, interpretable systems for symbolic logical deduction in NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 9 pages main paper and 8 pages references and appendix</p></details> |

The QGAA consists of two components: (a) Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) to compress quantum states, and (b) Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) to learn the latent space of the trained QAE. This approach imparts the QAE with generative capabilities. The utility of QGAA is demonstrated in two representative scenarios: (a) generation of pure entangled states, and (b) generation of parameterized molecular ground states for H$_2$ and LiH. The average errors in the energies estimated by the trained QGAA are 0.02 Ha for H$_2$ and 0.06 Ha for LiH in simulations upto 6 qubits. These results illustrate the potential of QGAA for quantum state generation, quantum chemistry, and near-term quantum machine learning applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 28 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous Hugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the success of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations. We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that unifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy, material distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs about a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below 4\% in porous materials and below 10\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior single-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts while preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and temperature to within 5\%. This advance transforms problems once considered intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation, inertial fusion energy, and national security.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Existing MoE pruning methods, which involve reducing parameter size with a uniform sparsity across all layers, often lead to suboptimal outcomes and performance degradation due to varying expert redundancy in different MoE layers. To address this, we propose a non-uniform pruning strategy, dubbed \textbf{Di}fferentiable \textbf{E}xpert \textbf{P}runing (\textbf{DiEP}), which adaptively adjusts pruning rates at the layer level while jointly learning inter-layer importance, effectively capturing the varying redundancy across different MoE layers. By transforming the global discrete search space into a continuous one, our method handles exponentially growing non-uniform expert combinations, enabling adaptive gradient-based pruning. Extensive experiments on five advanced MoE models demonstrate the efficacy of our method across various NLP tasks. Notably, \textbf{DiEP} retains around 92\% of original performance on Mixtral 8$\times$7B with only half the experts, outperforming other pruning methods by up to 7.1\% on the challenging MMLU dataset.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Our approach integrates heat-kernel coefficients adapted from quantum field theory with Tucker decomposition and canonical polyadic decomposition (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) to transform conventional distance metrics and efficiently represent high-dimensional multi-view structures. The framework employs matriculation and vectorization techniques to facilitate the discovery of hidden structures and multilinear relationships via N-way generalized tensors. The proposed method introduces a dual-level optimization scheme: local heat-kernel enhanced fuzzy clustering with tensor decomposition operating on order-N input tensors, and federated aggregation of tensor factors with privacy-preserving personalization mechanisms. The local stage employs tensorized kernel Euclidean distance transformations and Tucker decomposition to discover client-specific patterns in multi-view tensor data, while the global aggregation process coordinates tensor factors (core tensors and factor matrices) across clients through differential privacy-preserving protocols. This tensorized approach enables efficient handling of high-dimensional multi-view data with significant communication savings through low-rank tensor approximations.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 algorithms, and 3 figures</p></details> |

However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios. The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data. Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages,11 figures,1 table</p></details> |

Existing deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g., transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP> tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP> tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively. Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the <ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then, we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in GAD taks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

We propose MUG-Eval, a novel framework that evaluates LLMs' multilingual generation capabilities by transforming existing benchmarks into conversational tasks and measuring the LLMs' accuracies on those tasks. We specifically designed these conversational tasks to require effective communication in the target language. Then, we simply use task success rate as a proxy for successful conversation generation. Our approach offers two key advantages: it is independent of language-specific NLP tools or annotated datasets, which are limited for most languages, and it does not rely on LLMs-as-judges, whose evaluation quality degrades outside a few high-resource languages. We evaluate 8 LLMs across 30 languages spanning high, mid, and low-resource categories, and we find that MUG-Eval correlates strongly with established benchmarks ($r$ > 0.75) while enabling standardized comparisons across languages and models. Our framework provides a robust and resource-efficient solution for evaluating multilingual generation that can be extended to thousands of languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation (SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology. SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space, improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures, offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been updated and now utilizes a more comprehensive methodology, we felt that the name does not do justice to it as their is no graph rewiring involved.

While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our Middo consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level, easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in end-to-end training throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf</p></details> |

As in hardmax, uniform weights are determined by a parameter controlling neighbor influence, but the key extension lies in relaxing neighborhood interactions through an alignment-sensitivity parameter, which allows controlled deviations from pure hardmax behavior. As we prove, while the convex hull of the token states still converges to a convex polytope, its structure can no longer be fully described by a maximal alignment set, prompting the introduction of quiescent sets to capture the invariant behavior of tokens near vertices. We show that these sets play a key role in understanding the asymptotic behavior of the system, even under time-varying alignment sensitivity parameters. We further show that localmax dynamics does not exhibit finite-time convergence and provide results for vanishing, nonzero, time-varying alignment-sensitivity parameters, recovering the limiting behavior of hardmax as a by-product. Finally, we adapt Lyapunov-based methods from classical opinion dynamics, highlighting their limitations in the asymmetric setting of localmax interactions and outlining directions for future research.</p></details> | 28 pages, 5 figures |

Yet, it remains underexplored compared to segmentation, where pre-training has already demonstrated significant benefits. Existing pre-training approaches for 3D object detection rely on 2D medical data or natural image pre-training, failing to fully leverage 3D volumetric information. In this work, we present the first systematic study of how existing pre-training methods can be integrated into state-of-the-art detection architectures, covering both CNNs and Transformers. Our results show that pre-training consistently improves detection performance across various tasks and datasets.

| **[Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Networks for Reliable Transformer Prognostics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15933v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates physics and data into the learning process, offering improved generalization compared with purely data-driven models. Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance decision-making in critical power assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Annual Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) Society Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Assessing invariance to affine transformations in image quality metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17927v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subjective image quality metrics are usually evaluated according to the correlation with human opinion in databases with distortions that may appear in digital media. However, these oversee affine transformations which may represent better the changes in the images actually happening in natural conditions. Humans can be particularly invariant to these natural transformations, as opposed to the digital ones. In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate any image quality metric by assessing their invariance to affine transformations, specifically: rotation, translation, scaling, and changes in spectral illumination. Here, invariance refers to the fact that certain distances should be neglected if their values are below a threshold. This is what we call invisibility threshold of a metric. Our methodology consists of two elements: (1) the determination of a visibility threshold in a subjective representation common to every metric, and (2) a transduction from the distance values of the metric and this common representation. This common representation is based on subjective ratings of readily available image quality databases. We determine the threshold in such common representation (the first element) using accurate psychophysics. Then, the transduction (the second element) can be trivially fitted for any metric: with the provided threshold extension of the method to any metric is straightforward. We test our methodology with some well-established metrics and find that none of them show human-like invisibility thresholds. This means that tuning the models exclusively to predict the visibility of generic distortions may disregard other properties of human vision as for instance invariances or invisibility thresholds. The data and code are publicly available to test other metrics.</p></details> | 25 pages 41 figures |

Speech enhancement aims to mitigate these issues by generating clean high-fidelity signals. While recent generative approaches for speech enhancement have shown promising results, they still face two major challenges: (1) content hallucination, where plausible phonemes generated differ from the original utterance; and (2) inconsistency, failing to preserve speaker's identity and paralinguistic features from the input speech. In this work, we introduce DiTSE (Diffusion Transformer for Speech Enhancement), which addresses quality issues of degraded speech in full bandwidth. Our approach employs a latent diffusion transformer model together with robust conditioning features, effectively addressing these challenges while remaining computationally efficient. Experimental results from both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that DiTSE achieves state-of-the-art audio quality that, for the first time, matches real studio-quality audio from the DAPS dataset. Furthermore, DiTSE significantly improves the preservation of speaker identity and content fidelity, reducing hallucinations across datasets compared to state-of-the-art enhancers.

However, conventional KD methods train the student to mimic the teacher's output entirely, which forces the student to imitate the regions where the teacher performs poorly and to apply distillation to the regions where the student already performs well, which yields only marginal gains. We propose Distilling Selective Patches (DISPatch), a KD framework for speech enhancement that applies the distillation loss to spectrogram patches where the teacher outperforms the student, as determined by a Knowledge Gap Score. This approach guides optimization toward areas with the most significant potential for student improvement while minimizing the influence of regions where the teacher may provide unreliable instruction. Furthermore, we introduce Multi-Scale Selective Patches (MSSP), a frequency-dependent method that uses different patch sizes across low- and high-frequency bands to account for spectral heterogeneity. We incorporate DISPatch into conventional KD methods and observe consistent gains in compact students. Moreover, integrating DISPatch and MSSP into a state-of-the-art frequency-dependent KD method considerably improves performance across all metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, their immense capacity often leads to overfitting, especially when training data is limited or noisy. In this research, a unified family of stochastic regularization techniques has been proposed, i.e. AttentionDrop with its three different variants, which operate directly on the self-attention distributions. Hard Attention Masking randomly zeroes out top-k attention logits per query to encourage diverse context utilization, Blurred Attention Smoothing applies a dynamic Gaussian convolution over attention logits to diffuse overly peaked distributions, and Consistency-Regularized AttentionDrop enforces output stability under multiple independent AttentionDrop perturbations via a KL-based consistency loss. Results achieved in the study demonstrate that AttentionDrop consistently improves accuracy, calibration, and adversarial robustness over standard Dropout, DropConnect, and R-Drop baselines</p></details> | 25 pages |

It shifts the focus from data fidelity to goal-oriented or task-oriented semantic transmission. While deep learning-based methods are commonly used for semantic encoding and decoding, they struggle with the sequential nature of time series data and high computation cost, particularly in resource-constrained IoT environments. Data compression plays a crucial role in reducing transmission and storage costs, yet traditional data compression methods fall short of the demands of goal-oriented communication systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct analytics on time series data compressed by the SHRINK compression algorithm. Through experimentation using outlier detection as a case study, we show that our method outperforms baselines running on uncompressed data in multiple cases, with merely 1% difference in the worst case. Additionally, it achieves four times lower runtime on average and accesses approximately 10% of the data volume, which enables edge analytics with limited storage and computation power. These results demonstrate that our approach offers reliable, high-speed outlier detection analytics for diverse IoT applications while extracting semantics from time-series data, achieving high compression, and reducing data transmission.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of arXiv:2503.13246, with significant additional contributions</p></details> |

This framework is applied to two important generalized forms of the equation: a parabolic equation with singular properties on the unit disk and a continuity equation. The study enhances the alignment of numerical simulations with physical characteristics through polar coordinate transformation and variable drift-diffusion coefficients. Innovatively, a multidimensional adaptive mesh partitioning strategy for radius-angle-time is designed and combined with an adjustable finite difference scheme to construct a highly adaptive numerical simulation method. In the construction of discrete schemes, the Swartztrauber-Sweet method and the control volume method are employed to effectively eliminate the origin singularity caused by polar coordinate transformation. On the programming front, a parallelized MATLAB algorithm is developed to optimize code execution efficiency. Numerical comparative experiments demonstrate that the adaptive method improves the accuracy of the parabolic equation by 1 to 7 times and that of the continuity equation by 10% to 70% while maintaining computational efficiency, significantly enhancing numerical simulation accuracy with high stability. Furthermore, this study systematically verifies the algorithm's convergence, stability, and parameter sensitivity using error visualization and other means. It also explores optimal parameters and establishes tuning optimization criteria. The research provides theoretical support for high-precision and highly adaptive methods in semiconductor device simulation, demonstrating outstanding advantages in handling singular regions.</p></details> | 56 pages; 34 figures |

However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

Using a systematic, data-driven approach, we analyze research trends from 1994 to 2024, identifying key developments in data fusion, remote sensing, and AI-driven agricultural monitoring. While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in agricultural decision-making, challenges such as limited scalability, suboptimal feature extraction, and reliance on extensive labeled data persist. This study examines the comparative advantages of Transformer-based fusion methods, particularly their ability to model spatiotemporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous datasets for applications in soil analysis, crop classification, yield prediction, and disease detection. A comparative analysis of multimodal data fusion approaches is conducted, evaluating data types, fusion techniques, and remote sensing platforms. We demonstrate how Transformers outperform conventional models by enhancing prediction accuracy, mitigating feature redundancy, and optimizing large-scale data integration. Furthermore, we propose a structured roadmap for implementing data fusion in agricultural remote sensing, outlining best practices for ground-truth data selection, platform integration, and fusion model design. By addressing key research gaps and providing a strategic framework, this review offers valuable insights for advancing precision agriculture through AI-driven data fusion techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, Journal</p></details> |

While recent work has explored a similar decomposition of an observational measure, we argue that a proper causal decomposition must be interventional in nature. We develop a mathematical approach that systematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a system, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the M\"obius function of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by decomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, chemical reaction networks, and a transformer language model. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can be context- and parameter-dependent. The decomposition provides new insights into complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined among multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution of responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological networks or climate models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

To mitigate these risks and to comply with privacy regulations, Federated Unlearning (FU) has been introduced to enable participants in FL systems to remove their data's influence from the global model. However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to efficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks. We argue that effective unlearning necessitates a paradigm shift: designing FL systems inherently amenable to forgetting. To this end, we propose a learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information, directly simplifying subsequent unlearning. Crucially, ToFU can work as a plug-and-play framework that improves the performance of existing FU methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the MUFAC benchmark show that ToFU outperforms existing FU baselines, enhances performance when integrated with current methods, and reduces unlearning time.</p></details> | ECAI-2025 |

Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods. Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data. Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 9 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |

Conventional methods, constrained by uniform 2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel $\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive $\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position, and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding, Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks, followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128 tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at $\href{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}{https://github.com/xtudbxk/GPSToken}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NIPS 2025</p></details> |

While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40.

However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels, which enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code will be released soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under continuous improvement</p></details> |

To evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models pre-trained on this data.

In this contribution, we propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. We further identify that image-based 3D reconstruction and albedo estimation (Shape and Albedo from Shading) of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal learning to solve Shape and Albedo from Shading and provide a new approach for large-scale planetary 3D reconstruction. Adding more input modalities in the future will further improve the results and enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.</p></details> | 48pages |

While various compression strategies have been explored, sequence-level compression, which drops the full KV caches for certain tokens, is particularly challenging as it can lead to the loss of important contextual information. To address this, we introduce UniGist, a sequence-level long-context compression framework that efficiently preserves context information by replacing raw tokens with special compression tokens (gists) in a fine-grained manner. We adopt a chunk-free training strategy and design an efficient kernel with a gist shift trick, enabling optimized GPU training. Our scheme also supports flexible inference by allowing the actual removal of compressed tokens, resulting in real-time memory savings. Experiments across multiple long-context tasks demonstrate that UniGist significantly improves compression quality, with especially strong performance in detail-recalling tasks and long-range dependency modeling.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-gated deformable network to leverage the complementary information from CNN and Transformers. Specifically, we incorporates deformable feature modeling into both convolution and attention modules, enabling adaptive receptive fields for irregular tumor contours. We also design an Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module (U-GEM) to selectively exchange complementary features between CNN and Transformer based on pixel-wise uncertainty, enhancing both local and global representations. Additionally, a Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss is introduced to further improve tumor boundary delineation. Comprehensive experiments on two clinical breast MRI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its clinical potential for accurate breast tumor delineation.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Hybrid Lie semi-group and cascade structures for the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15748v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of freedom in the image transformations. This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships, roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales, structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional preferences. The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological vision.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |

In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NIPS 2025</p></details> |

Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption.

In this study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites, and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar (CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU.

| **[TT-DF: A Large-Scale Diffusion-Based Dataset and Benchmark for Human Body Forgery Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08437v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence and popularity of facial deepfake methods spur the vigorous development of deepfake datasets and facial forgery detection, which to some extent alleviates the security concerns about facial-related artificial intelligence technologies. However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

However, their real-world application in SOCs remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present a longitudinal study of 3,090 analyst queries from 45 SOC analysts over 10 months. Our analysis reveals that analysts use LLMs as on-demand aids for sensemaking and context-building, rather than for making high-stakes determinations, preserving analyst decision authority. The majority of queries are related to interpreting low-level telemetry (e.g., commands) and refining technical communication through short (1-3 turn) interactions. Notably, 93% of queries align with established cybersecurity competencies (NICE Framework), underscoring the relevance of LLM use for SOC-related tasks. Despite variations in tasks and engagement, usage trends indicate a shift from occasional exploration to routine integration, with growing adoption and sustained use among a subset of analysts. We find that LLMs function as flexible, on-demand cognitive aids that augment, rather than replace, SOC expertise. Our study provides actionable guidance for designing context-aware, human-centred AI assistance in security operations, highlighting the need for further in-the-wild research on real-world analyst-LLM collaboration, challenges, and impacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 9 figures, under review</p></details> |

While existing research has examined how well SLMs encode shallow acoustic and phonetic features, the extent to which SLMs encode nuanced syntactic and conceptual features remains unclear. By drawing parallels with linguistic competence assessments for large language models, this study is the first to systematically evaluate the presence of contextual syntactic and semantic features across SLMs for self-supervised learning (S3M), automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech compression (codec), and as the encoder for auditory large language models (AudioLLMs). Through minimal pair designs and diagnostic feature analysis across 71 tasks spanning diverse linguistic levels, our layer-wise and time-resolved analysis uncovers that 1) all speech encode grammatical features more robustly than conceptual ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |

Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 40.2% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.28 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D.. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

Building on Heim and Kratzer's syntax-based compositional semantic rules which utilizes lambda calculus, we develop a semantic parsing algorithm with abstract types, templated rules, and a dynamic component for interpreting entities within a context constructed from the input. The resulting logical forms are executed via constraint logic programming to determine which candidate statements can be logically deduced from the premises. The symbolic system, the Formal Semantic Logic Inferer (FSLI), provides a formally grounded, linguistically driven system for natural language logical deduction. We evaluate it on both synthetic and derived logical deduction problems. FSLI achieves 100% accuracy on BIG-bench's logical deduction task and 88% on a syntactically simplified subset of AR-LSAT outperforming an LLM baseline, o1-preview. While current research in natural language reasoning emphasizes neural language models, FSLI highlights the potential of principled, interpretable systems for symbolic logical deduction in NLP.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 fig...</summary><p>3 figures, 9 pages main paper and 8 pages references and appendix</p></details> |

This work presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L) evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on 48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5 gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the original Otsu method.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 tables |

While existing methods address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input, feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

While smaller VLMs are cheaper to run, they typically produce responses only marginally better than random guessing on benchmarks such as MMMU. In this paper, we propose Cache of Thought (CoT), a master apprentice framework for collaborative inference between large and small VLMs. CoT manages high quality query results from large VLMs (master) in a cache, which are then selected via a novel multi modal retrieval and in-context learning to aid the performance of small VLMs (apprentice). We extensively evaluate CoT on various widely recognized and challenging general reasoning benchmarks, and show that CoT increases overall reasoning performance by up to 7.7% under the same budget, and specifically boosts the performance of apprentice VLMs by up to 36.6%.

These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Efficient Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis for expensive and non-differentiable physics-based simulations in high stochastic dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24708v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional Bayesian inverse analysis (dim >> 100) is mostly unfeasible for computationally demanding, nonlinear physics-based high-fidelity (HF) models. Usually, the use of more efficient gradient-based inference schemes is impeded if the multi-physics models are provided by complex legacy codes. Adjoint-based derivatives are either exceedingly cumbersome to derive or non-existent for practically relevant large-scale nonlinear and coupled multi-physics problems. Similarly, holistic automated differentiation w.r.t. primary variables of multi-physics codes is usually not yet an option and requires extensive code restructuring if not considered from the outset in the software design. This absence of differentiability further exacerbates the already present computational challenges. To overcome the existing limitations, we propose a novel inference approach called Bayesian multi-fidelity inverse analysis (BMFIA), which leverages simpler and computationally cheaper lower-fidelity (LF) models that are designed to provide model derivatives. BMFIA learns a simple, probabilistic dependence of the LF and HF models, which is then employed in an altered likelihood formulation to statistically correct the inaccurate LF response. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this dependence represents a multi-fidelity conditional density (discriminative model). We demonstrate how this multi-fidelity conditional density can be learned robustly in the small data regime from only a few HF and LF simulations (50 to 300), which would not be sufficient for naive surrogate approaches. The formulation is fully differentiable and allows the flexible design of a wide range of LF models.</p></details> | 40 pages, 20 figures |

Such models are often approximations and introduce systematic errors leading to a bias of the posterior distribution in Bayesian inversion. We propose a unified framework that combines transport maps from a reference distribution to the posterior distribution with the model error approach. This leads to an adaptive algorithm that jointly estimates the posterior distribution of the measurand and the model error. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated on two model problems, showing that the approach effectively corrects biases while enabling fast sampling.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Practical quantum advantage can be said to exist for such problems when the end-to-end time for solving such a problem using a classical algorithm exceeds that required by a quantum algorithm. Reducing the power flow (PF) problem into a linear system of equations allows for the formulation of quantum PF (QPF) algorithms, which are based on solving methods for quantum linear systems such as the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm. Speedup from using QPF algorithms is often claimed to be exponential when compared to classical PF solved by state-of-the-art algorithms. We investigate the potential for practical quantum advantage in solving QPF compared to classical methods on gate-based quantum computers. Notably, this paper does not present a new QPF solving algorithm but scrutinizes the end-to-end complexity of the QPF approach, providing a nuanced evaluation of the purported quantum speedup in this problem. Our analysis establishes a best-case bound for the HHL-based quantum power flow complexity, conclusively demonstrating that the HHL-based method has higher runtime complexity compared to the classical algorithm for solving the direct current power flow (DCPF) and fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) problem. Notably, our analysis and conclusions can be extended to any quantum linear system solver with rigorous performance guarantees, based on the known complexity lower bounds for this problem. Additionally, we establish that for potential practical quantum advantage (PQA) to exist it is necessary to consider DCPF-type problems with a very narrow range of condition number values and readout requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Only ...</summary><p>Only change of the paper title due to you know who</p></details> |

We evaluate the ability of Persistence Images (PIs) to infer parameters, comparing them to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS). We also compare two classes of models: neural-based and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS for parameters that can be constrained, i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$. PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, highlighting the potential of persistent homology for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results indicate that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little additional or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ is additionally informed by filaments (1-cycles).</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables.

Agents with different models match in pairs to play a stage game, where models define feasible beliefs about game parameters and about others' strategies. In equilibrium, each agent adopts the feasible belief that best fits their data and plays optimally given their beliefs. We define the stability of the resident model by comparing its equilibrium payoff with that of the entrant model, and provide conditions under which the correctly specified resident model can only be destabilized by misspecified entrant models that contain multiple feasible beliefs (that is, entrant models that permit inference). We also show that entrants may do well in their matches against the residents only when the entrant population is large, due to the endogeneity of misspecified beliefs. Applications include the selection of demand-elasticity misperception in Cournot duopoly and the emergence of analogy-based reasoning in centipede games.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This material was previously part of a larger paper titled "Evolutionarily Stable (Mis)specifications: Theory and Applications," which split into two smaller papers: "Misspecified Learning and Evolutionary Stability" and "Higher-Order Beliefs and (Mis)learning from Prices.". arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.15007</p></details> |
| **[Transient regime of piecewise deterministic Monte Carlo algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16062v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) such as the Bouncy Particle Sampler and the Zig-Zag Sampler, have gained attention as continuous-time counterparts of classical Markov chain Monte Carlo. We study their transient regime under convex potentials, namely how trajectories that start in low-probability regions move toward higher-probability sets. Using fluid-limit arguments with a decomposition of the generator into fast and slow parts, we obtain deterministic ordinary differential equation descriptions of early-stage behaviour. The fast dynamics alone are non-ergodic because once the event rate reaches zero it does not restart. The slow component reactivates the dynamics, so averaging remains valid when taken over short micro-cycles rather than with respect to an invariant law. Using the expected number of jump events as a cost proxy for gradient evaluations, we find that for Gaussian targets the transient cost of PDMP methods is comparable to that of random-walk Metropolis. For convex heavy-tailed families with subquadratic growth, PDMP methods can be more efficient when event simulation is implemented well. Forward Event-Chain and Coordinate Samplers can, under the same assumptions, reach the typical set with an order-one expected number of jumps. For the Zig-Zag Sampler we show that, under a diagonal-dominance condition, the transient choice of direction coincides with the solution of a box-constrained quadratic program; outside that regime we give a formal derivation and a piecewise-smooth update rule that clarifies the roles of the gradient and the Hessian. These results provide theoretical insight and practical guidance for the use of PDMP samplers in large-scale inference.</p></details> | 39 pages, 6 figures |

These errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL) and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions. First, we study how each methods performance scales with the number of expert annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in finite samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as: Nicolas Audinet de Pieuchon, Adel Daoud, Connor T.

| **[Learning Safety for Obstacle Avoidance via Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16037v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obstacle avoidance is central to safe navigation, especially for robots with arbitrary and nonconvex geometries operating in cluttered environments. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) approaches often rely on analytic clearance computations, which are infeasible for complex geometries, or on polytopic approximations, which become intractable when robot configurations are unknown. To address these limitations, this paper trains a residual neural network on a large dataset of robot-obstacle configurations to enable fast and tractable clearance prediction, even at unseen configurations. The predicted clearance defines the radius of a Local Safety Ball (LSB), which ensures continuous-time collision-free navigation. The LSB boundary is encoded as a Discrete-Time High-Order CBF (DHOCBF), whose constraints are incorporated into a nonlinear optimization framework. To improve feasibility, a novel relaxation technique is applied. The resulting framework ensure that the robot's rigid-body motion between consecutive time steps remains collision-free, effectively bridging discrete-time control and continuous-time safety. We show that the proposed method handles arbitrary, including nonconvex, robot geometries and generates collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories in cluttered environments. Experiments demonstrate millisecond-level solve times and high prediction accuracy, highlighting both safety and efficiency beyond existing CBF-based methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

A counterfactual lens on transport maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16027v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coupling probability measures lies at the core of many problems in statistics and machine learning, from domain adaptation to transfer learning and causal inference. Yet, even when restricted to deterministic transports, such couplings are not identifiable: two atomless marginals admit infinitely many transport maps. The common recourse to optimal transport, motivated by cost minimization and cyclical monotonicity, obscures the fact that several distinct notions of multivariate monotone matchings coexist. In this work, we first carry a comparative analysis of three constructions of transport maps: cyclically monotone, quantile-preserving and triangular monotone maps. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for their equivalence, thereby clarifying their respective structural properties. In parallel, we formulate counterfactual reasoning within the framework of structural causal models as a problem of selecting transport maps between fixed marginals, which makes explicit the role of untestable assumptions in counterfactual reasoning. Then, we are able to connect these two perspectives by identifying conditions on causal graphs and structural equations under which counterfactual maps coincide with classical statistical transports. In this way, we delineate the circumstances in which causal assumptions support the use of a specific structure of transport map. Taken together, our results aim to enrich the theoretical understanding of families of transport maps and to clarify their possible causal interpretations. We hope this work contributes to establishing new bridges between statistical transport and causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages; comments most welcome</p></details> |

Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley graphs constructed over $SL(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation (SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology. SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space, improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures, offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been updated and now utilizes a more comprehensive methodology, we felt that the name does not do justice to it as their is no graph rewiring involved.

To overcome the lack of such a dataset, recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven digital characters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM TOG 2025 (SIGGRAPH journal track); Project page: https://electronicarts.github.io/tiny-voice2face/</p></details> |

We introduce Right-Side-Out, a zero-shot sim-to-real framework that effectively solves this challenge by exploiting task structures. We decompose the task into Drag/Fling to create and stabilize an access opening, followed by Insert&Pull to invert the garment. Each step uses a depth-inferred, keypoint-parameterized bimanual primitive that sharply reduces the action space while preserving robustness. Efficient data generation is enabled by our custom-built, high-fidelity, GPU-parallel Material Point Method (MPM) simulator that models thin-shell deformation and provides robust and efficient contact handling for batched rollouts. Built on the simulator, our fully automated pipeline scales data generation by randomizing garment geometry, material parameters, and viewpoints, producing depth, masks, and per-primitive keypoint labels without any human annotations. With a single depth camera, policies trained entirely in simulation deploy zero-shot on real hardware, achieving up to 81.3% success rate. By employing task decomposition and high fidelity simulation, our framework enables tackling highly dynamic, severely occluded tasks without laborious human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>More ...</summary><p>More details and supplementary material are on the website: https://right-side-out.github.io</p></details> |
| **[PAC Apprenticeship Learning with Bayesian Active Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03693v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their decision-making with human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy -- providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces, we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at RLC 2025; published in RLJ 2025</p></details> |
| **[FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01064v5)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

We introduce K-Steering, a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of EMNLP, 2025</p></details> |

To mitigate these risks and to comply with privacy regulations, Federated Unlearning (FU) has been introduced to enable participants in FL systems to remove their data's influence from the global model. However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to efficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks. We argue that effective unlearning necessitates a paradigm shift: designing FL systems inherently amenable to forgetting. To this end, we propose a learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information, directly simplifying subsequent unlearning. Crucially, ToFU can work as a plug-and-play framework that improves the performance of existing FU methods. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the MUFAC benchmark show that ToFU outperforms existing FU baselines, enhances performance when integrated with current methods, and reduces unlearning time.</p></details> | ECAI-2025 |

However, deploying these models on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi poses challenges related to computational efficiency and thermal management. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for audio tagging on the Raspberry Pi is conducted, encompassing all 1D and 2D models from the Pretrained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) framework, a ConvNeXt-based model adapted for audio classification, as well as MobileNetV3 architectures. In addition, two PANNs-derived networks, CNN9 and CNN13, recently proposed, are also evaluated. To enhance deployment efficiency and portability across diverse hardware platforms, all models are converted to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. Unlike previous works that focus on a single model, our analysis encompasses a broader range of architectures and involves continuous 24-hour inference sessions to assess performance stability. Our experiments reveal that, with appropriate model selection and optimization, it is possible to maintain consistent inference latency and manage thermal behavior effectively over extended periods. These findings provide valuable insights for deploying audio tagging models in real-world edge computing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Computing Conference 2026, London, UK</p></details> |
| **[From Judgment to Interference: Early Stopping LLM Harmful Outputs via Streaming Content Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09996v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models (LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |

While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DAGM GCPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Automating Versatile Time-Series Analysis with Tiny Transformers on Embedded FPGAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17662v5)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have shown strong performance across diverse time-series tasks, but their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to high memory and computational demand. While prior work targeting Microcontroller Units (MCUs) has explored hardware-specific optimizations, such approaches are often task-specific and limited to 8-bit fixed-point precision. Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer greater flexibility, enabling fine-grained control over data precision and architecture. However, existing FPGA-based deployments of Transformers for time-series analysis typically focus on high-density platforms with manual configuration. This paper presents a unified and fully automated deployment framework for Tiny Transformers on embedded FPGAs. Our framework supports a compact encoder-only Transformer architecture across three representative time-series tasks (forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection). It combines quantization-aware training (down to 4 bits), hardware-aware hyperparameter search using Optuna, and automatic VHDL generation for seamless deployment. We evaluate our framework on six public datasets across two embedded FPGA platforms. Results show that our framework produces integer-only, task-specific Transformer accelerators achieving as low as 0.033 mJ per inference with millisecond latency on AMD Spartan-7, while also providing insights into deployment feasibility on Lattice iCE40. All source code will be released in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Edwina1030/TinyTransformer4TS).</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted by IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI 2025)</p></details> |

We propose CIDER, a novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score (BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the development of trustworthy generative AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ICASSP2026</p></details> |

While various compression strategies have been explored, sequence-level compression, which drops the full KV caches for certain tokens, is particularly challenging as it can lead to the loss of important contextual information. To address this, we introduce UniGist, a sequence-level long-context compression framework that efficiently preserves context information by replacing raw tokens with special compression tokens (gists) in a fine-grained manner. We adopt a chunk-free training strategy and design an efficient kernel with a gist shift trick, enabling optimized GPU training. Our scheme also supports flexible inference by allowing the actual removal of compressed tokens, resulting in real-time memory savings. Experiments across multiple long-context tasks demonstrate that UniGist significantly improves compression quality, with especially strong performance in detail-recalling tasks and long-range dependency modeling.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Although there are exact algorithms for inference and learning for certain LVMs such as linear Gaussian models and mixture models, researchers must typically develop approximate inference and learning algorithms when applying novel LVMs. Here we study the line that separates LVMs that rely on approximation schemes from those that do not, and develop a general theory of exponential family LVMs for which inference and learning may be implemented exactly. Firstly, under mild assumptions about the exponential family form of the LVM, we derive a necessary and sufficient constraint on the parameters of the LVM under which the prior and posterior over the latent variables are in the same exponential family. We then show that a variety of well-known and novel models indeed have this constrained, exponential family form. Finally, we derive generalized inference and learning algorithms for these LVMs, and demonstrate them with a variety of examples. Our unified perspective facilitates both understanding and implementing exact inference and learning algorithms for a wide variety of models, and may guide researchers in the discovery of new models that avoid unnecessary approximations.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In press at Statistical Science</p></details> |
| **[Incremental Multistep Forecasting of Battery Degradation Using Pseudo Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15740v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven models accurately perform early battery prognosis to prevent equipment failure and further safety hazards. Most existing machine learning (ML) models work in offline mode which must consider their retraining post-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there is a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying distributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a great challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the current instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of time to acquire enough streaming data before retraining. In this study, we propose iFSNet (incremental Fast and Slow learning Network) which is a modified version of FSNet for a single-pass mode (sample-by-sample) to achieve multistep forecasting using pseudo targets. It uses a simple linear regressor of the input sequence to extrapolate pseudo future samples (pseudo targets) and calculate the loss from the rest of the forecast and keep updating the model. The model benefits from the associative memory and adaptive structure mechanisms of FSNet, at the same time the model incrementally improves by using pseudo targets. The proposed model achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on datasets with smooth degradation trajectories while it achieved 0.01588 RMSE and 0.01234 MAE on datasets having irregular degradation trajectories with capacity regeneration spikes.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The published version of this preprint can be accessed at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10874675</p></details> |

We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size. Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption. These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Imagination at Inference: Synthesizing In-Hand Views for Robust Visuomotor Policy Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15717v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual observations from different viewpoints can significantly influence the performance of visuomotor policies in robotic manipulation. Among these, egocentric (in-hand) views often provide crucial information for precise control. However, in some applications, equipping robots with dedicated in-hand cameras may pose challenges due to hardware constraints, system complexity, and cost. In this work, we propose to endow robots with imaginative perception - enabling them to 'imagine' in-hand observations from agent views at inference time. We achieve this via novel view synthesis (NVS), leveraging a fine-tuned diffusion model conditioned on the relative pose between the agent and in-hand views cameras. Specifically, we apply LoRA-based fine-tuning to adapt a pretrained NVS model (ZeroNVS) to the robotic manipulation domain. We evaluate our approach on both simulation benchmarks (RoboMimic and MimicGen) and real-world experiments using a Unitree Z1 robotic arm for a strawberry picking task. Results show that synthesized in-hand views significantly enhance policy inference, effectively recovering the performance drop caused by the absence of real in-hand cameras. Our method offers a scalable and hardware-light solution for deploying robust visuomotor policies, highlighting the potential of imaginative visual reasoning in embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication, under review</p></details> |

More recently, a useful Muon optimizer is specifically designed for matrix-structured parameters of large models. Although some works have begun to studying Muon optimizer, the existing Muon and its variants still suffer from high sample complexity or high memory for large models. To fill this gap, we propose a light and fast Muon (LiMuon) optimizer for training large models, which builds on the momentum-based variance reduced technique and randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our LiMuon optimizer has a lower memory than the current Muon and its variants. Moreover, we prove that our LiMuon has a lower sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of non-convex stochastic optimization under the smooth condition. Recently, the existing convergence analysis of Muon optimizer mainly relies on the strict Lipschitz smooth assumption, while some artificial intelligence tasks such as training large language models (LLMs) do not satisfy this condition. We also proved that our LiMuon optimizer has a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ under the generalized smooth condition. Numerical experimental results on training DistilGPT2 and ViT models verify efficiency of our LiMuon optimizer.</p></details> | 28 pages |
| **[A Steered Response Power Method for Sound Source Localization With Generic Acoustic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15702v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steered response power (SRP) method is one of the most popular approaches for acoustic source localization with microphone arrays. It is often based on simplifying acoustic assumptions, such as an omnidirectional sound source in the far field of the microphone array(s), free field propagation, and spatially uncorrelated noise. In reality, however, there are many acoustic scenarios where such assumptions are violated. This paper proposes a generalization of the conventional SRP method that allows to apply generic acoustic models for localization with arbitrary microphone constellations. These models may consider, for instance, level differences in distributed microphones, the directivity of sources and receivers, or acoustic shadowing effects. Moreover, also measured acoustic transfer functions may be applied as acoustic model. We show that the delay-and-sum beamforming of the conventional SRP is not optimal for localization with generic acoustic models. To this end, we propose a generalized SRP beamforming criterion that considers generic acoustic models and spatially correlated noise, and derive an optimal SRP beamformer. Furthermore, we propose and analyze appropriate frequency weightings. Unlike the conventional SRP, the proposed method can jointly exploit observed level and time differences between the microphone signals to infer the source location. Realistic simulations of three different microphone setups with speech under various noise conditions indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the mean localization error compared to the conventional SRP and, in particular, a reduction of more than 60% can be archived in noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |

As this method gains popularity, ensuring the security of online voting systems becomes increasingly vital, as the systems supporting it must satisfy a demanding set of security requirements. Most research in this area emphasizes the design and verification of cryptographic protocols to protect voter integrity and system confidentiality. However, other vectors, such as network traffic analysis, remain relatively understudied, even though they may pose significant threats to voter privacy and the overall trustworthiness of the system. In this paper, we examine how adversaries can exploit metadata from encrypted network traffic to uncover sensitive information during online voting. Our analysis reveals that, even without accessing the encrypted content, it is possible to infer critical voter actions, such as whether a person votes, the exact moment a ballot is submitted, and whether the ballot is valid or spoiled. We test these attacks with both rule-based techniques and machine learning methods. We evaluate our attacks on two widely used online voting platforms, one proprietary and one partially open source, achieving classification accuracy as high as 99.5%. These results expose a significant privacy vulnerability that threatens key properties of secure elections, including voter secrecy and protection against coercion or vote-buying. We explore mitigations to our attacks, demonstrating that countermeasures such as payload padding and timestamp equalization can substantially limit their effectiveness.</p></details> | Accepted at ISC 2025 |

Prompt-based methods incorporate user preferences into queries, while training-based methods encode them into model parameters. Model merging has also been explored for personalization under limited data. However, existing methods often fail to directly optimize task-specific utility and lack explicit mechanisms for privacy preservation. To address the limitations, we propose Privacy-Preserving Model Merging via Evolutionary Algorithms (PriME), a novel personalization approach that employs gradient-free methods to directly optimize utility while reducing privacy risks. By integrating privacy preservation into the optimization objective, PriME creates personalized modules that effectively capture target user preferences while minimizing privacy risks for data-sharing users. Experiments on the LaMP benchmark show that PriME consistently outperforms a range of baselines, achieving up to a 45% improvement in task performance. Further analysis demonstrates that PriME achieves a superior privacy-utility trade-off compared to a prior state-of-the-art, with enhanced robustness to membership inference attacks and greater utility in capturing user preferences.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Oral |
| **[Large Language Model Powered Symbolic Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13452v2)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional static program analysis methods, such as symbolic execution, offering the ability to reason over code directly without relying on theorem provers or SMT solvers. However, LLMs are also inherently approximate by nature, and therefore face significant challenges in relation to the accuracy and scale of analysis in real-world applications. Such issues often necessitate the use of larger LLMs with higher token limits, but this requires enterprise-grade hardware (GPUs) and thus limits accessibility for many users. In this paper, we propose LLM-based symbolic execution -- a novel approach that enhances LLM inference via a path-based decomposition of the program analysis tasks into smaller (more tractable) subtasks. The core idea is to generalize path constraints using a generic code-based representation that the LLM can directly reason over, and without translation into another (less-expressive) formal language. We implement our approach in the form of AutoBug, an LLM-based symbolic execution engine that is lightweight and language-agnostic, making it a practical tool for analyzing code that is challenging for traditional approaches. We show that AutoBug can improve both the accuracy and scale of LLM-based program analysis, especially for smaller LLMs that can run on consumer-grade hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables, published in "Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications" (OOPSLA), 2025</p></details> |

The data format, named cognitive-logs, enables rigour and flexible logical reasoning. Cognitive-logs consist of a set of relational and graph databases. Cognitive-logs store an episodic memory as a graphical network that consist of "actions" represented by verbs in natural languages and "participants" who perform the actions. These objects are connected by arrows (morphisms) that bind each action to its participant and bind causes and effects. The design principle of cognitive-logs refers cognitive sciences especially in cognitive linguistics. Logical reasoning is the processes of comparing causal chains in episodic memories with known rules which are also recorded in the cognitive-logs. Operations based on category theory enable such comparisons between episodic memories or scenarios. These operations represent various inferences including planning, comprehensions, and hierarchical abstractions of stories. The goal of this study is to develop a database-driven artificial intelligence that thinks like a human but possesses the accuracy and rigour of a machine. The vast capacities of databases (up to petabyte scales in current technologies) enable the artificial intelligence to store a greater volume of knowledge than neural-network based artificial intelligences. Cognitive-logs also serve as a model of human cognition mind activities.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

| **[GoT: Unleashing Reasoning Capability of Multimodal Large Language Model for Visual Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10639v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current image generation and editing methods primarily process textual prompts as direct inputs without reasoning about visual composition and explicit operations. We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and models are released in https://github.com/rongyaofang/GoT</p></details> |
| **[Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10637v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

| **[V2Edit: Versatile Video Diffusion Editor for Videos and 3D Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10634v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces V$^2$Edit, a novel training-free framework for instruction-guided video and 3D scene editing. Addressing the critical challenge of balancing original content preservation with editing task fulfillment, our approach employs a progressive strategy that decomposes complex editing tasks into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Each subtask is controlled through three key synergistic mechanisms: the initial noise, noise added at each denoising step, and cross-attention maps between text prompts and video content. This ensures robust preservation of original video elements while effectively applying the desired edits. Beyond its native video editing capability, we extend V$^2$Edit to 3D scene editing via a "render-edit-reconstruct" process, enabling high-quality, 3D-consistent edits even for tasks involving substantial geometric changes such as object insertion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our V$^2$Edit achieves high-quality and successful edits across various challenging video editing tasks and complex 3D scene editing tasks, thereby establishing state-of-the-art performance in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://immortalco.github.io/V2Edit/</p></details> |
| **[A Frustratingly Simple Yet Highly Effective Attack Baseline: Over 90% Success Rate Against the Strong Black-box Models of GPT-4.5/4o/o1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10635v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite promising performance on open-source large vision-language models (LVLMs), transfer-based targeted attacks often fail against black-box commercial LVLMs. Analyzing failed adversarial perturbations reveals that the learned perturbations typically originate from a uniform distribution and lack clear semantic details, resulting in unintended responses. This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods. Our optimized adversarial examples under different configurations and training code are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/M-Attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at: https://github.com/VILA-Lab/M-Attack</p></details> |
| **[UniGoal: Towards Universal Zero-shot Goal-oriented Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10630v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[SciVerse: Unveiling the Knowledge Comprehension and Visual Reasoning of LMMs on Multi-modal Scientific Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10627v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled their application in scientific problem-solving, yet their fine-grained capabilities remain under-explored. In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

| **[LHM: Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model from a Single Image in Seconds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10625v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animatable 3D human reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity in decoupling geometry, appearance, and deformation. Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lingtengqiu.github.io/LHM/</p></details> |
| **[ETCH: Generalizing Body Fitting to Clothed Humans via Equivariant Tightness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10624v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings. Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics. We will release the code and models soon for research purposes at https://boqian-li.github.io/ETCH/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://boqian-li.github.io/ETCH/, Code: https://github.com/boqian-li/ETCH</p></details> |
| **[Transformers without Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normalization layers are ubiquitous in modern neural networks and have long been considered essential. This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project page: https://jiachenzhu.github.io/DyT/</p></details> |
| **[DriveLMM-o1: A Step-by-Step Reasoning Dataset and Large Multimodal Model for Driving Scenario Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10621v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, certain challenges require complex multi-step reasoning to reach accurate answers. One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model. Our framework, dataset, and model are available at https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, github: https://github.com/ayesha-ishaq/DriveLMM-o1</p></details> |
| **[Siege: Autonomous Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models with Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10619v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Siege, a multi-turn adversarial framework that models the gradual erosion of Large Language Model (LLM) safety through a tree search perspective. Unlike single-turn jailbreaks that rely on one meticulously engineered prompt, Siege expands the conversation at each turn in a breadth-first fashion, branching out multiple adversarial prompts that exploit partial compliance from previous responses. By tracking these incremental policy leaks and re-injecting them into subsequent queries, Siege reveals how minor concessions can accumulate into fully disallowed outputs. Evaluations on the JailbreakBench dataset show that Siege achieves a 100% success rate on GPT-3.5-turbo and 97% on GPT-4 in a single multi-turn run, using fewer queries than baselines such as Crescendo or GOAT. This tree search methodology offers an in-depth view of how model safeguards degrade over successive dialogue turns, underscoring the urgency of robust multi-turn testing procedures for language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 Trustworthy LLM</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning for Adaptive Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10617v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large language models to multiple tasks can cause cross-skill interference, where improvements for one skill degrade another. While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 SCOPE</p></details> |
| **[OVTR: End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10616v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary multiple object tracking aims to generalize trackers to unseen categories during training, enabling their application across a variety of real-world scenarios. However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability.

| **[R1-Onevision: Advancing Generalized Multimodal Reasoning through Cross-Modal Formalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10615v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability in complex textual tasks. However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond. Experimental results show that R1-Onevision achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming models such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL on multiple challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Model: https://github.com/Fancy-MLLM/R1-onevision</p></details> |

Ensuring robustness in these safety-critical systems is essential, particularly when vehicles must navigate adverse weather conditions and sensor corruptions that may not have been encountered during training. Current methods often overlook uncertainties arising from adversarial conditions or distributional shifts, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose an efficient adaptation of an uncertainty estimation technique for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method dynamically calibrates model confidence using epistemic uncertainty estimates. Our evaluation under various camera corruption scenarios, such as fog or missing cameras, demonstrates that our approach effectively quantifies epistemic uncertainty by assigning higher uncertainty values to unseen data. We introduce region-specific corruptions to simulate defects affecting only a single camera and validate our findings through both scene-level and region-level assessments. Our results show superior performance in Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection and confidence calibration compared to common baselines such as Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout. Our approach consistently demonstrates reliable uncertainty measures, indicating its potential for enhancing the robustness of autonomous driving systems in real-world scenarios.

However, recent studies have shown that CoT reasoning is not always faithful, i.e. CoT reasoning does not always reflect how models arrive at conclusions. So far, most of these studies have focused on unfaithfulness in unnatural contexts where an explicit bias has been introduced. In contrast, we show that unfaithful CoT can occur on realistic prompts with no artificial bias. Our results reveal non-negligible rates of several forms of unfaithful reasoning in frontier models: Sonnet 3.7 (16.3%), DeepSeek R1 (5.3%) and ChatGPT-4o (7.0%) all answer a notable proportion of question pairs unfaithfully. Specifically, we find that models rationalize their implicit biases in answers to binary questions ("implicit post-hoc rationalization"). For example, when separately presented with the questions "Is X bigger than Y?" and "Is Y bigger than X?", models sometimes produce superficially coherent arguments to justify answering Yes to both questions or No to both questions, despite such responses being logically contradictory. We also investigate restoration errors (Dziri et al., 2023), where models make and then silently correct errors in their reasoning, and unfaithful shortcuts, where models use clearly illogical reasoning to simplify solving problems in Putnam questions (a hard benchmark). Our findings raise challenges for AI safety work that relies on monitoring CoT to detect undesired behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Models Workshop (ICLR 25), 10 main paper pages, 38 appendix pages</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Existing hair capture methods struggle to balance photorealistic rendering with relighting capabilities. Analytical material models, while physically grounded, often fail to fully capture appearance details. Conversely, neural rendering approaches excel at view synthesis but generalize poorly to novel lighting conditions. GroomLight addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of both paradigms. It employs an extended hair BSDF model to capture primary light transport and a light-aware residual model to reconstruct the remaining details. We further propose a hybrid inverse rendering pipeline to optimize both components, enabling high-fidelity relighting, view synthesis, and material editing.

Previous camera-conditioned video generative models suffer from diminished video dynamics and limited range of viewpoints when generating videos with large camera movement. We take an approach that progressively expands the generation of dynamic scenes -- first enhancing dynamic content within individual video clip, then extending this capability to create seamless explorations across broad viewpoint ranges. Specifically, we construct a dataset featuring a large degree of dynamics with camera parameter annotations for training while designing a lightweight camera injection module and training scheme to preserve dynamics of the pretrained models. Building on these improved single-clip techniques, we enable extended scene exploration by allowing users to iteratively specify camera trajectories for generating coherent video sequences. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that CameraCtrl Ii enables camera-controlled dynamic scene synthesis with substantially wider spatial exploration than previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://hehao13.github.io/Projects-CameraCtrl-II/</p></details> |

However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

| **[The Spectral Bias of Shallow Neural Network Learning is Shaped by the Choice of Non-linearity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10587v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite classical statistical theory predicting severe overfitting, modern massively overparameterized neural networks still generalize well. This unexpected property is attributed to the network's so-called implicit bias, which describes its propensity to converge to solutions that generalize effectively, among the many possible that correctly label the training data. The aim of our research is to explore this bias from a new perspective, focusing on how non-linear activation functions contribute to shaping it. First, we introduce a reparameterization which removes a continuous weight rescaling symmetry. Second, in the kernel regime, we leverage this reparameterization to generalize recent findings that relate shallow Neural Networks to the Radon transform, deriving an explicit formula for the implicit bias induced by a broad class of activation functions. Specifically, by utilizing the connection between the Radon transform and the Fourier transform, we interpret the kernel regime's inductive bias as minimizing a spectral seminorm that penalizes high-frequency components, in a manner dependent on the activation function. Finally, in the adaptive regime, we demonstrate the existence of local dynamical attractors that facilitate the formation of clusters of hyperplanes where the input to a neuron's activation function is zero, yielding alignment between many neurons' response functions. We confirm these theoretical results with simulations. All together, our work provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the generalization capabilities of overparameterized neural networks and its relation with the implicit bias, offering potential pathways for designing more efficient and robust models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures in main text</p></details> |
| **[Unlock the Power of Unlabeled Data in Language Driving Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10586v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-based Large Language Models~(VisionLLMs) for autonomous driving have seen rapid advancements. However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |

In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[DataEnvGym: Data Generation Agents in Teacher Environments with Student Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06215v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of creating training data to teach models is currently driven by humans, who manually analyze model weaknesses and plan how to create data that improves a student model. Approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or teachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid, scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into data), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal is to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and evaluated on generated data, and their feedback (in the form of errors or weak skills) is reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes multiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the state representation and action space. More structured environments are based on inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We support 4 domains (math, code, VQA, and tool-use) and test multiple students and teachers. Example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively improve students across tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments teach different skill levels and test variants of key modules, pointing to future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight; Project Page: https://DataEnvGym.github.io</p></details> |

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |

We characterize entropic and distributional properties such as their entropy and relative entropy rates, finite-state compressibility and log loss of their realizations, and the empirical distributions that they induce. Though not quite stationary, these sources are "almost stationary and ergodic;" similar to stationary and ergodic processes, they satisfy a Shannon-McMillan-Breiman-type property: the normalized log probability of their realizations converges almost surely to their entropy rate. Further, they are locally "almost i.i.d." in the sense that the finite-dimensional empirical distributions of their realizations converge almost surely to a deterministic i.i.d. law. However, unlike stationary ergodic sources, the finite-state compressibility of their realizations is almost surely strictly larger than their entropy rate by a "Jensen gap." We present simulations demonstrating the theoretical results. Among their potential uses, these sources allow to gauge the performance of sequential probability models on non-Markovian non-stationary data.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

Though forming the foundation of Transformer models, the dot-product attention does not scale well to long-context data since its time requirement grows quadratically with context length. In this work, we propose Radar, a training-free approach that accelerates inference by dynamically searching for the most important context tokens. For any pre-trained Transformer, Radar can reduce the decoding time complexity without training or heuristically evicting tokens. Moreover, we provide theoretical justification for our approach, demonstrating that Radar can reliably identify the most important tokens with high probability. We conduct extensive comparisons with the previous methods on a wide range of tasks. The results demonstrate that Radar achieves the state-of-the-art performance across different architectures with reduced time complexity, offering a practical solution for efficient long-context processing of Transformers.</p></details> | Accepted @ ICLR 2025 |
| **[FedPCA: Noise-Robust Fair Federated Learning via Performance-Capacity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10567v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a model that effectively handles both common and rare data-i.e., achieving performance fairness-is crucial in federated learning (FL). While existing fair FL methods have shown effectiveness, they remain vulnerable to mislabeled data. Ensuring robustness in fair FL is therefore essential. However, fairness and robustness inherently compete, which causes robust strategies to hinder fairness. In this paper, we attribute this competition to the homogeneity in loss patterns exhibited by rare and mislabeled data clients, preventing existing loss-based fair and robust FL methods from effectively distinguishing and handling these two distinct client types. To address this, we propose performance-capacity analysis, which jointly considers model performance on each client and its capacity to handle the dataset, measured by loss and a newly introduced feature dispersion score. This allows mislabeled clients to be identified by their significantly deviated performance relative to capacity while preserving rare data clients. Building on this, we introduce FedPCA, an FL method that robustly achieves fairness. FedPCA first identifies mislabeled clients via a Gaussian Mixture Model on loss-dispersion pairs, then applies fairness and robustness strategies in global aggregation and local training by adjusting client weights and selectively using reliable data. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate FedPCA's effectiveness in tackling this complex challenge. Code will be publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | Preprint |

In particular, previous work has identified the absence of an intrinsic separation between instructions and data as a root cause for the success of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose an architectural change, ASIDE, that allows the model to clearly separate between instructions and data by using separate embeddings for them. Instead of training the embeddings from scratch, we propose a method to convert an existing model to ASIDE form by using two copies of the original model's embeddings layer, and applying an orthogonal rotation to one of them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing (1) highly increased instruction-data separation scores without a loss in model capabilities and (2) competitive results on prompt injection benchmarks, even without dedicated safety training. Additionally, we study the working mechanism behind our method through an analysis of model representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Workshop on Building Trust in Language Models and Applications</p></details> |

The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos. Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling. However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns. In this work, we introduce BIMBA, an efficient state-space model to handle long-form videos. Our model leverages the selective scan algorithm to learn to effectively select critical information from high-dimensional video and transform it into a reduced token sequence for efficient LLM processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIMBA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple long-form VQA benchmarks, including PerceptionTest, NExT-QA, EgoSchema, VNBench, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME.

| **[The Lagrangian Method for Solving Constrained Markov Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10561v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the concept of a Lagrangian game to solve constrained Markov games. Such games model scenarios where agents face cost constraints in addition to their individual rewards, that depend on both agent joint actions and the evolving environment state over time. Constrained Markov games form the formal mechanism behind safe multiagent reinforcement learning, providing a structured model for dynamic multiagent interactions in a multitude of settings, such as autonomous teams operating under local energy and time constraints, for example. We develop a primal-dual approach in which agents solve a Lagrangian game associated with the current Lagrange multiplier, simulate cost and reward trajectories over a fixed horizon, and update the multiplier using accrued experience. This update rule generates a new Lagrangian game, initiating the next iteration. Our key result consists in showing that the sequence of solutions to these Lagrangian games yields a nonstationary Nash solution for the original constrained Markov game.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Learning Interpretable Logic Rules from Deep Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10547v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general framework called VisionLogic to extract interpretable logic rules from deep vision models, with a focus on image classification tasks. Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360$^\circ$ synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please visit our website for more information and the code: https://madaror.github.io/tiled-diffusion.github.io/</p></details> |

However, many existing approaches overlook the importance of object dynamics, limiting their applicability to more complex, dynamic tasks. In this work, we introduce KUDA, an open-vocabulary manipulation system that integrates dynamics learning and visual prompting through keypoints, leveraging both VLMs and learning-based neural dynamics models. Our key insight is that a keypoint-based target specification is simultaneously interpretable by VLMs and can be efficiently translated into cost functions for model-based planning. Given language instructions and visual observations, KUDA first assigns keypoints to the RGB image and queries the VLM to generate target specifications. These abstract keypoint-based representations are then converted into cost functions, which are optimized using a learned dynamics model to produce robotic trajectories. We evaluate KUDA on a range of manipulation tasks, including free-form language instructions across diverse object categories, multi-object interactions, and deformable or granular objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

The graph, $G$, is star-shaped with $D$ arms radiating from a start node, $s$. A language model (LM) is given $G$, $s$, and a target node $t$, which ends one of the arms and is tasked with generating the arm containing $t$. The minimal nature of this task means only a single choice needs to be made: which of the $D$ arms contains $t$? Decoder-only LMs fail to solve this elementary task above $1/D$ chance due to a learned shortcut that absorbs training supervision. We show how this pathology is caused by excess supervision and we present a series of solutions demonstrating that the task is solvable via decoder-only LMs. We find that the task's minimal nature causes its difficulty, as it prevents task decomposition. Our solutions provide insight into the pathology and its implications for LMs trained via next-token prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>A red...</summary><p>A reduced version of this work has been accepted to the Workshop on Spurious Correlation and Shortcut Learning: Foundations and Solutions (SCSL) at ICLR 2025.

However, their potential remains untapped, primarily due to the limited quantity and suboptimal quality of 3D datasets. Current approaches attempt to transfer knowledge from 2D MLLMs to expand 3D instruction data, but still face modality and domain gaps. To this end, we introduce PiSA-Engine (Point-Self-Augmented-Engine), a new framework for generating instruction point-language datasets enriched with 3D spatial semantics. We observe that existing 3D MLLMs offer a comprehensive understanding of point clouds for annotation, while 2D MLLMs excel at cross-validation by providing complementary information. By integrating holistic 2D and 3D insights from off-the-shelf MLLMs, PiSA-Engine enables a continuous cycle of high-quality data generation. We select PointLLM as the baseline and adopt this co-evolution training framework to develop an enhanced 3D MLLM, termed PointLLM-PiSA. Additionally, we identify limitations in previous 3D benchmarks, which often feature coarse language captions and insufficient category diversity, resulting in inaccurate evaluations. To address this gap, we further introduce PiSA-Bench, a comprehensive 3D benchmark covering six key aspects with detailed and diverse labels. Experimental results demonstrate PointLLM-PiSA's state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot 3D object captioning and generative classification on our PiSA-Bench, achieving significant improvements of 46.45% (+8.33%) and 63.75% (+16.25%), respectively.

Despite significant advancements with models like CLIP that align cross-modal representations, a persistent challenge remains: the hubness problem, where a small subset of samples (hubs) dominate as nearest neighbors, leading to biased representations and degraded retrieval accuracy. Existing methods often mitigate hubness through post-hoc normalization techniques, relying on prior data distributions that may not be practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we directly mitigate hubness during training and introduce NeighborRetr, a novel method that effectively balances the learning of hubs and adaptively adjusts the relations of various kinds of neighbors. Our approach not only mitigates the hubness problem but also enhances retrieval performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-modal retrieval benchmarks.

In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset.

A pre-analytical task within this process is the verification of the number of specimen fragments, a process that ensures that the number of fragments on a slide matches the number documented in the macroscopic report. This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting. Additionally, we present findings on interobserver variability, showing that the automated approach achieves an accuracy of 86%, which falls within the range of variation observed among experts (82-88%), further supporting its potential for integration into routine pathology workflows.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Through systematic quantification of distinguishable conscious states and their historical dependencies, we establish that the minimum information required to specify a conscious state exceeds the physical information capacity of the human brain by a significant factor. Our analysis calculates the bit-length requirements for representing consciously distinguishable sensory "stimulus frames" and demonstrates that consciousness exhibits mandatory temporal-historical dependencies that multiply these requirements beyond the brain's storage capabilities. This mathematical approach offers new insights into the fundamental limitations of computational models of consciousness and suggests that non-classical information processing mechanisms may be necessary to account for conscious experience.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

We present Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process before outputting images. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image generation and editing into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements. We define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets containing over 9M samples with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage the advantages of GoT, we implement a unified framework that integrates Qwen2.5-VL for reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by our novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show our GoT framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks, with significant improvements over baselines. Additionally, our approach enables interactive visual generation, allowing users to explicitly modify reasoning steps for precise image adjustments. GoT pioneers a new direction for reasoning-driven visual generation and editing, producing images that better align with human intent.

This critical absence of semantic information leads commercial LVLMs to either ignore the perturbation entirely or misinterpret its embedded semantics, thereby causing the attack to fail. To overcome these issues, we notice that identifying core semantic objects is a key objective for models trained with various datasets and methodologies. This insight motivates our approach that refines semantic clarity by encoding explicit semantic details within local regions, thus ensuring interoperability and capturing finer-grained features, and by concentrating modifications on semantically rich areas rather than applying them uniformly. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet highly effective solution: at each optimization step, the adversarial image is cropped randomly by a controlled aspect ratio and scale, resized, and then aligned with the target image in the embedding space. Experimental results confirm our hypothesis. Our adversarial examples crafted with local-aggregated perturbations focused on crucial regions exhibit surprisingly good transferability to commercial LVLMs, including GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Claude-3.5-sonnet, Claude-3.7-sonnet, and even reasoning models like o1, Claude-3.7-thinking and Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking. Our approach achieves success rates exceeding 90% on GPT-4.5, 4o, and o1, significantly outperforming all prior state-of-the-art attack methods. Our optimized adversarial examples under different configurations and training code are available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/M-Attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at: https://github.com/VILA-Lab/M-Attack</p></details> |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention: Is Learnable Attention Better For Vision Transformers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10632v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are a remarkable innovation consisting of learnable activation functions with the potential to capture more complex relationships from data. Although KANs are useful in finding symbolic representations and continual learning of one-dimensional functions, their effectiveness in diverse machine learning (ML) tasks, such as vision, remains questionable. Presently, KANs are deployed by replacing multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in deep network architectures, including advanced architectures such as vision Transformers (ViTs). In this paper, we are the first to design a general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt) for vanilla ViTs that can operate on any choice of basis. However, the computing and memory costs of training them motivated us to propose a more modular version, and we designed particular learnable attention, called Fourier-KArAt. Fourier-KArAt and its variants either outperform their ViT counterparts or show comparable performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K datasets. We dissect these architectures' performance and generalization capacity by analyzing their loss landscapes, weight distributions, optimizer path, attention visualization, and spectral behavior, and contrast them with vanilla ViTs. The goal of this paper is not to produce parameter- and compute-efficient attention, but to encourage the community to explore KANs in conjunction with more advanced architectures that require a careful understanding of learnable activations. Our open-source code and implementation details are available on: https://subhajitmaity.me/KArAt</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Appendix included</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce SciVerse, a multi-modal scientific evaluation benchmark to thoroughly assess LMMs across 5,735 test instances in five distinct versions. We aim to investigate three key dimensions of LMMs: scientific knowledge comprehension, multi-modal content interpretation, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. To unveil whether LMMs possess sufficient scientific expertise, we first transform each problem into three versions containing different levels of knowledge required for solving, i.e., Knowledge-free, -lite, and -rich. Then, to explore how LMMs interpret multi-modal scientific content, we annotate another two versions, i.e., Vision-rich and -only, marking more question information from texts to diagrams. Comparing the results of different versions, SciVerse systematically examines the professional knowledge stock and visual perception skills of LMMs in scientific domains. In addition, to rigorously assess CoT reasoning, we propose a new scientific CoT evaluation strategy, conducting a step-wise assessment on knowledge and logical errors in model outputs. Our extensive evaluation of different LMMs on SciVerse reveals critical limitations in their scientific proficiency and provides new insights into future developments.

Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lingtengqiu.github.io/LHM/</p></details> |

This work demonstrates that Transformers without normalization can achieve the same or better performance using a remarkably simple technique. We introduce Dynamic Tanh (DyT), an element-wise operation $DyT($x$) = \tanh(\alpha $x$)$, as a drop-in replacement for normalization layers in Transformers. DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, $S$-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models. These findings challenge the conventional understanding that normalization layers are indispensable in modern neural networks, and offer new insights into their role in deep networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; Project page: https://jiachenzhu.github.io/DyT/</p></details> |

While methods such as LoRA impose orthogonality constraints at the weight level, they do not fully address interference in hidden-state representations. We propose Compositional Subspace Representation Fine-tuning (CS-ReFT), a novel representation-based approach that learns multiple orthonormal subspace transformations, each specializing in a distinct skill, and composes them via a lightweight router. By isolating these subspace edits in the hidden state, rather than weight matrices, CS-ReFT prevents cross-task conflicts more effectively. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, applying CS-ReFT to Llama-2-7B achieves a 93.94% win rate, surpassing GPT-3.5 Turbo (86.30%) while requiring only 0.0098% of model parameters. These findings show that specialized representation edits, composed via a simple router, significantly enhance multi-task instruction following with minimal overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 SCOPE</p></details> |

However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability.

However, multimodal reasoning, which requires integrating visual and textual information, remains a significant challenge. Existing visual-language models often struggle to effectively analyze and reason visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on complex reasoning tasks. Moreover, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks hinders the accurate assessment of multimodal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce R1-Onevision, a multimodal reasoning model designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and deep reasoning. To achieve this, we propose a cross-modal reasoning pipeline that transforms images into formal textural representations, enabling precise language-based reasoning. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct the R1-Onevision dataset which provides detailed, step-by-step multimodal reasoning annotations across diverse domains. We further develop the R1-Onevision model through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to cultivate advanced reasoning and robust generalization abilities. To comprehensively evaluate multimodal reasoning performance across different grades, we introduce R1-Onevision-Bench, a benchmark aligned with human educational stages, covering exams from junior high school to university and beyond.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, real-world narrative videos require multi-shot scenes with visual and dynamic consistency across shots. In this work, we introduce Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data. Our method expands full attention mechanisms from individual shots to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. Models with bidirectional attention after LCT can further be fine-tuned with context-causal attention, facilitating auto-regressive generation with efficient KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension, paving the way for more practical visual content creation.

| **[The Spectral Bias of Shallow Neural Network Learning is Shaped by the Choice of Non-linearity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10587v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite classical statistical theory predicting severe overfitting, modern massively overparameterized neural networks still generalize well. This unexpected property is attributed to the network's so-called implicit bias, which describes its propensity to converge to solutions that generalize effectively, among the many possible that correctly label the training data. The aim of our research is to explore this bias from a new perspective, focusing on how non-linear activation functions contribute to shaping it. First, we introduce a reparameterization which removes a continuous weight rescaling symmetry. Second, in the kernel regime, we leverage this reparameterization to generalize recent findings that relate shallow Neural Networks to the Radon transform, deriving an explicit formula for the implicit bias induced by a broad class of activation functions. Specifically, by utilizing the connection between the Radon transform and the Fourier transform, we interpret the kernel regime's inductive bias as minimizing a spectral seminorm that penalizes high-frequency components, in a manner dependent on the activation function. Finally, in the adaptive regime, we demonstrate the existence of local dynamical attractors that facilitate the formation of clusters of hyperplanes where the input to a neuron's activation function is zero, yielding alignment between many neurons' response functions. We confirm these theoretical results with simulations. All together, our work provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the generalization capabilities of overparameterized neural networks and its relation with the implicit bias, offering potential pathways for designing more efficient and robust models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures in main text</p></details> |

However, such promotion is extremely dependent on large-scale high-quality annotated data, which is costly and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose unlocking the value of abundant yet unlabeled data to improve the language-driving model in a semi-supervised learning manner. Specifically, we first introduce a series of template-based prompts to extract scene information, generating questions that create pseudo-answers for the unlabeled data based on a model trained with limited labeled data. Next, we propose a Self-Consistency Refinement method to improve the quality of these pseudo-annotations, which are later used for further training. By utilizing a pre-trained VisionLLM (e.g., InternVL), we build a strong Language Driving Model (LDM) for driving scene question-answering, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on the DriveLM benchmark show that our approach performs well with just 5% labeled data, achieving competitive performance against models trained with full datasets. In particular, our LDM achieves 44.85% performance with limited labeled data, increasing to 54.27% when using unlabeled data, while models trained with full datasets reach 60.68% on the DriveLM benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |

In this work, we aim to address the scarcity issue of reasoning-focused multimodal datasets. We propose VisualWebInstruct - a novel approach that leverages search engine to create a diverse, and high-quality dataset spanning multiple disciplines like math, physics, finance, chemistry, etc. Starting with meticulously selected 30,000 seed images, we employ Google Image search to identify websites containing similar images. We collect and process the HTMLs from over 700K unique URL sources. Through a pipeline of content extraction, filtering and synthesis, we build a dataset of approximately 900K question-answer pairs, with 40% being visual QA pairs and the rest as text QA pairs. Models fine-tuned on VisualWebInstruct demonstrate significant performance gains: (1) training from Llava-OV-mid shows 10-20% absolute point gains across benchmarks, (2) training from MAmmoTH-VL shows 5% absoluate gain. Our best model MAmmoTH-VL2 shows state-of-the-art performance within the 10B parameter class on MMMU-Pro-std (40.7%), MathVerse (42.6%), and DynaMath (55.7%). These remarkable results highlight the effectiveness of our dataset in enhancing VLMs' reasoning capabilities for complex multimodal tasks.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or teachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid, scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into data), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal is to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and evaluated on generated data, and their feedback (in the form of errors or weak skills) is reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes multiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the state representation and action space. More structured environments are based on inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We support 4 domains (math, code, VQA, and tool-use) and test multiple students and teachers. Example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively improve students across tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments teach different skill levels and test variants of key modules, pointing to future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight; Project Page: https://DataEnvGym.github.io</p></details> |

We characterize entropic and distributional properties such as their entropy and relative entropy rates, finite-state compressibility and log loss of their realizations, and the empirical distributions that they induce. Though not quite stationary, these sources are "almost stationary and ergodic;" similar to stationary and ergodic processes, they satisfy a Shannon-McMillan-Breiman-type property: the normalized log probability of their realizations converges almost surely to their entropy rate. Further, they are locally "almost i.i.d." in the sense that the finite-dimensional empirical distributions of their realizations converge almost surely to a deterministic i.i.d. law. However, unlike stationary ergodic sources, the finite-state compressibility of their realizations is almost surely strictly larger than their entropy rate by a "Jensen gap." We present simulations demonstrating the theoretical results. Among their potential uses, these sources allow to gauge the performance of sequential probability models on non-Markovian non-stationary data.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos. Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling. However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns. In this work, we introduce BIMBA, an efficient state-space model to handle long-form videos. Our model leverages the selective scan algorithm to learn to effectively select critical information from high-dimensional video and transform it into a reduced token sequence for efficient LLM processing.

| **[Learning Interpretable Logic Rules from Deep Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10547v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general framework called VisionLogic to extract interpretable logic rules from deep vision models, with a focus on image classification tasks. Given any deep vision model that uses a fully connected layer as the output head, VisionLogic transforms neurons in the last layer into predicates and grounds them into vision concepts using causal validation. In this way, VisionLogic can provide local explanations for single images and global explanations for specific classes in the form of logic rules. Compared to existing interpretable visualization tools such as saliency maps, VisionLogic addresses several key challenges, including the lack of causal explanations, overconfidence in visualizations, and ambiguity in interpretation. VisionLogic also facilitates the study of visual concepts encoded by predicates, particularly how they behave under perturbation -- an area that remains underexplored in the field of hidden semantics. Apart from providing better visual explanations and insights into the visual concepts learned by the model, we show that VisionLogic retains most of the neural network's discriminative power in an interpretable and transparent manner. We envision it as a bridge between complex model behavior and human-understandable explanations, providing trustworthy and actionable insights for real-world applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, many existing approaches overlook the importance of object dynamics, limiting their applicability to more complex, dynamic tasks. In this work, we introduce KUDA, an open-vocabulary manipulation system that integrates dynamics learning and visual prompting through keypoints, leveraging both VLMs and learning-based neural dynamics models. Our key insight is that a keypoint-based target specification is simultaneously interpretable by VLMs and can be efficiently translated into cost functions for model-based planning. Given language instructions and visual observations, KUDA first assigns keypoints to the RGB image and queries the VLM to generate target specifications. These abstract keypoint-based representations are then converted into cost functions, which are optimized using a learned dynamics model to produce robotic trajectories. We evaluate KUDA on a range of manipulation tasks, including free-form language instructions across diverse object categories, multi-object interactions, and deformable or granular objects, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

A pre-analytical task within this process is the verification of the number of specimen fragments, a process that ensures that the number of fragments on a slide matches the number documented in the macroscopic report. This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting. Additionally, we present findings on interobserver variability, showing that the automated approach achieves an accuracy of 86%, which falls within the range of variation observed among experts (82-88%), further supporting its potential for integration into routine pathology workflows.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures; ICLR 2025 camera ready.

Building on Acemoglu and Robinson's 'narrow corridor' framework, we argue that AGI poses distinct risks of pushing societies toward either a 'despotic Leviathan' through enhanced state surveillance and control, or an 'absent Leviathan' through the erosion of state legitimacy relative to AGI-empowered non-state actors. Drawing on public administration theory and recent advances in AI capabilities, we analyze how these dynamics could unfold through three key channels: the automation of discretionary decision-making within agencies, the evolution of bureaucratic structures toward system-level architectures, and the transformation of democratic feedback mechanisms. Our analysis reveals specific failure modes that could destabilize liberal institutions. Enhanced state capacity through AGI could enable unprecedented surveillance and control, potentially entrenching authoritarian practices. Conversely, rapid diffusion of AGI capabilities to non-state actors could undermine state legitimacy and governability. We examine how these risks manifest differently at the micro level of individual bureaucratic decisions, the meso level of organizational structure, and the macro level of democratic processes. To preserve the narrow corridor of liberty, we propose a governance framework emphasizing robust technical safeguards, hybrid institutional designs that maintain meaningful human oversight, and adaptive regulatory mechanisms.</p></details> | 40 pages |

However, little previous work has explored more general interfaces that allow for multiple demonstration types. Given the varied preferences of human demonstrators and task characteristics, a flexible tool that enables multiple demonstration types could be crucial for broader robot skill training. In this work, we propose Versatile Demonstration Interface (VDI), an attachment for collaborative robots that simplifies the collection of three common types of demonstrations. Designed for flexible deployment in industrial settings, our tool requires no additional instrumentation of the environment. Our prototype interface captures human demonstrations through a combination of vision, force sensing, and state tracking (e.g., through the robot proprioception or AprilTag tracking). Through a user study where we deployed our prototype VDI at a local manufacturing innovation center with manufacturing experts, we demonstrated VDI in representative industrial tasks. Interactions from our study highlight the practical value of VDI's varied demonstration types, expose a range of industrial use cases for VDI, and provide insights for future tool design.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Explainable Bayesian deep learning through input-skip Latent Binary Bayesian Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10496v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling natural phenomena with artificial neural networks (ANNs) often provides highly accurate predictions. However, ANNs often suffer from over-parameterization, complicating interpretation and raising uncertainty issues. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address the latter by representing weights as probability distributions, allowing for predictive uncertainty evaluation. Latent binary Bayesian neural networks (LBBNNs) further handle structural uncertainty and sparsify models by removing redundant weights. This article advances LBBNNs by enabling covariates to skip to any succeeding layer or be excluded, simplifying networks and clarifying input impacts on predictions. Ultimately, a linear model or even a constant can be found to be optimal for a specific problem at hand. Furthermore, the input-skip LBBNN approach reduces network density significantly compared to standard LBBNNs, achieving over 99% reduction for small networks and over 99.9% for larger ones, while still maintaining high predictive accuracy and uncertainty measurement. For example, on MNIST, we reached 97% accuracy and great calibration with just 935 weights, reaching state-of-the-art for compression of neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed method accurately identifies the true covariates and adjusts for system non-linearity. The main contribution is the introduction of active paths, enhancing directly designed global and local explanations within the LBBNN framework, that have theoretical guarantees and do not require post hoc external tools for explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 19 tables, 25 figures.

Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems. In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$-factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6+1 p...</summary><p>6+1 pages, 4 figures.

In this paper, we propose WSI (Whisper Speaker Identification), a framework that repurposes the encoder of the Whisper automatic speech recognition model pre trained on extensive multilingual data to generate robust speaker embeddings via a joint loss optimization strategy that leverages online hard triplet mining and self supervised Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy loss. By capitalizing on Whisper language-agnostic acoustic representations, our approach effectively distinguishes speakers across diverse languages and recording conditions. Extensive evaluations on multiple corpora, including VoxTube (multilingual), JVS (Japanese), CallHome (German, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese), and Voxconverse (English), demonstrate that WSI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, namely Pyannote Embedding, ECAPA TDNN, and Xvector, in terms of lower equal error rates and higher AUC scores. These results validate our hypothesis that a multilingual pre-trained ASR encoder, combined with joint loss optimization, substantially improves speaker identification performance in non-English languages.</p></details> | 6 pages |

While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations, achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes, it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP, designed for static image-text tasks, cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned, object-wise video features, which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges, we propose 4D LangSplat, which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method, consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed, temporally consistent, high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings, which then serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states, we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

To effectively plan in this setting, in contrast to learning world dynamics in a single-agent scenario, we must simulate world dynamics conditioned on an arbitrary number of agents' actions given only partial egocentric visual observations of the world. To address this issue of partial observability, we first train generative models to estimate the overall world state given partial egocentric observations. To enable accurate simulation of multiple sets of actions on this world state, we then propose to learn a compositional world model for multi-agent cooperation by factorizing the naturally composable joint actions of multiple agents and compositionally generating the video conditioned on the world state. By leveraging this compositional world model, in combination with Vision Language Models to infer the actions of other agents, we can use a tree search procedure to integrate these modules and facilitate online cooperative planning. We evaluate our methods on three challenging benchmarks with 2-4 agents. The results show our compositional world model is effective and the framework enables the embodied agents to cooperate efficiently with different agents across various tasks and an arbitrary number of agents, showing the promising future of our proposed methods.

However, empowering Large Language Models to perceive and generate images, texts, and speeches end-to-end with publicly available data remains challenging for the open-source community. Existing vision-language models rely on external tools for speech processing, while speech-language models still suffer from limited or totally without vision-understanding capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the EMOVA (EMotionally Omni-present Voice Assistant), to enable Large Language Models with end-to-end speech abilities while maintaining the leading vision-language performance. With a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer, we surprisingly notice that omni-modal alignment can further enhance vision-language and speech abilities compared with the bi-modal aligned counterparts. Moreover, a lightweight style module is introduced for the flexible speech style controls including emotions and pitches. For the first time, EMOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the vision-language and speech benchmarks, and meanwhile, supporting omni-modal spoken dialogue with vivid emotions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

To design these innovative materials, it is important to be able to simulate them accurately and quickly, in order to tune their mechanical properties. Since conventional simulations using the finite element method entail a high computational cost, in this article we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach that scales favorably to serve as a surrogate model. To ensure that the model is also able to handle various microstructures, including those not encountered during training, we include the microstructure as part of the network input. Therefore, we introduce a graph neural network that predicts global quantities (energy, stress stiffness) as well as the pattern transformations that occur (the kinematics). To make our model as accurate and data-efficient as possible, various symmetries are incorporated into the model. The starting point is an E(n)-equivariant graph neural network (which respects translation, rotation and reflection) that has periodic boundary conditions (i.e., it is in-/equivariant with respect to the choice of RVE), is scale in-/equivariant, can simulate large deformations, and can predict scalars, vectors as well as second and fourth order tensors (specifically energy, stress and stiffness). The incorporation of scale equivariance makes the model equivariant with respect to the similarities group, of which the Euclidean group E(n) is a subgroup. We show that this network is more accurate and data-efficient than graph neural networks with fewer symmetries. To create an efficient graph representation of the finite element discretization, we use only the internal geometrical hole boundaries from the finite element mesh to achieve a better speed-up and scaling with the mesh size.</p></details> | <details><summary>60 pa...</summary><p>60 pages, 22 figures.

So far, the method was restricted to single linear direct recursive rules in the programming language Constraint Handling Rules (CHR). In this companion paper, we generalize the technique to multiple recursion and to multiple recursive rules and provide an implementation of the generalized method in the logic programming language Prolog. The basic idea of the approach is as follows: When a recursive call is encountered at runtime, the recursive rule is unfolded with itself and this process is repeated with each resulting unfolded rule as long as it is applicable to the current call. In this way, more and more recursive steps are combined into one recursive step. Then an interpreter applies these rules to the call starting from the most unfolded rule. For recursions which have sufficiently simplifyable unfoldings, a super-linear can be achieved, i.e. the time complexity is reduced. We implement an unfolder, a generalized meta-interpreter and a novel round-robin rule processor for our generalization of runtime repeated recursion unfolding with just ten clauses in Prolog. We illustrate the feasibility of our technique with worst-case time complexity estimates and benchmarks for some basic classical algorithms that achieve a super-linear speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2307.02180</p></details> |

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works.In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map, which reveals that what the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, the $\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image, while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps. Remarkably, READ features an intuitive design, Similarity as Points module (SasP), which can be seamlessly applied to $\texttt{<SEG>}$-like paradigms in a plug-and-play fashion. Also, extensive experiments have been conducted on ReasonSeg and RefCOCO(+/g) datasets. To validate whether READ suffers from catastrophic forgetting of previous skills after fine-tuning, we further assess its generation ability on an augmented FP-RefCOCO(+/g) dataset.

The development of natural language processing (NLP), text mining, and deep learning has notably amplified the efficacy of text summarization models for abundant types of documents. Summarizing patent text remains a pertinent challenge due to the labyrinthine writing style of these documents, which includes technical and legal intricacies. Additionally, these patent document contents are considerably lengthier than archetypal documents, which intricates the process of extracting pertinent information for summarization. Embodying extractive and abstractive text summarization methodologies into a hybrid framework, this study proposes a system for efficiently creating abstractive summaries of patent records. The procedure involves leveraging the LexRank graph-based algorithm to retrieve the important sentences from input parent texts, then utilizing a Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART) model that has been fine-tuned using Low-Ranking Adaptation (LoRA) for producing text summaries. This is accompanied by methodical testing and evaluation strategies.

We propose a novel imitation learning-based viewpoint planning approach to actively adjust camera viewpoint and capture unobstructed images of the target crop. Traditional viewpoint planners and existing learning-based methods, depend on manually designed evaluation metrics or reward functions, often struggle to generalize to complex, unseen scenarios. Our method employs the Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT) algorithm to learn effective camera motion policies from expert demonstrations. This enables continuous six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) viewpoint adjustments that are smoother, more precise and reveal occluded targets. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, featuring agricultural scenarios and a 6-DoF robot arm equipped with an RGB-D camera, demonstrate our method's superior success rate and efficiency, especially in complex occlusion conditions, as well as its ability to generalize across different crops without reprogramming. This study advances robotic harvesting by providing a practical "learn from demonstration" (LfD) solution to occlusion challenges, ultimately enhancing autonomous harvesting performance and productivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Furthermore, LiteVLP exhibits superior inference speed while maintaining exceptional high accuracy. In long-horizon manipulation tasks, LiteVLP also shows remarkable memory ability, outperforming the best-performing baseline model by 18.8%.

A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA-2025, Atlanta</p></details> |

This comprehensive study extends our previous research on SYCL's performance portability by evaluating its effectiveness across a broader spectrum of computing architectures, including CPUs, GPUs, and hybrid CPU-GPU configurations from NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD. Our analysis covers single-GPU, multi-GPU, single-CPU, and CPU-GPU hybrid setups, using two common, bioinformatic applications as a case study.

SYCL also demonstrated remarkable versatility and effectiveness across CPUs from various manufacturers, including the latest hybrid architectures from Intel. Although SYCL showed excellent functional portability in hybrid CPU-GPU configurations, performance varied significantly based on specific hardware combinations. Some performance limitations were identified in multi-GPU and CPU-GPU configurations, primarily attributed to workload distribution strategies rather than SYCL-specific constraints. These findings position SYCL as a promising unified programming model for heterogeneous computing environments, particularly for bioinformatic applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2309.09609</p></details> |

This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets.

In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model.

Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning. Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[LHM: Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model from a Single Image in Seconds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10625v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animatable 3D human reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem due to the ambiguity in decoupling geometry, appearance, and deformation. Recent advances in 3D human reconstruction mainly focus on static human modeling, and the reliance of using synthetic 3D scans for training limits their generalization ability. Conversely, optimization-based video methods achieve higher fidelity but demand controlled capture conditions and computationally intensive refinement processes. Motivated by the emergence of large reconstruction models for efficient static reconstruction, we propose LHM (Large Animatable Human Reconstruction Model) to infer high-fidelity avatars represented as 3D Gaussian splatting in a feed-forward pass. Our model leverages a multimodal transformer architecture to effectively encode the human body positional features and image features with attention mechanism, enabling detailed preservation of clothing geometry and texture. To further boost the face identity preservation and fine detail recovery, we propose a head feature pyramid encoding scheme to aggregate multi-scale features of the head regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LHM generates plausible animatable human in seconds without post-processing for face and hands, outperforming existing methods in both reconstruction accuracy and generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://lingtengqiu.github.io/LHM/</p></details> |

One particularly challenging task is autonomous driving, which demands thorough cognitive processing before decisions can be made. In this domain, a sequential and interpretive understanding of visual cues is essential for effective perception, prediction, and planning. Nevertheless, common VQA benchmarks often focus on the accuracy of the final answer while overlooking the reasoning process that enables the generation of accurate responses. Moreover, existing methods lack a comprehensive framework for evaluating step-by-step reasoning in realistic driving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose DriveLMM-o1, a new dataset and benchmark specifically designed to advance step-wise visual reasoning for autonomous driving. Our benchmark features over 18k VQA examples in the training set and more than 4k in the test set, covering diverse questions on perception, prediction, and planning, each enriched with step-by-step reasoning to ensure logical inference in autonomous driving scenarios. We further introduce a large multimodal model that is fine-tuned on our reasoning dataset, demonstrating robust performance in complex driving scenarios. In addition, we benchmark various open-source and closed-source methods on our proposed dataset, systematically comparing their reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving tasks. Our model achieves a +7.49% gain in final answer accuracy, along with a 3.62% improvement in reasoning score over the previous best open-source model.

However, the existing open-vocabulary tracker is constrained by its framework structure, isolated frame-level perception, and insufficient modal interactions, which hinder its performance in open-vocabulary classification and tracking. In this paper, we propose OVTR (End-to-End Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking with TRansformer), the first end-to-end open-vocabulary tracker that models motion, appearance, and category simultaneously. To achieve stable classification and continuous tracking, we design the CIP (Category Information Propagation) strategy, which establishes multiple high-level category information priors for subsequent frames. Additionally, we introduce a dual-branch structure for generalization capability and deep multimodal interaction, and incorporate protective strategies in the decoder to enhance performance. Experimental results show that our method surpasses previous trackers on the open-vocabulary MOT benchmark while also achieving faster inference speeds and significantly reducing preprocessing requirements. Moreover, the experiment transferring the model to another dataset demonstrates its strong adaptability.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) indicate that internal states, such as hidden states, encode the "overall truthfulness" of generated responses. However, it remains under-explored how internal states in LVLMs function and whether they could serve as "per-token" hallucination indicators, which is essential for mitigating OH. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth exploration of LVLM internal states in relation to OH issues and discover that (1) LVLM internal states are high-specificity per-token indicators of hallucination behaviors. Moreover, (2) different LVLMs encode universal patterns of hallucinations in common latent subspaces, indicating that there exist "generic truthful directions" shared by various LVLMs. Based on these discoveries, we propose Truthful-Guided Pre-Intervention (TruthPrInt) that first learns the truthful direction of LVLM decoding and then applies truthful-guided inference-time intervention during LVLM decoding. We further propose ComnHallu to enhance both cross-LVLM and cross-data hallucination detection transferability by constructing and aligning hallucination latent subspaces. We evaluate TruthPrInt in extensive experimental settings, including in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, over popular LVLMs and OH benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that TruthPrInt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, parameters tied to specific tasks often remain inactive for other tasks, making mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures a natural extension. Despite this, MoEs often show inconsistent behavior, with some experts unexpectedly generalizing across tasks while others struggle within their intended scope. This hinders leveraging MoEs' computational benefits by bypassing irrelevant experts during inference. We attribute this undesired behavior to the uniform and rigid architecture of traditional MoEs. To address this, we introduce ``complexity experts" -- flexible expert blocks with varying computational complexity and receptive fields. A key challenge is assigning tasks to each expert, as degradation complexity is unknown in advance. Thus, we execute tasks with a simple bias toward lower complexity. To our surprise, this preference effectively drives task-specific allocation, assigning tasks to experts with the appropriate complexity. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating the ability to bypass irrelevant experts during inference while maintaining superior performance. The proposed MoCE-IR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, affirming its efficiency and practical applicability.

| **[DataEnvGym: Data Generation Agents in Teacher Environments with Student Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06215v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The process of creating training data to teach models is currently driven by humans, who manually analyze model weaknesses and plan how to create data that improves a student model. Approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or teachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid, scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into data), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal is to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and evaluated on generated data, and their feedback (in the form of errors or weak skills) is reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes multiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the state representation and action space. More structured environments are based on inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We support 4 domains (math, code, VQA, and tool-use) and test multiple students and teachers. Example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively improve students across tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments teach different skill levels and test variants of key modules, pointing to future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight; Project Page: https://DataEnvGym.github.io</p></details> |

Though forming the foundation of Transformer models, the dot-product attention does not scale well to long-context data since its time requirement grows quadratically with context length. In this work, we propose Radar, a training-free approach that accelerates inference by dynamically searching for the most important context tokens. For any pre-trained Transformer, Radar can reduce the decoding time complexity without training or heuristically evicting tokens. Moreover, we provide theoretical justification for our approach, demonstrating that Radar can reliably identify the most important tokens with high probability. We conduct extensive comparisons with the previous methods on a wide range of tasks. The results demonstrate that Radar achieves the state-of-the-art performance across different architectures with reduced time complexity, offering a practical solution for efficient long-context processing of Transformers.</p></details> | Accepted @ ICLR 2025 |

The self-attention mechanism provides a general solution for sequence modeling, but it has a prohibitive cost when applied to a massive number of spatiotemporal tokens in long videos. Most prior methods rely on compression strategies to lower the computational cost, such as reducing the input length via sparse frame sampling or compressing the output sequence passed to the large language model (LLM) via space-time pooling. However, these naive approaches over-represent redundant information and often miss salient events or fast-occurring space-time patterns. In this work, we introduce BIMBA, an efficient state-space model to handle long-form videos. Our model leverages the selective scan algorithm to learn to effectively select critical information from high-dimensional video and transform it into a reduced token sequence for efficient LLM processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BIMBA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple long-form VQA benchmarks, including PerceptionTest, NExT-QA, EgoSchema, VNBench, LongVideoBench, and Video-MME.

However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures; ICLR 2025 camera ready.

In this research track, we propose the Chain-of-Embedding (CoE) in the latent space to enable LLMs to perform output-free self-evaluation. CoE consists of all progressive hidden states produced during the inference time, which can be treated as the latent thinking path of LLMs. We find that when LLMs respond correctly and incorrectly, their CoE features differ, these discrepancies assist us in estimating LLM response correctness. Experiments in four diverse domains and seven LLMs fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Meanwhile, its label-free design intent without any training and millisecond-level computational cost ensures real-time feedback in large-scale scenarios. More importantly, we provide interesting insights into LLM response correctness from the perspective of hidden state changes inside LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This problem is well-known to be equivalent to a natural tournament ranking problem, whose task is to rank players in a tournament such that the number of pairs in which the lower-ranked player defeats the higher-ranked player is no more than $k$. Using the PTAS for Subset-FAST [STOC 2007], Bessy et al. [JCSS 2011] present a $(2 + \varepsilon)k$-vertex kernel for this problem, given any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$. A generalization of Subset-FAST, called Subset-FAST, further includes an additional terminal subset $T \subseteq V(D)$ in the input. The goal of Subset-FAST is to determine whether there is an arc set $S \subseteq A(D)$ of size at most $k$ whose removal ensures that no directed cycle passes through any terminal in $T$. Prior to our work, no polynomial kernel for Subset-FAST was known. In our work, we show that Subset-FAST admits an $\mathcal{O}((\alpha k)^{2})$-vertex kernel, provided that Subset-FAST has an approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio $\alpha$. Consequently, based on the known $\mathcal{O}(\log k \log \log k)$-approximation algorithm, we obtain an almost quadratic kernel for Subset-FAST.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

However, when we apply 3DGS to surface reconstruction tasks, especially in environments with dynamic objects and distractors, the method suffers from floating artifacts and color errors due to inconsistency from different viewpoints. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-View Consistency Gaussian Splatting for the domain of Robust Surface Reconstruction (\textbf{MVGSR}), which takes advantage of lightweight Gaussian models and a {heuristics-guided distractor masking} strategy for robust surface reconstruction in non-static environments. Compared to existing methods that rely on MLPs for distractor segmentation strategies, our approach separates distractors from static scene elements by comparing multi-view feature consistency, allowing us to obtain precise distractor masks early in training. Furthermore, we introduce a pruning measure based on multi-view contributions to reset transmittance, effectively reducing floating artifacts. Finally, a multi-view consistency loss is applied to achieve high-quality performance in surface reconstruction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MVGSR achieves competitive geometric accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to the state-of-the-art surface reconstruction algorithms.

As a result, increasing attention has been given to assessing the true reasoning capabilities of LLMs, driving research into commonsense, numerical, logical, and qualitative reasoning. However, with the rapid progress of reasoning-focused models such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1, there has been a growing demand for reasoning benchmarks that can keep pace with ongoing model developments. In this paper, we introduce MastermindEval, a simple, scalable, and interpretable deductive reasoning benchmark inspired by the board game Mastermind. Our benchmark supports two evaluation paradigms: (1) agentic evaluation, in which the model autonomously plays the game, and (2) deductive reasoning evaluation, in which the model is given a pre-played game state with only one possible valid code to infer. In our experimental results we (1) find that even easy Mastermind instances are difficult for current models and (2) demonstrate that the benchmark is scalable to possibly more advanced models in the future Furthermore, we investigate possible reasons why models cannot deduce the final solution and find that current models are limited in deducing the concealed code as the number of statement to combine information from is increasing.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables.

To effectively plan in this setting, in contrast to learning world dynamics in a single-agent scenario, we must simulate world dynamics conditioned on an arbitrary number of agents' actions given only partial egocentric visual observations of the world. To address this issue of partial observability, we first train generative models to estimate the overall world state given partial egocentric observations. To enable accurate simulation of multiple sets of actions on this world state, we then propose to learn a compositional world model for multi-agent cooperation by factorizing the naturally composable joint actions of multiple agents and compositionally generating the video conditioned on the world state. By leveraging this compositional world model, in combination with Vision Language Models to infer the actions of other agents, we can use a tree search procedure to integrate these modules and facilitate online cooperative planning. We evaluate our methods on three challenging benchmarks with 2-4 agents. The results show our compositional world model is effective and the framework enables the embodied agents to cooperate efficiently with different agents across various tasks and an arbitrary number of agents, showing the promising future of our proposed methods.

However, a large amount of data needed for enabling deep learning is stored on personal devices, and recent concerns on privacy have further highlighted challenges for accessing such data. As a result, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important privacy-preserving technology that enables collaborative training of machine learning models without the need to send the raw, potentially sensitive, data to a central server. However, the fundamental premise that sending model updates to a server is privacy-preserving only holds if the updates cannot be "reverse engineered" to infer information about the private training data. It has been shown under a wide variety of settings that this privacy premise does not hold. In this survey paper, we provide a comprehensive literature review of the different privacy attacks and defense methods in FL. We identify the current limitations of these attacks and highlight the settings in which the privacy of ann FL client can be broken. We further dissect some of the successful industry applications of FL and draw lessons for future successful adoption. We survey the emerging landscape of privacy regulation for FL and conclude with future directions for taking FL toward the cherished goal of generating accurate models while preserving the privacy of the data from its participants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Computing Surveys; 35 pages</p></details> |

This success is largely attributed to the effectiveness of molecular tokenization strategies. In protein science, the amino acid sequence serves as the sole tokenizer for LLMs. However, many fundamental challenges in protein science are inherently structure-dependent. The absence of structure-aware tokens significantly limits the capabilities of LLMs for comprehensive biomolecular comprehension and multimodal generation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, ProtTeX, which tokenizes the protein sequences, structures, and textual information into a unified discrete space. This innovative approach enables joint training of the LLM exclusively through the Next-Token Prediction paradigm, facilitating multimodal protein reasoning and generation. ProtTeX enables general LLMs to perceive and process protein structures through sequential text input, leverage structural information as intermediate reasoning components, and generate or manipulate structures via sequential text output. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in protein function prediction, outperforming the state-of-the-art domain expert model with a twofold increase in accuracy. Our framework enables high-quality conformational generation and customizable protein design. For the first time, we demonstrate that by adopting the standard training and inference pipelines from the LLM domain, ProtTeX empowers decoder-only LLMs to effectively address diverse spectrum of protein-related tasks.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Existing DL framework testing tools have limited coverage on bug types. For example, they lack the capability of finding performance bugs, which are critical for DL model training and inference regarding performance, economics, and the environment. This problem is challenging due to the difficulty of getting test oracles of performance bugs. Moreover, existing tools are inefficient, generating hundreds of test cases with few trigger bugs. In this paper, we propose Citadel, a method that accelerates the finding of bugs in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. We observe that many DL framework bugs are similar due to the similarity of operators and algorithms belonging to the same family (e.g., Conv2D and Conv3D). Orthogonal to existing bug-finding tools, Citadel aims to find new bugs that are similar to reported ones that have known test oracles. It works by first collecting existing bug reports and identifying problematic APIs. Citadel defines context similarity to measure the similarity of DL framework API pairs and automatically generates test cases with oracles for APIs that are similar to the problematic APIs in existing bug reports. Citadel respectively covers 1,436 PyTorch and 5,380 TensorFlow APIs and effectively detects 77 and 74 API bugs, many of which, e.g., 11 performance bugs, cannot be detected by existing tools. Moreover, a remarkable 35.40% of the test cases generated by Citadel can trigger bugs, which significantly transcends the state-of-the-art method (3.90%).</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

This paper presents an Efficient End-to-End Grasp Detection Network (E3GNet) for 6-DoF grasp detection utilizing hierarchical heatmap representations. E3GNet effectively identifies high-quality and diverse grasps in cluttered real-world environments.Benefiting from our end-to-end methodology and efficient network design, our approach surpasses previous methods in model inference efficiency and achieves real-time 6-Dof grasp detection on edge devices. Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a satisfactory 94% object grasping success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems</p></details> |
| **[SCOOP: A Framework for Proactive Collaboration and Social Continual Learning through Natural Language Interaction andCausal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10241v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal information-gathering settings, where users collaborate with AI in dynamic environments, are increasingly common. These involve complex processes with textual and multimodal interactions, often requiring additional structural information via cost-incurring requests. AI helpers lack access to users' true goals, beliefs, and preferences and struggle to integrate diverse information effectively. We propose a social continual learning framework for causal knowledge acquisition and collaborative decision-making. It focuses on autonomous agents learning through dialogues, question-asking, and interaction in open, partially observable environments. A key component is a natural language oracle that answers the agent's queries about environmental mechanisms and states, refining causal understanding while balancing exploration or learning, and exploitation or knowledge use. Evaluation tasks inspired by developmental psychology emphasize causal reasoning and question-asking skills. They complement benchmarks by assessing the agent's ability to identify knowledge gaps, generate meaningful queries, and incrementally update reasoning. The framework also evaluates how knowledge acquisition costs are amortized across tasks within the same environment. We propose two architectures: 1) a system combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with the ReAct framework and question-generation, and 2) an advanced system with a causal world model, symbolic, graph-based, or subsymbolic, for reasoning and decision-making. The latter builds a causal knowledge graph for efficient inference and adaptability under constraints. Challenges include integrating causal reasoning into ReAct and optimizing exploration and question-asking in error-prone scenarios. Beyond applications, this framework models developmental processes combining causal reasoning, question generation, and social learning.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[I Can Tell Your Secrets: Inferring Privacy Attributes from Mini-app Interaction History in Super-apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10239v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super-apps have emerged as comprehensive platforms integrating various mini-apps to provide diverse services. While super-apps offer convenience and enriched functionality, they can introduce new privacy risks. This paper reveals a new privacy leakage source in super-apps: mini-app interaction history, including mini-app usage history (Mini-H) and operation history (Op-H). Mini-H refers to the history of mini-apps accessed by users, such as their frequency and categories. Op-H captures user interactions within mini-apps, including button clicks, bar drags, and image views. Super-apps can naturally collect these data without instrumentation due to the web-based feature of mini-apps. We identify these data types as novel and unexplored privacy risks through a literature review of 30 papers and an empirical analysis of 31 super-apps. We design a mini-app interaction history-oriented inference attack (THEFT), to exploit this new vulnerability. Using THEFT, the insider threats within the low-privilege business department of the super-app vendor acting as the adversary can achieve more than 95.5% accuracy in inferring privacy attributes of over 16.1% of users. THEFT only requires a small training dataset of 200 users from public breached databases on the Internet. We also engage with super-app vendors and a standards association to increase industry awareness and commitment to protect this data. Our contributions are significant in identifying overlooked privacy risks, demonstrating the effectiveness of a new attack, and influencing industry practices toward better privacy protection in the super-app ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |

However, current amodal segmentation methods lack the capability to interact with users through text input and struggle to understand or reason about implicit and complex purposes. While methods like LISA integrate multi-modal large language models (LLMs) with segmentation for reasoning tasks, they are limited to predicting only visible object regions and face challenges in handling complex occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task named amodal reasoning segmentation, aiming to predict the complete amodal shape of occluded objects while providing answers with elaborations based on user text input. We develop a generalizable dataset generation pipeline and introduce a new dataset focusing on daily life scenarios, encompassing diverse real-world occlusions. Furthermore, we present AURA (Amodal Understanding and Reasoning Assistant), a novel model with advanced global and spatial-level designs specifically tailored to handle complex occlusions. Extensive experiments validate AURA's effectiveness on the proposed dataset. The code, model, and dataset will be publicly released.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To accelerate inference in such models, we derive, for the first time, an analog of the probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) in infinite-dimensional function spaces. Leveraging this newly formulated PF-ODE, we reduce the number of function evaluations while maintaining sample quality in function generation tasks, including applications to PDEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 8 figures.

| **[The R2D2 Deep Neural Network Series for Scalable Non-Cartesian Magnetic Resonance Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09559v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series paradigm for fast and scalable image reconstruction from highly-accelerated non-Cartesian k-space acquisitions in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While unrolled DNN architectures provide a robust image formation approach via data-consistency layers, embedding non-uniform fast Fourier transform operators in a DNN can become impractical to train at large scale, e.g in 2D MRI with a large number of coils, or for higher-dimensional imaging. Plug-and-play approaches that alternate a learned denoiser blind to the measurement setting with a data-consistency step are not affected by this limitation but their highly iterative nature implies slow reconstruction. To address this scalability challenge, we leverage the R2D2 paradigm that was recently introduced to enable ultra-fast reconstruction for large-scale Fourier imaging in radio astronomy. R2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images iteratively estimated as outputs of DNN modules taking the previous iteration's data residual as input. The method can be interpreted as a learned version of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. A series of R2D2 DNN modules were sequentially trained in a supervised manner on the fastMRI dataset and validated for 2D multi-coil MRI in simulation and on real data, targeting highly under-sampled radial k-space sampling. Results suggest that a series with only few DNNs achieves superior reconstruction quality over its unrolled incarnation R2D2-Net (whose training is also much less scalable), and over the state-of-the-art diffusion-based "Decomposed Diffusion Sampler" approach (also characterised by a slower reconstruction process).</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

This paper explores whether high-quality visual features alone are sufficient to rival existing state-of-the-art vision-language models. We affirm this by adapting DINOv2 for one-shot and few-shot anomaly detection, with a focus on industrial applications. We show that this approach does not only rival existing techniques but can even outmatch them in many settings. Our proposed vision-only approach, AnomalyDINO, follows the well-established patch-level deep nearest neighbor paradigm, and enables both image-level anomaly prediction and pixel-level anomaly segmentation. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. The approach is methodologically simple and training-free and, thus, does not require any additional data for fine-tuning or meta-learning. Despite its simplicity, AnomalyDINO achieves state-of-the-art results in one- and few-shot anomaly detection (e.g., pushing the one-shot performance on MVTec-AD from an AUROC of 93.1% to 96.6%). The reduced overhead, coupled with its outstanding few-shot performance, makes AnomalyDINO a strong candidate for fast deployment, e.g., in industrial contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Inversion Attack against Collaborative Inference of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09022v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied for their remarkable capability of content generation. However, the practical use of open-source LLMs is hindered by high resource requirements, making deployment expensive and limiting widespread development. The collaborative inference is a promising solution for this problem, in which users collaborate by each hosting a subset of layers and transmitting intermediate activation. Many companies are building collaborative inference platforms to reduce LLM serving costs, leveraging users' underutilized GPUs. Despite widespread interest in collaborative inference within academia and industry, the privacy risks associated with LLM collaborative inference have not been well studied. This is largely because of the challenge posed by inverting LLM activation due to its strong non-linearity. In this paper, to validate the severity of privacy threats in LLM collaborative inference, we introduce the concept of prompt inversion attack (PIA), where a malicious participant intends to recover the input prompt through the activation transmitted by its previous participant. Extensive experiments show that our PIA method substantially outperforms existing baselines. For example, our method achieves an 88.4\% token accuracy on the Skytrax dataset with the Llama-65B model when inverting the maximum number of transformer layers, while the best baseline method only achieves 22.8\% accuracy. The results verify the effectiveness of our PIA attack and highlights its practical threat to LLM collaborative inference systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2025</p></details> |
| **[An Information-Theoretic Regularizer for Lossy Neural Image Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16727v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lossy image compression networks aim to minimize the latent entropy of images while adhering to specific distortion constraints. However, optimizing the neural network can be challenging due to its nature of learning quantized latent representations. In this paper, our key finding is that minimizing the latent entropy is, to some extent, equivalent to maximizing the conditional source entropy, an insight that is deeply rooted in information-theoretic equalities. Building on this insight, we propose a novel structural regularization method for the neural image compression task by incorporating the negative conditional source entropy into the training objective, such that both the optimization efficacy and the model's generalization ability can be promoted. The proposed information-theoretic regularizer is interpretable, plug-and-play, and imposes no inference overheads. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority in regularizing the models and further squeezing bits from the latent representation across various compression structures and unseen domains.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AnywhereDoor: Multi-Target Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06529v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As object detection becomes integral to many safety-critical applications, understanding its vulnerabilities is essential. Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim models, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors during inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target attacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target) before training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large output space of object detection (including object existence prediction, bounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible, inference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate new ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones, offering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of supported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against region-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack success rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was intended as a replacement of arXiv:2411.14243 and any subsequent updates will appear there</p></details> |

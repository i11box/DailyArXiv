| **[3D Aware Region Prompted Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13317v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://www.anjiecheng.me/sr3d</p></details> |
| **[Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13316v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[ReSum: Unlocking Long-Horizon Search Intelligence via Context Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13313v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation, we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of 4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |
| **[Towards General Agentic Intelligence via Environment Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13311v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks, tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model, AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Agents via Continual Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13310v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving. However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably 39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |
| **[WebSailor-V2: Bridging the Chasm to Proprietary Agents via Synthetic Data and Scalable Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13305v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability. Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks, matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research/</p></details> |
| **[QDFlow: A Python package for physics simulations of quantum dot devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13298v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Investigating Seamless Transitions Between Immersive Computational Notebooks and Embodied Data Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13295v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing interest in Immersive Analytics (IA) has led to the extension of computational notebooks (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) into an immersive environment to enhance analytical workflows. However, existing solutions rely on the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) metaphor, which remains impractical for complex data exploration. Although embodied interaction offers a more intuitive alternative, immersive computational notebooks and embodied data exploration systems are implemented as standalone tools. This separation requires analysts to invest considerable effort to transition from one environment to an entirely different one during analytical workflows. To address this, we introduce ICoN, a prototype that facilitates a seamless transition between computational notebooks and embodied data explorations within a unified, fully immersive environment. Our findings reveal that unification improves transition efficiency and intuitiveness during analytical workflows, highlighting its potential for seamless data analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, The ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST)</p></details> |
| **[JoPA:Explaining Large Language Model's Generation via Joint Prompt Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20404v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in complex text generation tasks. However, the contribution of the input prompt to the generated content still remains obscure to humans, underscoring the necessity of understanding the causality between input and output pairs. Existing works for providing prompt-specific explanation often confine model output to be classification or next-word prediction. Few initial attempts aiming to explain the entire language generation often treat input prompt texts independently, ignoring their combinatorial effects on the follow-up generation. In this study, we introduce a counterfactual explanation framework based on Joint Prompt Attribution, JoPA, which aims to explain how a few prompt texts collaboratively influences the LLM's complete generation. Particularly, we formulate the task of prompt attribution for generation interpretation as a combinatorial optimization problem, and introduce a probabilistic algorithm to search for the casual input combination in the discrete space. We define and utilize multiple metrics to evaluate the produced explanations, demonstrating both the faithfulness and efficiency of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Inferring Soil Drydown Behaviour with Adaptive Bayesian Online Changepoint Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13293v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous soil-moisture measurements provide a direct lens on subsurface hydrological processes, notably the post-rainfall "drydown" phase. Because these records consist of distinct, segment-specific behaviours whose forms and scales vary over time, realistic inference demands a model that captures piecewise dynamics while accommodating parameters that are unknown a priori. Building on Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD), we introduce two complementary extensions: a particle-filter variant that substitutes exact marginalisation with sequential Monte Carlo to enable real-time inference when critical parameters cannot be integrated out analytically, and an online-gradient variant that embeds stochastic gradient updates within BOCPD to learn application-relevant parameters on the fly without prohibitive computational cost. After validating both algorithms on synthetic data that replicate the temporal structure of field observations-detailing hyperparameter choices, priors, and cost-saving strategies-we apply them to soil-moisture series from experimental sites in Austria and the United States, quantifying site-specific drydown rates and demonstrating the advantages of our adaptive framework over static models.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages of main manuscript and 3 pages if supplemental document</p></details> |
| **[De Finetti + Sanov = Bayes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13283v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a framework for the operationalization of models and parameters by combining de Finetti's representation theorem with a conditional form of Sanov's theorem. This synthesis, the tilted de Finetti theorem, shows that conditioning exchangeable sequences on empirical moment constraints yields predictive laws in exponential families via the I-projection of a baseline measure. Parameters emerge as limits of empirical functionals, providing a probabilistic foundation for maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principles. This explains why exponential tilting governs likelihood methods and Bayesian updating, connecting naturally to finite-sample concentration rates that anticipate PAC-Bayes bounds. Examples include Gaussian scale mixtures, where symmetry uniquely selects location-scale families, and Jaynes' Brandeis dice problem, where partial information tilts the uniform law. Broadly, the theorem unifies exchangeability, large deviations, and entropy concentration, clarifying the ubiquity of exponential families and MaxEnt's role as the inevitable predictive limit under partial information.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[ChartGaze: Enhancing Chart Understanding in LVLMs with Eye-Tracking Guided Attention Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13282v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[OGF: An Online Gradient Flow Method for Optimizing the Statistical Steady-State Time Averages of Unsteady Turbulent Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05149v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x; \theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization, flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$. We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately recovers the optimal parameters.</p></details> | 34 pages, 13 figures |
| **[LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from 24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a 10-shot prompt](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13268v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used 24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male, mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better, with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden, text-based dietary monitoring tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/rodrigo-carrillo/LLMs-Macronutrient-Estimation-NHANES-Adolescents</p></details> |
| **[Real-time, Adaptive Radiological Anomaly Detection and Isotope Identification Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10715v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Post-Hoc Split-Point Self-Consistency Verification for Efficient, Unified Quantification of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13262v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs) on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities. Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ methods while incurring minimal overhead. Our source code is available at https://github.com/zzz0527/SPC-UQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures and 16 tables.

| **[Rebound: Efficient, Expressive, and Well-Scoped Binding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13261v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Rebound library that supports well-scoped term representations in Haskell and automates the definition of substitution, alpha-equivalence, and other operations that work with binding structures. The key idea of our design is the use of first-class environments that map variables to expressions in some new scope. By statically tracking scopes, users of this library gain confidence that they have correctly maintained the subtle invariants that stem from using de Bruijn indices. Behind the scenes, Rebound uses environments to optimize the application of substitutions, while providing explicit access to these data structures when desired. We demonstrate that this library is expressive by using it to implement a wide range of language features with sophisticated uses of binding and several different operations that use this abstract syntax. Our examples include pi-forall, a tutorial implementation of a type checker for a dependently-typed programming language. Finally, we benchmark Rebound to understand its performance characteristics and find that it produces faster code than competing libraries.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Evaluating LLM Alignment on Personality Inference from Real-World Interview Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13244v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents, counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19668v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME is pre-trained using structured diagnostic labels derived from ECG report entities through a one-time offline extraction with Large Language Models (LLMs), which help denoise, standardize cardiac concepts, and improve clinical representation learning. By fusing ECG signals with textual cardiac queries instead of fixed labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen conditions without further fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 106 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance of $77.20\%$, surpassing state-of-the-art eSSLs by $4.98\%$. Results demonstrate SuPreME's effectiveness in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of The 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Metacognitive Reuse: Turning Recurring LLM Reasoning Into Concise Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13237v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness, and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study, we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

This is especially evident in efforts to digitize historical Black newspapers, where inconsistent typography, visual degradation, and limited annotated layout data hinder accurate transcription, despite the availability of various systems that claim to handle optical character recognition (OCR) well. In this short paper, we present a layout-aware OCR pipeline tailored for Black newspaper archives and introduce an unsupervised evaluation framework suited to low-resource archival contexts. Our approach integrates synthetic layout generation, model pretraining on augmented data, and a fusion of state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) detectors. We used three annotation-free evaluation metrics, the Semantic Coherence Score (SCS), Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS), which quantify linguistic fluency, informational diversity, and redundancy across OCR regions. Our evaluation on a 400-page dataset from ten Black newspaper titles demonstrates that layout-aware OCR improves structural diversity and reduces redundancy compared to full-page baselines, with modest trade-offs in coherence. Our results highlight the importance of respecting cultural layout logic in AI-driven document understanding and lay the foundation for future community-driven and ethically grounded archival AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE-...</summary><p>IEEE-ISTAS conference</p></details> |
| **[Geometry, Energy and Sensitivity in Stochastic Proton Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13223v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop numerical schemes and sensitivity methods for stochastic models of proton transport that couple energy loss, range straggling and angular diffusion. For the energy equation we introduce a logarithmic Milstein scheme that guarantees positivity and achieves strong order one convergence. For the angular dynamics we construct a Lie-group integrator. The combined method maintains the natural geometric invariants of the system. We formulate dose deposition as a regularised path-dependent functional, obtaining a pathwise sensitivity estimator that is consistent and implementable. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed schemes achieve the expected convergence rates and provide stable estimates of dose sensitivities.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |
| **[On the Out-of-Distribution Backdoor Attack for Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13219v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL. To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$, which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce $\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL. Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at MobiHoc 2025</p></details> |

Thus, selecting suitable training sets from unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set, a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches. The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to produce an IIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents G-CSEA, a novel graph-based algorithm for rapidly diagnosing infeasibility in workforce scheduling models.

Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of symmetric tensors.</p></details> | 29 pages, 11 figures |
| **[OGF: An Online Gradient Flow Method for Optimizing the Statistical Steady-State Time Averages of Unsteady Turbulent Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05149v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x; \theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization, flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$. We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately recovers the optimal parameters.</p></details> | 34 pages, 13 figures |

In this context, the ability to detect and quantify subtle compression artifacts becomes critically important, as even slight degradations can impact perceptual quality in professional or quality sensitive applications, such as digital archiving, professional editing and web delivery. However, the performance of current objective image quality assessment metrics in this range has not been thoroughly investigated. In particular, it is not well understood how reliably these metrics estimate distortions at or below the threshold of Just Noticeable Difference (JND). This study directly addresses this issue by proposing evaluation methodologies for assessing the performance of objective quality metrics and performing a comprehensive evaluation using the JPEG AIC-3 dataset which is designed for high-fidelity image compression. Beyond conventional criteria, the study introduces Z-RMSE to incorporate subjective score uncertainty and applies novel statistical tests to assess significant differences between metrics. The analysis spans the full JPEG AIC-3 range and its high- and medium-fidelity subsets, examines the impact of cropping in subjective tests, and a public dataset with benchmarks and evaluation tools is released to support further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, Submitted to IEEE Access</p></details> |

These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute Recognition (TAR). Our novel data selection pipeline enhances context awareness, and our architecture employs a 2D RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding)-style mechanism to incorporate input context for more accurate attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual, multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDAR 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[The Belief State Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23506v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the "Belief State Transformer", a next-token predictor that takes both a prefix and suffix as inputs, with a novel objective of predicting both the next token for the prefix and the previous token for the suffix. The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.

| **[HiLAB: A Hybrid Inverse-Design Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17491v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs. Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters, produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude, accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green, and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust, multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation nanophotonic challenges.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO. Codes are available at \href{https://fredreic1849.github.io/BranchGRPO-Webpage/}{BranchGRPO}.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

We collected a dataset, called FF5, of five fake face image generators, including recent diffusion models. We find that a simple model trained on a specific image generator can achieve near-perfect accuracy in separating synthetic and real images. The model handles common image distortions (reduced resolution, compression) by using data augmentation. Moreover, partial manipulations, where synthetic images are blended into real ones by inpainting, are identified and the area of the manipulation is localized by a simple model of YOLO architecture. However, the model turned out to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and does not generalize to unseen generators. Failure to generalize to detect images produced by a newer generator also occurs for recent state-of-the-art methods, which we tested on Realistic Vision, a fine-tuned version of StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion image generator.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was presented at the DAGM German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR), 2025</p></details> |

We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop.

To this end, digital twins offer a valuable solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance -- up to 98\% AUROC, 96\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\% F1-score -- while providing interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To spur research in this area, we introduce the Speech Restoration Challenge as part of the China Computer Federation (CCF) Advanced Audio Technology Competition (AATC) 2025. This challenge focuses on restoring speech signals affected by a composite of three degradation types: (1) complex acoustic degradations including non-stationary noise and reverberation; (2) signal-chain artifacts such as those from MP3 compression; and (3) secondary artifacts introduced by other pre-processing enhancement models. We describe the challenge's background, the design of the task, the comprehensive dataset creation methodology, and the detailed evaluation protocol, which assesses both objective performance and model complexity.

In this paper, we introduce \textit{Content Concretization} (CC), a novel jailbreaking technique that iteratively transforms abstract malicious requests into concrete, executable implementations. CC is a two-stage process: first, generating initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models, then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350 cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\% after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal deployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual improved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in the Conference on Game Theory and AI for Security (GameSec) 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achiev-ing Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |

While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement. To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and improves the few-shot classification via transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), Rome, Italy 2025</p></details> |

Current AI models are opaque, centralized, and overly generic. The algorithmic automation they provide threatens human agency and democratic values in both workplaces and daily life. To confront such challenges, we turn to Scandinavian Participatory Design (PD), which was devised in the 1970s to face a similar threat from mechanical automation. In the PD tradition, technology is seen not just as an artifact, but as a locus of democracy. Drawing from this tradition, we propose Participatory AI as a PD approach to human-centered AI that applies five PD principles to four design challenges for algorithmic automation. We use concrete case studies to illustrate how to treat AI models less as proprietary products and more as shared socio-technical systems that enhance rather than diminish human agency, human dignity, and human values.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

To address this issue, we propose a novel multitask learning framework, Channel-Spatial Attention Synergy Network (CSASN), which integrates a dual-branch feature extractor - combining EfficientNet for local spatial encoding and ViT for global semantic modeling, with a cascaded channel-spatial attention refinement module. A residual multiscale classifier and dynamically weighted loss function further enhance classification stability and accuracy. Trained on a multicenter dataset comprising more than 2000 patients from four clinical institutions, our framework leverages a residual multiscale classifier and dynamically weighted loss function to enhance classification stability and accuracy. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that each module contributes significantly to model performance, particularly in recognizing rare subtypes such as FTC and MTC carcinomas. Experimental results show that CSASN outperforms existing single-stream CNN or Transformer-based models, achieving a superior balance between precision and recall under class-imbalanced conditions. This framework provides a promising strategy for AI-assisted thyroid cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Existing systems often suffer from representation mismatch in two-stage mel-vocoder pipelines and from over-smoothing of hallucinated high-band content by CNN-only generators. Diffusion and flow models are computationally expensive, and their robustness across domains and sampling rates remains limited. We propose SwinSRGAN, an end-to-end framework operating on Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) magnitudes. It is a Swin Transformer-based U-Net that captures long-range spectro-temporal dependencies with a hybrid adversarial scheme combines time-domain MPD/MSD discriminators with a multi-band MDCT discriminator specialized for the high-frequency band. We employs a sparse-aware regularizer on arcsinh-compressed MDCT to better preserve transient components. The system upsamples inputs at various sampling rates to 48 kHz in a single pass and operates in real time. On standard benchmarks, SwinSRGAN reduces objective error and improves ABX preference scores. In zero-shot tests on HiFi-TTS without fine-tuning, it outperforms NVSR and mdctGAN, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS) has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear relationship found for language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted for peer review</p></details> |

Benchmarking LLMs as Data Science Code Debuggers for Multi-Hop and Multi-Bug Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22388v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are transforming software development, yet current code generation and code repair benchmarks mainly assess syntactic and functional correctness in simple, single-error cases. LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future.

Current methods suffer from model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere" capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of 42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of the new paradigm.</p></details> | 14pages, 6 figures |
| **[Optimal Brain Restoration for Joint Quantization and Sparsification of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11177v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) compression, such as quantization and pruning, have achieved notable success. However, as these techniques gradually approach their respective limits, relying on a single method for further compression has become increasingly challenging. In this work, we explore an alternative solution by combining quantization and sparsity. This joint approach, though promising, introduces new difficulties due to the inherently conflicting requirements on weight distributions: quantization favors compact ranges, while pruning benefits from high variance. To attack this problem, we propose Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR), a general and training-free framework that aligns pruning and quantization by error compensation between both. OBR minimizes performance degradation on downstream tasks by building on a second-order Hessian objective, which is then reformulated into a tractable problem through surrogate approximation and ultimately reaches a closed-form solution via group error compensation. Experiments show that OBR enables aggressive W4A4KV4 quantization with 50% sparsity on existing LLMs, and delivers up to 4.72x speedup and 6.4x memory reduction compared to the FP16-dense baseline.</p></details> | Preprint |

SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://www.anjiecheng.me/sr3d</p></details> |

Because these records consist of distinct, segment-specific behaviours whose forms and scales vary over time, realistic inference demands a model that captures piecewise dynamics while accommodating parameters that are unknown a priori. Building on Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD), we introduce two complementary extensions: a particle-filter variant that substitutes exact marginalisation with sequential Monte Carlo to enable real-time inference when critical parameters cannot be integrated out analytically, and an online-gradient variant that embeds stochastic gradient updates within BOCPD to learn application-relevant parameters on the fly without prohibitive computational cost. After validating both algorithms on synthetic data that replicate the temporal structure of field observations-detailing hyperparameter choices, priors, and cost-saving strategies-we apply them to soil-moisture series from experimental sites in Austria and the United States, quantifying site-specific drydown rates and demonstrating the advantages of our adaptive framework over static models.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages of main manuscript and 3 pages if supplemental document</p></details> |

However, their ability to interpret human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and alignment-oriented fine-tuning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Evaluating Subjectivity in Narrative Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01132v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining faithfulness of a claim to a source document is an important problem across many domains. This task is generally treated as a binary judgment of whether the claim is supported or unsupported in relation to the source. In many cases, though, whether a claim is supported can be ambiguous. For instance, it may depend on making inferences from given evidence, and different people can reasonably interpret the claim as either supported or unsupported based on their agreement with those inferences. Forcing binary labels upon such claims lowers the reliability of evaluation. In this work, we reframe the task to manage the subjectivity involved with factuality judgments of ambiguous claims. We introduce LLM-generated edits of summaries as a method of providing a nuanced evaluation of claims: how much does a summary need to be edited to be unambiguous? Whether a claim gets rewritten and how much it changes can be used as an automatic evaluation metric, the Ambiguity Rewrite Metric (ARM), with a much richer feedback signal than a binary judgment of faithfulness. We focus on the area of narrative summarization as it is particularly rife with ambiguity and subjective interpretation. We show that ARM produces a 21% absolute improvement in annotator agreement on claim faithfulness, indicating that subjectivity is reduced.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |

During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

Traditional LLM applications inherently require huge static resource allocations, which force users to either wait in a long job queue and accept progress delay, or buy expensive hardware to fulfill their needs and exacerbate the demand-supply problem. However, not all LLM applications are latency-sensitive and can instead be executed in a throughput-oriented way. This throughput orientation allows a dynamic allocation that opportunistically pools available resources over time, avoiding both the long queue and expensive GPU purchases. Effectively utilizing opportunistic resources brings numerous challenges nevertheless. Our solution, pervasive context management, exploits the common computational context in LLM applications and provides mechanisms and policies that allow seamless context reuse on opportunistic resources. Our evaluation shows an LLM application with pervasive context management on opportunistic resources reduces its execution time by 98.1%.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We propose a method using implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring inference-time optimisation. Evaluated on 452 UK Biobank test cases, our method achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$ faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large CMR datasets.</p></details> | STACOM 2025 @ MICCAI |

This study benchmarks Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) against Granger causality, PCMCI, and VarLiNGAM using both synthetic datasets with ground truth causal links and 41 years of Arctic climate data (1979--2021). Unlike stochastic models that rely on autoregressive residual dependence, CCM leverages Takens' state-space reconstruction and delay-embedding to reconstruct attractor manifolds from time series. Cross mapping between reconstructed manifolds exploits deterministic signatures of causation, enabling the detection of weak and bidirectional causal links that linear models fail to resolve. Results demonstrate that CCM achieves higher specificity and fewer false positives on synthetic benchmarks, while maintaining robustness under observational noise and limited sample lengths. On Arctic data, CCM reveals significant causal interactions between sea ice extent and atmospheric variables like specific humidity, longwave radiation, and surface temperature with a $p$-value of $0.009$, supporting ice-albedo feedbacks and moisture-radiation couplings central to Arctic amplification. In contrast, stochastic approaches miss these nonlinear dependencies or infer spurious causal relations. This work establishes CCM as a robust causal inference tool for nonlinear climate dynamics and provides the first systematic benchmarking framework for method selection in climate research.</p></details> | <details><summary>In AC...</summary><p>In ACM Sigspatial Conference Workshop, 8 pages</p></details> |

Building on established results in robustness analysis, we hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy, specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, existing methods often suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling, resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.

We present a novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference. Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves 75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety, security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Prior work has shown that such inferences can lead to lower quality responses for users assumed to be from minority groups, even when no demographic information is explicitly provided. In this work, we systematically explore how LLMs respond to stereotypical cues using controlled synthetic conversations, by analyzing the models' latent user representations through both model internals and generated answers to targeted user questions. Our findings reveal that LLMs do infer demographic attributes based on these stereotypical signals, which for a number of groups even persists when the user explicitly identifies with a different demographic group. Finally, we show that this form of stereotype-driven implicit personalization can be effectively mitigated by intervening on the model's internal representations using a trained linear probe to steer them toward the explicitly stated identity. Our results highlight the need for greater transparency and control in how LLMs represent user identity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP Main 2025</p></details> |

Recent advancements, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, suggest that scaling up the length of CoT sequences during inference could further boost LLM reasoning performance. However, due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, longer CoT outputs lead to a linear increase in inference latency, adversely affecting user experience, particularly when the CoT exceeds 10,000 tokens. To address this limitation, we analyze the semantic importance of tokens within CoT outputs and reveal that their contributions to reasoning vary. Building on this insight, we propose TokenSkip, a simple yet effective approach that enables LLMs to selectively skip less important tokens, allowing for controllable CoT compression. Extensive experiments across various models and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenSkip in reducing CoT token usage while preserving strong reasoning performance. Notably, when applied to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, TokenSkip reduces reasoning tokens by 40% (from 313 to 181) on GSM8K, with less than a 0.4% performance drop. We release our code and checkpoints in https://github.com/hemingkx/TokenSkip.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Long Paper), camera-ready version</p></details> |

Comparison of k-anonymous Origin-Destination matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12950v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users' mobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These regions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without incurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the NetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot of socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD matrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is not merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a segment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in the anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to our contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for representativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual population, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in this work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey participants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional methods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas. These include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical Mondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a greedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality. Unlike previous approaches, which primarily address the privacy aspects of the given datasets, we aim to contribute to the generation of privacy-preserving OD matrices enriched with socio-demographic segmentation that achieves k-anonymity on the actual population.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NetMob 2025 Data Challenge (full report)</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but their deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1) the privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of local deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements imposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to meet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they overlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing requests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system. In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization method for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency emerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than parsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A Prefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of in-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and task-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the optimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads. The experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that InferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and markedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without compromising parsing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achiev-ing Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |

Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 8 figures, ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however, they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

| **[OneRec Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13695v4)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems have been widely used in various large-scale user-oriented platforms for many years. However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically by their first name</p></details> |

This study addresses the challenging problem of determining which robot should be assigned to which part of a task when each robot possesses different situational on-site knowledge-specifically, spatial concepts learned from the area designated to it by the user. We propose a task planning framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and spatial concepts to decompose natural language instructions into subtasks and allocate them to multiple robots. We designed a novel few-shot prompting strategy that enables LLMs to infer required objects from ambiguous commands and decompose them into appropriate subtasks. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved 47/50 successful assignments, outperforming random (28/50) and commonsense-based assignment (26/50). Furthermore, we conducted qualitative evaluations using two actual mobile manipulators. The results demonstrated that our framework could handle instructions, including those involving ad hoc categories such as "Get ready for a field trip," by successfully performing task decomposition, assignment, sequential planning, and execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AROB-ISBC 2026 (Journal Track option)</p></details> |

This article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Toward Ownership Understanding of Objects: Active Question Generation with Large Language Model and Probabilistic Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12754v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.'' However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AROB-ISBC 2026 (Journal Track option)</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Aware GPU Resource Allocation for Distributed LLM Inference via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10259v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of large language model (LLM) services imposes increasing demands on distributed GPU inference infrastructure. Most existing scheduling systems follow a reactive paradigm, relying solely on the current system state to make decisions, without considering how task demand and resource availability evolve over time. This lack of temporal awareness in reactive approaches leads to inefficient GPU utilization, high task migration overhead, and poor system responsiveness under dynamic workloads. In this work, we identify the fundamental limitations of these instantaneous-state-only scheduling approaches and propose Temporal Optimal Resource scheduling via Two-layer Architecture (TORTA). TORTA introduces a spatiotemporal scheduling framework that captures both long-term workload patterns and short-term execution constraints. It adopts a two-layer design: a macro-level scheduler leverages reinforcement learning and optimal transport to coordinate inter-region task distribution, while a micro-level allocator refines task-to-server assignments within each region to reduce latency and switching costs. Experimental results across multiple network topologies show that TORTA reduces average inference response time by up to 15\%, improves load balance by approximately 4-5\%, and cuts total operational cost by 10-20\% compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

The method uses a two stage curriculum: (1) a simple distance-visibility rule auto-labels a large dataset at low cost; and (2) a smaller set of high fidelity simulation trials refines the model to match true grasp outcomes. A PointNet++ style point cloud encoder with an MLP scores dense grids of candidate poses, enabling rapid online selection without full task-and-motion optimization. In simulation and on a real mobile manipulator, GBPP outperforms proximity and geometry only baselines, choosing safer and more reachable stances and degrading gracefully when wrong. The results offer a practical recipe for data efficient, geometry aware base placement: use inexpensive heuristics for coverage, then calibrate with targeted simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper needs major revision</p></details> |

However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem: fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence. Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA, where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks, Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models, highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient and accurate QA.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 16 tables, 5 figures.

However, underwater imagery is hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20 classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly. Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables secure processing of encrypted data, but the inherent computational complexity of FHE operations introduces significant computational overhead on the server side. FHE schemes often face a tradeoff between efficiency and versatility. While the CKKS scheme is highly efficient for polynomial operations, it lacks the flexibility of the binary TFHE (Torus-FHE) scheme, which offers greater versatility but at the cost of efficiency. The recent multi-bit TFHE extension offers greater flexibility and performance by supporting native non-polynomial operations and efficient integer processing. However, current implementations of multi-bit TFHE are constrained by its narrower numeric representation, which prevents its adoption in applications requiring wider numeric representations. To address this challenge, we introduce Taurus, a hardware accelerator designed to enhance the efficiency of multi-bit TFHE computations. Taurus supports ciphertexts up to 10 bits by leveraging novel FFT units and optimizing memory bandwidth through key reuse strategies. We also propose a compiler with operation deduplication to improve memory utilization. Our experiment results demonstrate that Taurus achieves up to 2600x speedup over a CPU, 1200x speedup over a GPU, and up to 7x faster compared to the previous state-of-the-art TFHE accelerator. Moreover, Taurus is the first accelerator to demonstrate privacy-preserving inference with large language models such as GPT-2. These advancements enable more practical and scalable applications of privacy-preserving computation in cloud environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |

Existing security paradigms face a critical bottleneck: efficiently identifying worst-case scenarios and rapidly coordinating defensive responses are hindered by intensive computation and time delays, during which cascading failures can propagate. This paper presents a novel tri-level robust constrained reinforcement learning (RCRL) framework for robust power system security. The framework generates diverse system states through AC-OPF formulations, identifies worst-case N-K attack scenarios for each state, and trains policies to mitigate these scenarios across all operating conditions without requiring predefined attack patterns. The framework addresses constraint satisfaction through Beta-blending projection-based feasible action mapping techniques during training and primal-dual augmented Lagrangian optimization for deployment. Once trained, the RCRL policy learns how to control observed cyber-physical attacks in real time. Validation on IEEE benchmark systems demonstrates effectiveness against coordinated N-K attacks, causing widespread cascading failures throughout the network. The learned policy can successfully respond rapidly to recover system-wide constraints back to normal within 0.21 ms inference times, establishing superior resilience for critical infrastructure protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, a major challenge lies in the labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic, dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague, incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy, robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025. 13 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

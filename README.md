| **[Vision Transformers with Self-Distilled Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21501v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for visual processing tasks, demonstrating excellent scalability with increased training data and model size. However, recent work has identified the emergence of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg), an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining. PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zju-real.github.io/ViewSpatial-Page/</p></details> |
| **[Paper2Poster: Towards Multimodal Poster Automation from Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21497v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models.

| **[UI-Genie: A Self-Improving Approach for Iteratively Boosting MLLM-based Mobile GUI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21496v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce UI-Genie, a self-improving framework addressing two key challenges in GUI agents: verification of trajectory outcome is challenging and high-quality training data are not scalable. These challenges are addressed by a reward model and a self-improving pipeline, respectively. The reward model, UI-Genie-RM, features an image-text interleaved architecture that efficiently pro- cesses historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards. To sup- port the training of UI-Genie-RM, we develop deliberately-designed data genera- tion strategies including rule-based verification, controlled trajectory corruption, and hard negative mining. To address the second challenge, a self-improvement pipeline progressively expands solvable complex GUI tasks by enhancing both the agent and reward models through reward-guided exploration and outcome verification in dynamic environments. For training the model, we generate UI- Genie-RM-517k and UI-Genie-Agent-16k, establishing the first reward-specific dataset for GUI agents while demonstrating high-quality synthetic trajectory gen- eration without manual annotation. Experimental results show that UI-Genie achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks with three generations of data-model self-improvement. We open-source our complete framework implementation and generated datasets to facilitate further research in https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Euphoria16/UI-Genie</p></details> |
| **[Be Decisive: Noise-Induced Layouts for Multi-Subject Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21488v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating multiple distinct subjects remains a challenge for existing text-to-image diffusion models. Complex prompts often lead to subject leakage, causing inaccuracies in quantities, attributes, and visual features. Preventing leakage among subjects necessitates knowledge of each subject's spatial location. Recent methods provide these spatial locations via an external layout control. However, enforcing such a prescribed layout often conflicts with the innate layout dictated by the sampled initial noise, leading to misalignment with the model's prior. In this work, we introduce a new approach that predicts a spatial layout aligned with the prompt, derived from the initial noise, and refines it throughout the denoising process. By relying on this noise-induced layout, we avoid conflicts with externally imposed layouts and better preserve the model's prior. Our method employs a small neural network to predict and refine the evolving noise-induced layout at each denoising step, ensuring clear boundaries between subjects while maintaining consistency. Experimental results show that this noise-aligned strategy achieves improved text-image alignment and more stable multi-subject generation compared to existing layout-guided techniques, while preserving the rich diversity of the model's original distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH 2025.

| **[Hardware-Efficient Attention for Fast Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21487v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM decoding is bottlenecked for large batches and long contexts by loading the key-value (KV) cache from high-bandwidth memory, which inflates per-token latency, while the sequential nature of decoding limits parallelism. We analyze the interplay among arithmetic intensity, parallelization, and model quality and question whether current architectures fully exploit modern hardware. This work redesigns attention to perform more computation per byte loaded from memory to maximize hardware efficiency without trading off parallel scalability. We first propose Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA), a simple variant that combines and reuses key and value states, reducing memory transfers without compromising model quality. We then introduce Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention paired with low-level optimizations for fast decoding while maintaining high model quality. Experiments show that GTA matches Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) quality while using roughly half the KV cache and that GLA matches Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and is easier to shard. Our optimized GLA kernel is up to 2$\times$ faster than FlashMLA, for example, in a speculative decoding setting when the query length exceeds one. Furthermore, by fetching a smaller KV cache per device, GLA reduces end-to-end latency and increases throughput in online serving benchmarks by up to 2$\times$.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, 45 tables</p></details> |
| **[Annealing Flow Generative Models Towards Sampling High-Dimensional and Multi-Modal Distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20547v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling from high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions remains a fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and physics-based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow (AF), a method built on Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF) for sampling from high-dimensional and multi-modal distributions. AF is trained with a dynamic Optimal Transport (OT) objective incorporating Wasserstein regularization, and guided by annealing procedures, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high-dimensional spaces. Compared to recent NF methods, AF greatly improves training efficiency and stability, with minimal reliance on MC assistance. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF compared to state-of-the-art methods through experiments on various challenging distributions and real-world datasets, particularly in high-dimensional and multi-modal settings. We also highlight AF potential for sampling the least favorable distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to ICML 2025 and will appear in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Scaling External Knowledge Input Beyond Context Windows of LLMs via Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21471v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of post-training techniques for reasoning and information seeking, large language models (LLMs) can incorporate a large quantity of retrieved knowledge to solve complex tasks. However, the limited context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework, $\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training. Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test, $\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input, regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$. Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input could benefit real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures.

| **[When Are Concepts Erased From Diffusion Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17013v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept erasure, the ability to selectively prevent a model from generating specific concepts, has attracted growing interest, with various approaches emerging to address the challenge. However, it remains unclear how thoroughly these methods erase the target concept. We begin by proposing two conceptual models for the erasure mechanism in diffusion models: (i) reducing the likelihood of generating the target concept, and (ii) interfering with the model's internal guidance mechanisms. To thoroughly assess whether a concept has been truly erased from the model, we introduce a suite of independent evaluations. Our evaluation framework includes adversarial attacks, novel probing techniques, and analysis of the model's alternative generations in place of the erased concept. Our results shed light on the tension between minimizing side effects and maintaining robustness to adversarial prompts. Broadly, our work underlines the importance of comprehensive evaluation for erasure in diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nyu-dice-lab.github.io/when-are-concepts-erased/</p></details> |
| **[Beyond 'Aha!': Toward Systematic Meta-Abilities Alignment in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10554v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's "aha moment". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental "aha moments". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional gain in performance ceiling for both 7B and 32B models across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

| **[GeLLMO: Generalizing Large Language Models for Multi-property Molecule Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13398v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advancements, most computational methods for molecule optimization are constrained to single- or double-property optimization tasks and suffer from poor scalability and generalizability to novel optimization tasks. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable out-of-domain generalizability to novel tasks. To demonstrate LLMs' potential for molecule optimization, we introduce MuMOInstruct, the first high-quality instruction-tuning dataset specifically focused on complex multi-property molecule optimization tasks. Leveraging MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMOs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs for molecule optimization. Extensive evaluations across 5 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain tasks demonstrate that GeLLMOs consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. GeLLMOs also exhibit outstanding zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, significantly outperforming powerful closed-source LLMs. Such strong generalizability demonstrates the tremendous potential of GeLLMOs as foundational models for molecule optimization, thereby tackling novel optimization tasks without resource-intensive retraining. MuMOInstruct, models, and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL Main 2025.

| **[LazyVLM: Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Video Analytics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21459v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video analytics approaches face a fundamental trade-off between flexibility and efficiency. End-to-end Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with long-context processing and incur high computational costs, while neural-symbolic methods depend heavily on manual labeling and rigid rule design. In this paper, we introduce LazyVLM, a neuro-symbolic video analytics system that provides a user-friendly query interface similar to VLMs, while addressing their scalability limitation. LazyVLM enables users to effortlessly drop in video data and specify complex multi-frame video queries using a semi-structured text interface for video analytics. To address the scalability limitations of VLMs, LazyVLM decomposes multi-frame video queries into fine-grained operations and offloads the bulk of the processing to efficient relational query execution and vector similarity search. We demonstrate that LazyVLM provides a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution for querying open-domain video data at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Working paper</p></details> |
| **[Active-O3: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Active Perception via GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21457v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active vision, also known as active perception, refers to the process of actively selecting where and how to look in order to gather task-relevant information. It is a critical component of efficient perception and decision-making in humans and advanced embodied agents. Recently, the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as central planning and decision-making modules in robotic systems has gained extensive attention. However, despite the importance of active perception in embodied intelligence, there is little to no exploration of how MLLMs can be equipped with or learn active perception capabilities. In this paper, we first provide a systematic definition of MLLM-based active perception tasks. We point out that the recently proposed GPT-o3 model's zoom-in search strategy can be regarded as a special case of active perception; however, it still suffers from low search efficiency and inaccurate region selection. To address these issues, we propose ACTIVE-O3, a purely reinforcement learning based training framework built on top of GRPO, designed to equip MLLMs with active perception capabilities. We further establish a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate ACTIVE-O3 across both general open-world tasks, such as small-object and dense object grounding, and domain-specific scenarios, including small object detection in remote sensing and autonomous driving, as well as fine-grained interactive segmentation. In addition, ACTIVE-O3 also demonstrates strong zero-shot reasoning abilities on the V* Benchmark, without relying on any explicit reasoning data. We hope that our work can provide a simple codebase and evaluation protocol to facilitate future research on active perception in MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aim-uofa.github.io/ACTIVE-o3</p></details> |

In this work, we aim to tackle this problem with Visual Product Graph (VPG), leveraging high-performance infrastructure for storage and state-of-the-art computer vision models for image understanding. VPG is built to be an online real-time retrieval system that enables navigation from individual products to composite scenes containing those products, along with complementary recommendations. Our system not only offers contextual insights by showcasing how products can be styled in a context, but also provides recommendations for complementary products drawn from these inspirations. We discuss the essential components for building the Visual Product Graph, along with the core computer vision model improvements across object detection, foundational visual embeddings, and other visual signals. Our system achieves a 78.8% extremely similar@1 in end-to-end human relevance evaluations, and a 6% module engagement rate. The "Ways to Style It" module, powered by the Visual Product Graph technology, is deployed in production at Pinterest.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

For example, cyclic peptides are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis compared to linear peptides and usually exhibit excellent stability and affinity. Although deep generative models have achieved great success in linear peptide design, several challenges prevent the development of computational methods for designing diverse types of cyclic peptides. These challenges include the scarcity of 3D structural data on target proteins and associated cyclic peptide ligands, the geometric constraints that cyclization imposes, and the involvement of non-canonical amino acids in cyclization. To address the above challenges, we introduce CpSDE, which consists of two key components: AtomSDE, a generative structure prediction model based on harmonic SDE, and ResRouter, a residue type predictor. Utilizing a routed sampling algorithm that alternates between these two models to iteratively update sequences and structures, CpSDE facilitates the generation of cyclic peptides. By employing explicit all-atom and bond modeling, CpSDE overcomes existing data limitations and is proficient in designing a wide variety of cyclic peptides. Our experimental results demonstrate that the cyclic peptides designed by our method exhibit reliable stability and affinity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Training neural control variates using correlated configurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07719v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[OmniSync: Towards Universal Lip Synchronization via Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21448v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/OmniSync/</p></details> |

| **[Can Large Reasoning Models Self-Train?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21444v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling the performance of large language models (LLMs) increasingly depends on methods that reduce reliance on human supervision. Reinforcement learning from automated verification offers an alternative, but it incurs scalability limitations due to dependency upon human-designed verifiers. Self-training, where the model's own judgment provides the supervisory signal, presents a compelling direction. We propose an online self-training reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the model's self-consistency to infer correctness signals and train without any ground-truth supervision. We apply the algorithm to challenging mathematical reasoning tasks and show that it quickly reaches performance levels rivaling reinforcement-learning methods trained explicitly on gold-standard answers. Additionally, we analyze inherent limitations of the algorithm, highlighting how the self-generated proxy reward initially correlated with correctness can incentivize reward hacking, where confidently incorrect outputs are favored. Our results illustrate how self-supervised improvement can achieve significant performance gains without external labels, while also revealing its fundamental challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://self-rewarding-llm-training.github.io/</p></details> |

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its considerable impact on improving text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral presentation at ICLR 2025.

Our strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization, split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings, including tabular, image, and genomic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 25 pages total. 5 figures main text, 9 figures total</p></details> |

We introduce InF-IR, a large-scale, high-quality training corpus tailored for enhancing retrieval models in Instruction-Following IR. InF-IR expands traditional training pairs into over 38,000 expressive <instruction, query, passage> triplets as positive samples. In particular, for each positive triplet, we generate two additional hard negative examples by poisoning both instructions and queries, then rigorously validated by an advanced reasoning model (o3-mini) to ensure semantic plausibility while maintaining instructional incorrectness. Unlike existing corpora that primarily support computationally intensive reranking tasks for decoder-only language models, the highly contrastive positive-negative triplets in InF-IR further enable efficient representation learning for smaller encoder-only models, facilitating direct embedding-based retrieval. Using this corpus, we train InF-Embed, an instruction-aware Embedding model optimized through contrastive learning and instruction-query attention mechanisms to align retrieval outcomes precisely with user intents. Extensive experiments across five instruction-based retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that InF-Embed significantly surpasses competitive baselines by 8.1% in p-MRR, measuring the instruction-following capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Retri...</summary><p>Retrieval Models, Embedding, Retrieval with Instructions</p></details> |
| **[CoDA: Coordinated Diffusion Noise Optimization for Whole-Body Manipulation of Articulated Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21437v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing whole-body manipulation of articulated objects, including body motion, hand motion, and object motion, is a critical yet challenging task with broad applications in virtual humans and robotics. The core challenges are twofold. First, achieving realistic whole-body motion requires tight coordination between the hands and the rest of the body, as their movements are interdependent during manipulation. Second, articulated object manipulation typically involves high degrees of freedom and demands higher precision, often requiring the fingers to be placed at specific regions to actuate movable parts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel coordinated diffusion noise optimization framework. Specifically, we perform noise-space optimization over three specialized diffusion models for the body, left hand, and right hand, each trained on its own motion dataset to improve generalization. Coordination naturally emerges through gradient flow along the human kinematic chain, allowing the global body posture to adapt in response to hand motion objectives with high fidelity. To further enhance precision in hand-object interaction, we adopt a unified representation based on basis point sets (BPS), where end-effector positions are encoded as distances to the same BPS used for object geometry. This unified representation captures fine-grained spatial relationships between the hand and articulated object parts, and the resulting trajectories serve as targets to guide the optimization of diffusion noise, producing highly accurate interaction motion. We conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches in motion quality and physical plausibility, and enables various capabilities such as object pose control, simultaneous walking and manipulation, and whole-body generation from hand-only data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://phj128.github.io/page/CoDA/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Scaling for Emergent Capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17356v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the nature of sudden breakthroughs in language model performance at scale, which stand in contrast to smooth improvements governed by scaling laws. While advocates of "emergence" view breakthroughs as unlocked capabilities, others attribute them to thresholding effects on noncontinuous metrics. We propose that breakthroughs are instead driven by continuous changes in the probability distribution of training outcomes when performance is bimodally distributed across random seeds. In synthetic length generalization tasks, we show that different random seeds can produce either highly linear or emergent scaling trends. We reveal that sharp breakthroughs in metrics are produced by underlying continuous changes in their distribution across seeds. Furthermore, we provide a case study of inverse scaling. We validate our distributional scaling framework on realistic settings by measuring MMLU performance in LM populations. These insights emphasize the role of random variation in the effect of scale on LM capabilities.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, as external components, CoT models are particularly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which existing defense mechanisms often fail to detect effectively. To address this challenge, we propose GUARD, a novel dual-agent defense framework specifically designed to counter CoT backdoor attacks in neural code generation. GUARD integrates two core components: GUARD-Judge, which identifies suspicious CoT steps and potential triggers through comprehensive analysis, and GUARD-Repair, which employs a retrieval-augmented generation approach to regenerate secure CoT steps for identified anomalies. Experimental results show that GUARD effectively mitigates attacks while maintaining generation quality, advancing secure code generation systems.</p></details> | under review |
| **[A Lightweight Method to Disrupt Memorized Sequences in LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05159v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As language models scale, their performance improves dramatically across a wide range of tasks, but so does their tendency to memorize and regurgitate parts of their training data verbatim. This tradeoff poses serious legal, ethical, and safety concerns, especially in real-world deployments. Existing mitigation techniques, such as differential privacy or model unlearning, often require retraining or access to internal weights making them impractical for most users. In this work, we introduce TokenSwap, a lightweight, post-hoc defense designed for realistic settings where the user can only access token-level outputs. Our key insight is that while large models are necessary for high task performance, small models (e.g., DistilGPT-2) are often sufficient to assign fluent, grammatically plausible probabilities to common function words - and crucially, they memorize far less. By selectively swapping token probabilities between models, TokenSwap preserves the capabilities of large models while reducing their propensity for verbatim reproduction. Evaluations on Pythia-6.9B and Llama-3-8B show up to a 10$\times$ drop in exact memorization with negligible task degradation. Our method offers a practical, accessible solution for mitigating memorized generation in deployed LLMs.</p></details> | 26 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08313v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight (v4: 47 pages, 26 figures, project page: https://sgp-bench.github.io/)</p></details> |

In the absence of predefined tools, prior works have explored instructing LLMs to generate tools on their own. However, such approaches rely heavily on the models' internal knowledge and would fail in domains beyond the LLMs' knowledge scope. To address this limitation, we propose RefTool, a reference-guided framework for automatic tool creation that leverages structured external materials such as textbooks. RefTool consists of two modules: (1) tool creation, where LLMs generate executable tools from reference content, validate them using illustrative examples, and organize them hierarchically into a toolbox; and (2) tool utilization, where LLMs navigate the toolbox structure to select and apply the appropriate tools to solve problems. Experiments on causality, physics, and chemistry benchmarks demonstrate that RefTool outperforms existing tool-creation and domain-specific reasoning methods by 11.3% on average accuracy, while being cost-efficient and broadly generalizable. Analyses reveal that grounding tool creation in references produces accurate and faithful tools, and that the hierarchical structure facilitates effective tool selection. RefTool enables LLMs to overcome knowledge limitations, demonstrating the value of grounding tool creation in external references for enhanced and generalizable reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/xxxiaol/RefTool</p></details> |

However, recent work has identified the emergence of artifact tokens in ViTs that are incongruous with the local semantics. These anomalous tokens degrade ViT performance in tasks that require fine-grained localization or structural coherence. An effective mitigation of this issue is to the addition of register tokens to ViTs, which implicitly "absorb" the artifact term during training. Given the availability of various large-scale pre-trained ViTs, in this paper we aim at equipping them with such register tokens without the need of re-training them from scratch, which is infeasible considering their size. Specifically, we propose Post Hoc Registers (PH-Reg), an efficient self-distillation method that integrates registers into an existing ViT without requiring additional labeled data and full retraining. PH-Reg initializes both teacher and student networks from the same pre-trained ViT. The teacher remains frozen and unmodified, while the student is augmented with randomly initialized register tokens. By applying test-time augmentation to the teacher's inputs, we generate denoised dense embeddings free of artifacts, which are then used to optimize only a small subset of unlocked student weights. We show that our approach can effectively reduce the number of artifact tokens, improving the segmentation and depth prediction of the student ViT under zero-shot and linear probing.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Paper2Poster: Towards Multimodal Poster Automation from Scientific Papers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21497v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on (i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably (iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated poster-generation models.

However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/OmniSync/</p></details> |
| **[Cryptography from Lossy Reductions: Towards OWFs from ETH, and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21442v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-way functions (OWFs) form the foundation of modern cryptography, yet their unconditional existence remains a major open question. In this work, we study this question by exploring its relation to lossy reductions, i.e., reductions~$R$ for which it holds that $I(X;R(X)) \ll n$ for all distributions~$X$ over inputs of size $n$. Our main result is that either OWFs exist or any lossy reduction for any promise problem~$\Pi$ runs in time~$2^{\Omega(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$, where $\tau_\Pi(n)$ is the infimum of the runtime of all (worst-case) solvers of~$\Pi$ on instances of size~$n$. In fact, our result requires a milder condition, that $R$ is lossy for sparse uniform distributions (which we call mild-lossiness). It also extends to $f$-reductions as long as $f$ is a non-constant permutation-invariant Boolean function, which includes And-, Or-, Maj-, Parity-, Modulo $k$, and Threshold $k$-reductions. Additionally, we show that worst-case to average-case Karp reductions and randomized encodings are special cases of mildly-lossy reductions and improve the runtime above as $2^{\Omega(\log \tau_\Pi)}$ when these mappings are considered. Restricting to weak fine-grained OWFs, this runtime can be further improved as~$\Omega(\tau_\Pi)$. Taking~$\Pi$ as~$kSAT$, our results provide sufficient conditions under which (fine-grained) OWFs exist assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Conversely, if (fine-grained) OWFs do not exist, we obtain impossibilities on instance compressions (Harnik and Naor, FOCS 2006) and instance randomizations of~$kSAT$ under the ETH. Finally, we partially extend these findings to the quantum setting; the existence of a pure quantum mildly-lossy reduction for $\Pi$ within the runtime~$2^{o(\log\tau_\Pi / \log\log n)}$ implies the existence of one-way state generators.</p></details> | 56 pages |

Popular sampling methods like top-p (nucleus sampling) often struggle to balance quality and diversity, especially at higher temperatures which lead to incoherent or repetitive outputs. We propose min-p sampling, a dynamic truncation method that adjusts the sampling threshold based on the model's confidence by using the top token's probability as a scaling factor. Our experiments on benchmarks including GPQA, GSM8K, and AlpacaEval Creative Writing show that min-p sampling improves both the quality and diversity of generated text across different model families (Mistral and Llama 3) and model sizes (1B to 123B parameters), especially at higher temperatures. Human evaluations further show a clear preference for min-p sampling, in both text quality and creativity. Min-p sampling has been adopted by popular open-source LLM frameworks, including Hugging Face Transformers, VLLM, and many others, highlighting its considerable impact on improving text generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral presentation at ICLR 2025.

Our strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization, split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings, including tabular, image, and genomic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 25 pages total. 5 figures main text, 9 figures total</p></details> |

Previous attempts to reduce foundation model size fall short of fully addressing the problem, as they end up increasing computational load through additional training steps. Recent works reveal that deep neural networks exhibit internal representation similarities. While inter-network similarities have enabled techniques such as model stitching and merging, intra-network similarities remain underexplored for improving efficiency. In this paper, we propose Transformer Blocks Approximation (TBA), a novel method that leverages intra-network similarities to identify and approximate transformer blocks in large vision models. TBA replaces these blocks using lightweight, closed-form transformations, without retraining or fine-tuning the rest of the model. The proposed method reduces the number of parameters while having minimal impact on the downstream task. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of TBA through extensive experiments across multiple datasets (e.g., Imagenet-1k and CIFAR100) and state-of-the-art pretrained vision models (e.g, ViT, DiNO-v2, and DEiT).</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 14 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

The PCFP addresses a fundamental question in morphological processing: how do speakers accurately generate inflected forms of words when presented with incomplete paradigms? This problem is particularly salient when modeling complex inflectional systems. We focus on Spanish verbal paradigms, where certain verbs follow an irregular L-shaped pattern, where the first-person singular present indicative stem matches the stem used throughout the present subjunctive mood. We formulate the problem as a morphological reinflection task. Specifically, we investigate the role of input frequency in the acquisition of regular versus irregular L-shaped patterns in transformer models. By systematically manipulating the input distributions and analyzing model behavior, we reveal four key findings: 1) Models perform better on L-shaped verbs compared to regular verbs, especially in uneven frequency conditions; 2) Robust primacy effects are observed, but no consistent recency effects; 3) Memorization becomes more prominent as the proportion of L-shaped verbs increases; 4) There is a tendency to regularize L-shaped verbs when their consonant alternation pairs are rare or absent in the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Typos...</summary><p>Typos and grammatical corrections</p></details> |

The algorithm enables each agent to update its local state estimate independently and engage in communication only when specific triggering conditions are satisfied, thereby significantly reducing communication overhead. At each iteration, agents project onto randomized subsets of local data blocks to lower computational cost and enhance scalability. From a theoretical standpoint, we establish exponential convergence conditions for the proposed algorithm. By defining events that ensure strong connectivity in the communication graph, we derive sufficient conditions for global convergence under a probabilistic framework. Our analysis guarantees that the algorithm is guaranteed to converge in expectation under mild probabilistic assumptions, provided that persistent agent isolation is avoided. For inconsistent systems, auxiliary variables are incorporated to transform the problem into an equivalent consistent formulation, and theoretical error bounds are derived. For practical evaluation, we implement the ER-AD-RBKP algorithm in an asynchronous communication environment built on ROS2, a distributed middleware framework for real-time robotic systems. We evaluate the algorithm under various settings, including varying numbers of agents, neighborhood sizes, communication intervals, and failure scenarios such as communication disruptions and processing faults. Experimental results demonstrate robust performance in terms of computational efficiency, communication cost, and system resilience, highlighting its strong potential for practical applicability in real-world distributed systems.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |

However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents a critical challenge for deployment in robust applications. This paper addresses the critical question of how to incorporate robustness into MoEs while maintaining high natural accuracy. We begin by analyzing the vulnerability of MoE components, finding that expert networks are notably more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the router. Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training technique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial robustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert without compromising training or inference efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a dual-model strategy that linearly combines a standard MoE model with our robustified MoE model using a smoothing parameter. This approach allows for flexible control over the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We further provide theoretical foundations by deriving certified robustness bounds for both the single MoE and the dual-model. To push the boundaries of robustness and accuracy, we propose a novel joint training strategy JTDMoE for the dual-model. This joint training enhances both robustness and accuracy beyond what is achievable with separate models. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Current benchmarks focus on simple knowledge retrieval, neglecting step-by-step reasoning required for complex tasks such as molecular optimization and reaction prediction. To address this, we introduce ChemCoTBench, a reasoning framework that bridges molecular structure understanding with arithmetic-inspired operations, including addition, deletion, and substitution, to formalize chemical problem-solving into transparent, step-by-step workflows. By treating molecular transformations as modular "chemical operations", the framework enables slow-thinking reasoning, mirroring the logic of mathematical proofs while grounding solutions in real-world chemical constraints. We evaluate models on two high-impact tasks: Molecular Property Optimization and Chemical Reaction Prediction. These tasks mirror real-world challenges while providing structured evaluability. By providing annotated datasets, a reasoning taxonomy, and baseline evaluations, ChemCoTBench bridges the gap between abstract reasoning methods and practical chemical discovery, establishing a foundation for advancing LLMs as tools for AI-driven scientific innovation.</p></details> | 22 pages, 10 figures |

These variables may cause false-positive feature attributions, undermining the utility of explanations. Although effective remedies exist for linear models, their extension to non-linear models and to instance-based explanations has remained limited. We introduce PatternLocal, a novel XAI technique that addresses this gap. PatternLocal begins with a locally linear surrogate, e.g. LIME, KernelSHAP, or gradient-based methods, and transforms the resulting discriminative model weights into a generative representation, thereby suppressing the influence of suppressor variables while preserving local fidelity. In extensive hyperparameter optimization on the XAI-TRIS benchmark, PatternLocal consistently outperformed other XAI methods and reduced false-positive attributions when explaining non-linear tasks, thereby enabling more reliable and actionable insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Our approach features a unique "small-to-large" design. A compact "seed" model containing a few Conformer or Transformer blocks is trained and unfolded many times to emulate the performance of larger uncompressed models with different logical depths. The seed model and many unfolded paths are jointly trained within a single unfolding cycle. The KL-divergence between the largest unfolded and smallest seed models is used in a self-distillation process to minimize their performance disparity. Experimental results show that our foldable model produces ASR performance comparable to individually constructed Conformer and wav2vec2/HuBERT speech foundation models under various depth configurations, while requiring only minimal memory and storage. Conformer and wav2vec2 models with a reduction of 35% and 30% parameters are obtained without loss of performance, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech2025</p></details> |

However, as pre-trained models grow in complexity, fully fine-tuning them for downstream applications demands substantial computational and storage resources. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer a promising solution to mitigate these resource requirements, yet most current approaches rely on complex adapter and prompt mechanisms that increase tunable parameters. In this paper, we propose PointLoRA, a simple yet effective method that combines low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with multi-scale token selection to efficiently fine-tune point cloud models. Our approach embeds LoRA layers within the most parameter-intensive components of point cloud transformers, reducing the need for tunable parameters while enhancing global feature capture. Additionally, multi-scale token selection extracts critical local information to serve as prompts for downstream fine-tuning, effectively complementing the global context captured by LoRA. The experimental results across various pre-trained models and three challenging public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance with only 3.43% of the trainable parameters, making it highly effective for resource-constrained applications.

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+4 p...</summary><p>9+4 pages, 8+5 figures</p></details> |

Conventional approaches in practice rely heavily on labor-intensive manual processes, limiting scalability and delaying the research workflow. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable method for accurately extracting quantitative insights from unstructured financial documents, leveraging a multi-agent system composed of large language models. Our proposed multi-agent system consists of two specialized agents: the \emph{Extraction Agent} and the \emph{Text-to-SQL Agent}. The \textit{Extraction Agent} automatically identifies key performance indicators from unstructured financial text, standardizes their formats, and verifies their accuracy. On the other hand, the \textit{Text-to-SQL Agent} generates executable SQL statements from natural language queries, allowing users to access structured data accurately without requiring familiarity with the database schema. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed system effectively transforms unstructured text into structured data accurately and enables precise retrieval of key information. First, we demonstrate that our system achieves approximately 95\% accuracy in transforming financial filings into structured data, matching the performance level typically attained by human annotators. Second, in a human evaluation of the retrieval task -- where natural language queries are used to search information from structured data -- 91\% of the responses were rated as correct by human evaluators. In both evaluations, our system generalizes well across financial document types, consistently delivering reliable performance.</p></details> | 7 pages, FinIR'25 |

AI capability evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior, societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually materializes when people use AI technology in context. Specifically, we describe the need for data and methods that can facilitate contextual awareness and enable downstream interpretation and decision making about AI's secondary effects, and recommend requirements for a new ecosystem.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, classical numerical algorithms scale unfavorably with respect to the dimensionality of such radiative transfer problems, where solutions depend on physical as well as angular variables. In this paper we address this dimensionality issue by developing a low-rank tensor product framework for the RTE in plane-parallel geometry. We exploit the tensor product nature of the phase space to recover an operator equation where the operator is given by a short sum of Kronecker products. This equation is solved by a preconditioned and rank-controlled Richardson iteration in Hilbert spaces. Using exponential sums approximations we construct a preconditioner that is compatible with the low-rank tensor product framework. The use of suitable preconditioning techniques yields a transformation of the operator equation in Hilbert space into a sequence space with Euclidean inner product, enabling rigorous error and rank control in the Euclidean metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 Figures, submitted to SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis</p></details> |

Parameter efficient fine tuning CL techniques are gaining traction for their effectiveness in addressing catastrophic forgetting with a lightweight training schedule while avoiding degradation of consolidated knowledge in pre-trained models. However, low rank adapters (LoRA) in these approaches are highly sensitive to rank selection which can lead to sub-optimal resource allocation and performance. To this end, we introduce PEARL, a rehearsal-free CL framework that entails dynamic rank allocation for LoRA components during CL training. Specifically, PEARL leverages reference task weights and adaptively determines the rank of task-specific LoRA components based on the current tasks' proximity to reference task weights in parameter space. To demonstrate the versatility of PEARL, we evaluate it across three vision architectures (ResNet, Separable Convolutional Network and Vision Transformer) and a multitude of CL scenarios, and show that PEARL outperforms all considered baselines by a large margin.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Dual Data Alignment Makes AI-Generated Image Detector Easier Generalizable](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14359v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 9 figures |

Thus Transformers often require post-training with a larger attention window, significantly increasing computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on dynamic context, Grouped Cross Attention (GCA), which can generalize to 1000 times the pre-training context length while maintaining the ability to access distant information with a constant attention window size. For a given input sequence, we split it into chunks and use each chunk to retrieve top-k relevant past chunks for subsequent text generation. Specifically, unlike most previous works that use an off-the-shelf retriever, our key innovation allows the retriever to learn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss of subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. Such a mechanism accommodates retrieved chunks with a fixed-size attention window to achieve long-range information access, significantly reducing computational and memory costs during training and inference. Experiments show that GCA-based models achieve near-perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval for 16M context lengths, which is 1000 times the training length.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

While existing surveys provide comprehensive overviews of MAS infrastructures, they largely overlook the dimension of \emph{creativity}, including how novel outputs are generated and evaluated, how creativity informs agent personas, and how creative workflows are coordinated. This is the first survey dedicated to creativity in MAS. We focus on text and image generation tasks, and present: (1) a taxonomy of agent proactivity and persona design; (2) an overview of generation techniques, including divergent exploration, iterative refinement, and collaborative synthesis, as well as relevant datasets and evaluation metrics; and (3) a discussion of key challenges, such as inconsistent evaluation standards, insufficient bias mitigation, coordination conflicts, and the lack of unified benchmarks.

| **[U-index: A Universal Indexing Framework for Matching Long Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14488v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text indexing is a fundamental and well-studied problem. Classic solutions either replace the original text with a compressed representation, e.g., the FM-index and its variants, or keep it uncompressed but attach some redundancy - an index - to accelerate matching. The former solutions thus retain excellent compressed space, but are slow in practice. The latter approaches, like the suffix array, instead sacrifice space for speed. We show that efficient text indexing can be achieved using just a small extra space on top of the original text, provided that the query patterns are sufficiently long. More specifically, we develop a new indexing paradigm in which a sketch of a query pattern is first matched against a sketch of the text. Once candidate matches are retrieved, they are verified using the original text. This paradigm is thus universal in the sense that it allows us to use any solution to index the sketched text, like a suffix array, FM-index, or r-index. We explore both the theory and the practice of this universal framework. With an extensive experimental analysis, we show that, surprisingly, universal indexes can be constructed much faster than their unsketched counterparts and take a fraction of the space, as a direct consequence of (i) having a lower bound on the length of patterns and (ii) working in sketch space. Furthermore, these data structures have the potential of retaining or even improving query time, because matching against the sketched text is faster and verifying candidates can be theoretically done in constant time per occurrence (or, in practice, by short and cache-friendly scans of the text). Finally, we discuss some important applications of this novel indexing paradigm to computational biology. We hypothesize that such indexes will be particularly effective when the queries are sufficiently long, and so demonstrate applications in long-read mapping.</p></details> | <details><summary>SEA-2...</summary><p>SEA-2025 version. 18 pages, 6 figures, code available at https://github.com/u-index/u-index-rs</p></details> |
| **[Minute-Long Videos with Dual Parallelisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21070v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based video diffusion models generate high-quality videos at scale but incur prohibitive processing latency and memory costs for long videos. To address this, we propose a novel distributed inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context, minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to 6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/DualParal-Project/DualParal</p></details> |

Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure like {verb,what,where/with}. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second step's where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments, leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb. Lastly, we propose iSRL-Qwen2-VL, which achieves a 17% relative improvement in F1-score for what-implicit and a 14.7% for where/with-implicit semantic roles over GPT-4o.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

Networks integrating stacked temporal and spectral modelling effectively leverage improved architectures such as transformers; however, they inevitably incur substantial computational complexity and model expansion. Through systematic ablation analysis on transformer-based temporal and spectral modelling, we demonstrate that the architecture employing streamlined Frequency-Time-Frequency (FTF) stacked transformers efficiently learns global dependencies within causal context, while avoiding considerable computational demands. Utilising discriminators in training further improves learning efficacy and enhancement without introducing additional complexity during inference. The proposed lightweight, causal, transformer-based architecture with adversarial training (LCT-GAN) yields SoTA performance on instrumental metrics among contemporary lightweight models, but with far less overhead. Compared to DeepFilterNet2, the LCT-GAN only requires 6% of the parameters, at similar complexity and performance. Against CCFNet+(Lite), LCT-GAN saves 9% in parameters and 10% in multiply-accumulate operations yet yielding improved performance. Further, the LCT-GAN even outperforms more complex, common baseline models on widely used test datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

However, discrepancies between simulation and real-world systems can lead to a significant drop in performance when models are applied in real scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a fault diagnosis framework based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), which enables knowledge transfer from simulated (source domain) to real-world (target domain) data. We evaluate the proposed framework using a publicly available robotics fault diagnosis dataset, which includes 3,600 sequences generated by a digital twin model and 90 real sequences collected from physical systems. The DANN method is compared with commonly used lightweight deep learning models such as CNN, TCN, Transformer, and LSTM. Experimental results show that incorporating domain adaptation significantly improves the diagnostic performance. For example, applying DANN to a baseline CNN model improves its accuracy from 70.00% to 80.22% on real-world test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain adaptation in bridging the sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted by ICCAD 2025 at Barcelona</p></details> |

We analyze the interplay among arithmetic intensity, parallelization, and model quality and question whether current architectures fully exploit modern hardware. This work redesigns attention to perform more computation per byte loaded from memory to maximize hardware efficiency without trading off parallel scalability. We first propose Grouped-Tied Attention (GTA), a simple variant that combines and reuses key and value states, reducing memory transfers without compromising model quality. We then introduce Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), a parallel-friendly latent attention paired with low-level optimizations for fast decoding while maintaining high model quality. Experiments show that GTA matches Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) quality while using roughly half the KV cache and that GLA matches Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and is easier to shard. Our optimized GLA kernel is up to 2$\times$ faster than FlashMLA, for example, in a speculative decoding setting when the query length exceeds one. Furthermore, by fetching a smaller KV cache per device, GLA reduces end-to-end latency and increases throughput in online serving benchmarks by up to 2$\times$.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, 45 tables</p></details> |

However, the limited context window of LLMs obstructs scaling the amount of external knowledge input, prohibiting further improvement, especially for tasks requiring significant amount of external knowledge. Existing context window extension methods inevitably cause information loss. LLM-based multi-agent methods emerge as a new paradigm to handle massive input in a distributional manner, where we identify two core bottlenecks in existing knowledge synchronization and reasoning processes. In this work, we develop a multi-agent framework, $\textbf{ExtAgents}$, to overcome the bottlenecks and enable better scalability in inference-time knowledge integration without longer-context training. Benchmarked with our enhanced multi-hop question answering test, $\textbf{$\boldsymbol{\infty}$Bench+}$, and other public test sets including long survey generation, ExtAgents significantly enhances the performance over existing non-training methods with the same amount of external knowledge input, regardless of whether it falls $\textit{within or exceeds the context window}$. Moreover, the method maintains high efficiency due to high parallelism. Further study in the coordination of LLM agents on increasing external knowledge input could benefit real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 9 figures.

However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://ziqiaopeng.github.io/OmniSync/</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning from automated verification offers an alternative, but it incurs scalability limitations due to dependency upon human-designed verifiers. Self-training, where the model's own judgment provides the supervisory signal, presents a compelling direction. We propose an online self-training reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the model's self-consistency to infer correctness signals and train without any ground-truth supervision. We apply the algorithm to challenging mathematical reasoning tasks and show that it quickly reaches performance levels rivaling reinforcement-learning methods trained explicitly on gold-standard answers. Additionally, we analyze inherent limitations of the algorithm, highlighting how the self-generated proxy reward initially correlated with correctness can incentivize reward hacking, where confidently incorrect outputs are favored. Our results illustrate how self-supervised improvement can achieve significant performance gains without external labels, while also revealing its fundamental challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://self-rewarding-llm-training.github.io/</p></details> |

However, current language models often lack the structured deliberation needed for such tasks, instead generating decisions and justifications in a disconnected, post-hoc manner. To address this, we propose DecisionFlow, a novel decision modeling framework that guides models to reason over structured representations of actions, attributes, and constraints. Rather than predicting answers directly from prompts, DecisionFlow builds a semantically grounded decision space and infers a latent utility function to evaluate trade-offs in a transparent, utility-driven manner. This process produces decisions tightly coupled with interpretable rationales reflecting the model's reasoning. Empirical results on two high-stakes benchmarks show that DecisionFlow not only achieves up to 30% accuracy gains over strong prompting baselines but also enhances alignment in outcomes. Our work is a critical step toward integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, enabling more accountable, explainable, and reliable LLM decision support systems.

For example, in air pollution epidemiology, modeled estimates for multiple air pollutants and meteorological factors may serve as surrogates for exposures and confounders. Methods for simultaneously addressing EME and CME remain understudied. We developed a two-stage causal effect modeling framework to estimate average exposure/treatment effects (AEE) by addressing EME and CME. We identified conditions under which AEE is identifiable with minimal bias given linear or non-linear potential outcomes models and developed a new method, referred to as multi-dimensional regression calibration (MRC). The first stage of the framework estimates MRC models. The second stage estimates AEE by using g-computation with MR-Calibrated variables. Simulation analyses confirmed the bias-correction capability. As an application, we analyzed the association between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in Cook County, Illinois. We developed machine learning-based 500m-gridded daily estimates of air pollutants and meteorological factors in a way for what we refer to as doubly EME&CME-correction. Using distributed lag variables, a one interquartile range (22.7ppb) increase in 3-week O3 exposure below 70ppb was associated with an 135.3% (95% CI: 68.4, 233.0) increase in COVID-19 mortality risk, comparable to that for PM2.5 exposure, which contradicts the previously reported no association for 3-week O3 in Cook County. At low levels, reducing pollution may have helped prevent premature deaths from COVID-19. Our new framework can address measurement error in multiple covariates simultaneously.</p></details> | Revisited/Revised |

The proposed scheme endows each agent with a gradient-based scheme equipped with a tracking mechanism to locally reconstruct the aggregative variable, which is not available to the agents. We show that our method falls into the framework of singularly perturbed systems, as it involves the interconnection between a fast subsystem - the global information reconstruction dynamics - with a slow one concerning the optimization of the local strategies. This perspective plays a key role in analyzing the scheme with a constant stepsize, and in proving its linear convergence to the Nash equilibrium in strongly monotone games with local constraints. By exploiting the flexibility of our aggregative variable definition (not necessarily the arithmetic average of the agents' strategy), we show the efficacy of our algorithm on a realistic voltage support case study for the smart grid.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 2024 IEEE 63rd Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), Milan, Italy.

| **[Optimizing Robustness and Accuracy in Mixture of Experts: A Dual-Model Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06832v3)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture of Experts (MoE) have shown remarkable success in leveraging specialized expert networks for complex machine learning tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents a critical challenge for deployment in robust applications. This paper addresses the critical question of how to incorporate robustness into MoEs while maintaining high natural accuracy. We begin by analyzing the vulnerability of MoE components, finding that expert networks are notably more susceptible to adversarial attacks than the router. Based on this insight, we propose a targeted robust training technique that integrates a novel loss function to enhance the adversarial robustness of MoE, requiring only the robustification of one additional expert without compromising training or inference efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a dual-model strategy that linearly combines a standard MoE model with our robustified MoE model using a smoothing parameter. This approach allows for flexible control over the robustness-accuracy trade-off. We further provide theoretical foundations by deriving certified robustness bounds for both the single MoE and the dual-model. To push the boundaries of robustness and accuracy, we propose a novel joint training strategy JTDMoE for the dual-model. This joint training enhances both robustness and accuracy beyond what is achievable with separate models. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNet18 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/TIML-Group/Robust-MoE-Dual-Model.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

In particular, we leverage the statistical finite elements (statFEM) formulation to obtain a finite-dimensional latent variable statistical model where the parameter is that of the (discretised) forward map and the latent variable is the statFEM solution of the PDE which is assumed to be partially observed. We then adapt a recently proposed expectation-maximisation like scheme, interacting particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), for this problem and obtain a joint estimation procedure for the parameters and the latent variables. We consider three main examples: (i) estimating the forcing for linear Poisson PDE, (ii) estimating diffusivity for linear Poisson PDE, and (iii) estimating the forcing for nonlinear Poisson PDE. We provide computational complexity estimates for forcing estimation in the linear case. We also provide comprehensive numerical experiments and preconditioning strategies that significantly improve the performance, showing that the proposed class of methods can be the choice for parameter inference in PDE models.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

Transcriptomics provides interpretable, gene-level insights, while microscopy imaging offers rich predictive features but is harder to interpret. Weakly paired datasets, where samples share biological states, enable multimodal learning but are scarce, limiting their utility for training and multimodal inference. We propose a framework to enhance transcriptomics by distilling knowledge from microscopy images. Using weakly paired data, our method aligns and binds modalities, enriching gene expression representations with morphological information. To address data scarcity, we introduce (1) Semi-Clipped, an adaptation of CLIP for cross-modal distillation using pretrained foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art results, and (2) PEA (Perturbation Embedding Augmentation), a novel augmentation technique that enhances transcriptomics data while preserving inherent biological information. These strategies improve the predictive power and retain the interpretability of transcriptomics, enabling rich unimodal representations for complex biological tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Fine-Tuning on Diverse Reasoning Chains Drives Within-Inference CoT Refinement in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03181v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requiring a large language model (LLM) to generate intermediary reasoning steps, known as Chain of Thought (CoT), has been shown to be an effective way of boosting performance. Previous approaches have focused on generating multiple independent CoTs, combining them through ensembling or other post-hoc strategies to enhance reasoning. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where LLMs are fine-tuned to generate a sequence of Diverse Chains of Thought (DCoT) within a single inference step, which is fundamentally different from prior work that primarily operate on parallel CoT generations. DCoT allows LLMs to gain the ability to perform within-inference refinement of reasoning chains without requiring external feedback. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B). These improvements are particularly impactful for tasks with a large result state space, such as those involving numeric answers. Our work is also significant because both quantitative analyses and manual evaluations reveal the observed gains stem from the models' ability to refine an initial reasoning chain by generating a second, improved chain within the same inference step, demonstrating previously elusive self-improvement. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/UKPLab/acl2025-diverse-cot.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode informative thinking without the information loss associated with autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling. Moreover, it shows strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques such as self-consistency. Source code is available at https://github.com/xuyige/SoftCoT.</p></details> | 14 pages |

This is closely related to Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE), which infers depth from a single image, as occlusion boundaries provide critical geometric cues for resolving depth ambiguities, while depth priors can conversely refine occlusion reasoning in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel network, MoDOT, that first jointly estimates depth and OBs. We propose CASM, a cross-attention multi-scale strip convolution module, leverages mid-level OB features to significantly enhance depth prediction. Additionally, we introduce an occlusion-aware loss function, OBDCL, which encourages sharper and more accurate depth boundaries. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the mutual benefits of jointly estimating depth and OB, and highlight the effectiveness of our model design. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on both our proposed synthetic datasets and one popular real dataset, NYUD-v2, significantly outperforming multi-task baselines. Besides, without domain adaptation, results on real-world depth transfer are comparable to the competitors, while preserving sharp occlusion boundaries for geometric fidelity. We will release our code, pre-trained models, and datasets to support future research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

However, SBI relies on machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning, combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+4 p...</summary><p>9+4 pages, 8+5 figures</p></details> |

While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods offer a more resource-conscious alternative, they typically requires retraining for each LLM backbone due to architectural dependencies. To address these challenges, here we propose Universal Reasoner (UniR) - a single, lightweight, composable, and plug-and-play reasoning module that can be used with any frozen LLM to endow it with specialized reasoning capabilities. Specifically, UniR decomposes the reward into a standalone reasoning module that is trained independently using predefined rewards, effectively translating trajectory-level signals into token-level guidance. Once trained, UniR can be combined with any frozen LLM at inference time by simply adding its output logits to those of the LLM backbone. This additive structure naturally enables modular composition: multiple UniR modules trained for different tasks can be jointly applied by summing their logits, enabling complex reasoning via composition. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks show that UniR significantly outperforms existing baseline fine-tuning methods using the Llama3.2 model. Furthermore, UniR demonstrates strong weak-to-strong generalization: reasoning modules trained on smaller models effectively guide much larger LLMs. This makes UniR a cost-efficient, adaptable, and robust solution for enhancing reasoning in LLMs without compromising their core capabilities.

Thus Transformers often require post-training with a larger attention window, significantly increasing computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on dynamic context, Grouped Cross Attention (GCA), which can generalize to 1000 times the pre-training context length while maintaining the ability to access distant information with a constant attention window size. For a given input sequence, we split it into chunks and use each chunk to retrieve top-k relevant past chunks for subsequent text generation. Specifically, unlike most previous works that use an off-the-shelf retriever, our key innovation allows the retriever to learn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss of subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. Such a mechanism accommodates retrieved chunks with a fixed-size attention window to achieve long-range information access, significantly reducing computational and memory costs during training and inference. Experiments show that GCA-based models achieve near-perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval for 16M context lengths, which is 1000 times the training length.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to ICML 2025</p></details> |

Quantization can mitigate these costs, but may degrade performance. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of quantized LLMs on tasks with long-inputs (>64K tokens) and long-form outputs. Our evaluation spans 9.7K test examples, five quantization methods (FP8, GPTQ-int8, AWQ-int4, GPTQ-int4, BNB-nf4), and five models (Llama-3.1 8B and 70B; Qwen-2.5 7B, 32B, and 72B). We find that, on average, 8-bit quantization preserves accuracy (~0.8% drop), whereas 4-bit methods lead to substantial losses, especially for tasks involving long context inputs (drops of up to 59%). This degradation tends to worsen when the input is in a language other than English. Crucially, the effects of quantization depend heavily on the quantization method, model, and task. For instance, while Qwen-2.5 72B remains robust under BNB-nf4, Llama-3.1 70B experiences a 32% performance drop on the same task. These findings highlight the importance of a careful, task-specific evaluation before deploying quantized LLMs, particularly in long-context scenarios and with languages other than English.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of content with 9 figures. 37 remaining pages of references and supplementary with 17 figures.

Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers, heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver. Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256 with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of 2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional solvers by a significant margin. Moreover, our searched solver demonstrates generality across various model architectures, resolutions, and model sizes.</p></details> | accpeted on ICML25 |
| **[A Lightweight Multi-Expert Generative Language Model System for Engineering Information and Knowledge Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21109v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advancements in domain adaptation techniques for large language models, these methods remain computationally intensive, and the resulting models can still exhibit hallucination issues. Most existing adaptation methods do not prioritize reducing the computational resources required for fine-tuning and inference of language models. Hallucination issues have gradually decreased with each new model release. However, they remain prevalent in engineering contexts, where generating well-structured text with minimal errors and inconsistencies is critical. This work introduces a novel approach called the Small Language Graph (SLG), which is a lightweight adaptation solution designed to address the two key challenges outlined above. The system is structured in the form of a graph, where each node represents a lightweight expert - a small language model fine-tuned on specific and concise texts. The results of this study have shown that SLG was able to surpass conventional fine-tuning methods on the Exact Match metric by 3 times. Additionally, the fine-tuning process was 1.7 times faster compared to that of a larger stand-alone language model. These findings introduce a potential for small to medium-sized engineering companies to confidently use generative AI technologies, such as LLMs, without the necessity to invest in expensive computational resources. Also, the graph architecture and the small size of expert nodes offer a possible opportunity for distributed AI systems, thus potentially diverting the global need for expensive centralized compute clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 Figures, 6 Tables.

This work presents a (minimal) perfect hash function that first prioritizes query throughput, while also allowing efficient construction for $10^9$ or more elements using 2.4 bits of memory per key. Both PTHash and PHOBIC first map all $n$ keys to $n/\lambda < n$ buckets. Then, each bucket stores a pilot that controls the final hash value of the keys mapping to it. PtrHash builds on this by using 1) fixed-width (uncompressed) 8-bit pilots, 2) a construction algorithm similar to cuckoo-hashing to find suitable pilot values. Further, it 3) uses the same number of buckets and slots for each part, with 4) a single remap table to map intermediate positions $\geq n$ to $<n$, 5) encoded using per-cacheline Elias-Fano coding. Lastly, 6) PtrHash support streaming queries, where we use prefetching to answer a stream of multiple queries more efficiently than one-by-one processing. With default parameters, PtrHash takes 2.0 bits per key. On 300 million string keys, PtrHash is as fast or faster to build than other MPHFs, and at least $2.1\times$ faster to query. When streaming multiple queries, this improves to $3.3\times$ speedup over the fastest alternative, while also being significantly faster to construct. When using $10^9$ integer keys instead, query times are as low as 12 ns/key when iterating in a for loop, or even down to 8 ns/key when using the streaming approach, just short of the 7.4 ns inverse throughput of random memory accesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>SEA-2...</summary><p>SEA-2025 version. 21 pages; 7 figures; source code at https://github.com/RagnarGrootKoerkamp/ptrhash</p></details> |
| **[Thinker: Learning to Think Fast and Slow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21097v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 24.9% to 27.9% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 49.8% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 26.8% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training.</p></details> | 21 pages |

To provide an approximate conjugacy in the model, the likelihood is approximated by a quadratic function, which provides the conjugacy of the approximation component with the Gaussian prior on the regression coefficient. Three sparsity-enforcing priors are used for this problem. The proposed models are compared with each other and two frequentist sparse Poisson methods (LASSO and SCAD) to evaluate the estimation, prediction, and sparsity performance of the proposed methods. Throughout a simulated data example, the accuracy of the VB methods is computed compared to the corresponding benchmark MCMC methods. It can be observed that the proposed VB methods have provided a good approximation to the posterior distribution of the parameters, while the VB methods are much faster than the MCMC ones. Using several benchmark count response data sets, the prediction performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>A par...</summary><p>A part of the PhD thesis of Miss Mitra Kharabati</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel distributed inference strategy, termed DualParal. The core idea is that, instead of generating an entire video on a single GPU, we parallelize both temporal frames and model layers across GPUs. However, a naive implementation of this division faces a key limitation: since diffusion models require synchronized noise levels across frames, this implementation leads to the serialization of original parallelisms. We leverage a block-wise denoising scheme to handle this. Namely, we process a sequence of frame blocks through the pipeline with progressively decreasing noise levels. Each GPU handles a specific block and layer subset while passing previous results to the next GPU, enabling asynchronous computation and communication. To further optimize performance, we incorporate two key enhancements. Firstly, a feature cache is implemented on each GPU to store and reuse features from the prior block as context, minimizing inter-GPU communication and redundant computation. Secondly, we employ a coordinated noise initialization strategy, ensuring globally consistent temporal dynamics by sharing initial noise patterns across GPUs without extra resource costs. Together, these enable fast, artifact-free, and infinitely long video generation. Applied to the latest diffusion transformer video generator, our method efficiently produces 1,025-frame videos with up to 6.54$\times$ lower latency and 1.48$\times$ lower memory cost on 8$\times$RTX 4090 GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/DualParal-Project/DualParal</p></details> |

Transforming these into Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) improves understanding of individual steps by identifying predicate-argument structure like {verb,what,where/with}. Procedural instructions are highly elliptic, for instance, (i) add cucumber to the bowl and (ii) add sliced tomatoes, the second step's where argument is inferred from the context, referring to where the cucumber was placed. Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments, leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb. Lastly, we propose iSRL-Qwen2-VL, which achieves a 17% relative improvement in F1-score for what-implicit and a 14.7% for where/with-implicit semantic roles over GPT-4o.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

Networks integrating stacked temporal and spectral modelling effectively leverage improved architectures such as transformers; however, they inevitably incur substantial computational complexity and model expansion. Through systematic ablation analysis on transformer-based temporal and spectral modelling, we demonstrate that the architecture employing streamlined Frequency-Time-Frequency (FTF) stacked transformers efficiently learns global dependencies within causal context, while avoiding considerable computational demands. Utilising discriminators in training further improves learning efficacy and enhancement without introducing additional complexity during inference. The proposed lightweight, causal, transformer-based architecture with adversarial training (LCT-GAN) yields SoTA performance on instrumental metrics among contemporary lightweight models, but with far less overhead. Compared to DeepFilterNet2, the LCT-GAN only requires 6% of the parameters, at similar complexity and performance.

Test-time alignment techniques that do not modify the underlying models, such as prompting and guided decodings, offer a lightweight alternative. However, existing test-time alignment methods primarily improve short responses and fail to ensure coherence over extended contexts due to the myopic nature of token-level alignment. Moreover, these methods often incur a slowdown during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Plan2Align, a test-time alignment framework that formulates text generation as a predictive planning problem. Plan2Align adapts Model Predictive Control (MPC) to iteratively refine output by rolling out multiple complete responses and optimizing each segment. To more rigorously evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency, we focus on the more challenging task of long-text generation. Experiments on the long-form response subset of the HH-RLHF dataset and the WMT'24 Discourse-Level Literary Translation demonstrate that Plan2Align significantly enhances the performance of base LLMs. Compared to existing training-time and test-time alignment methods on LLaMA-3.1 8B, Plan2Align achieves comparable or superior results, while also delivering improved inference efficiency relative to prior test-time alignment approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this work, we conduct a series of experiments to investigate what LLMs actually learn during fine-tuning. We begin by analyzing predicate frequencies in premises and hypotheses across NLI datasets and identify a consistent frequency bias, where predicates in hypotheses occur more frequently than those in premises for positive instances. To assess the impact of this bias, we evaluate both standard and NLI fine-tuned LLMs on bias-consistent and bias-adversarial cases. We find that LLMs exploit frequency bias for inference and perform poorly on adversarial instances. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLMs exhibit significantly increased reliance on this bias, suggesting that they are learning these frequency patterns from datasets. Finally, we compute the frequencies of hyponyms and their corresponding hypernyms from WordNet, revealing a correlation between frequency bias and textual entailment. These findings help explain why learning frequency patterns can enhance model performance on inference tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[RvLLM: LLM Runtime Verification with Domain Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18585v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a dominant AI paradigm due to their exceptional text understanding and generation capabilities. However, their tendency to generate inconsistent or erroneous outputs challenges their reliability, especially in high-stakes domains requiring accuracy and trustworthiness. Existing research primarily focuses on detecting and mitigating model misbehavior in general-purpose scenarios, often overlooking the potential of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this work, we advance misbehavior detection by incorporating domain knowledge. The core idea is to design a general specification language that enables domain experts to customize domain-specific predicates in a lightweight and intuitive manner, supporting later runtime verification of LLM outputs. To achieve this, we design a novel specification language, ESL, and introduce a runtime verification framework, RvLLM, to validate LLM output against domain-specific constraints defined in ESL. We evaluate RvLLM on three representative tasks: violation detection against Singapore Rapid Transit Systems Act, numerical comparison, and inequality solving. Experimental results demonstrate that RvLLM effectively detects erroneous outputs across various LLMs in a lightweight and flexible manner. The results reveal that despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs remain prone to low-level errors due to limited interpretability and a lack of formal guarantees during inference, and our framework offers a potential long-term solution by leveraging expert domain knowledge to rigorously and efficiently verify LLM outputs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Personalized Query Auto-Completion for Long and Short-Term Interests with Adaptive Detoxification Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20966v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Query auto-completion (QAC) plays a crucial role in modern search systems. However, in real-world applications, there are two pressing challenges that still need to be addressed. First, there is a need for hierarchical personalized representations for users. Previous approaches have typically used users' search behavior as a single, overall representation, which proves inadequate in more nuanced generative scenarios. Additionally, query prefixes are typically short and may contain typos or sensitive information, increasing the likelihood of generating toxic content compared to traditional text generation tasks. Such toxic content can degrade user experience and lead to public relations issues. Therefore, the second critical challenge is detoxifying QAC systems. To address these two limitations, we propose a novel model (LaD) that captures personalized information from both long-term and short-term interests, incorporating adaptive detoxification. In LaD, personalized information is captured hierarchically at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. This approach preserves as much personalized information as possible while enabling online generation within time constraints. To move a futher step, we propose an online training method based on Reject Preference Optimization (RPO). By incorporating a special token [Reject] during both the training and inference processes, the model achieves adaptive detoxification. Consequently, the generated text presented to users is both non-toxic and relevant to the given prefix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets and perform online A/B tests, delivering the largest single-experiment metric improvement in nearly two years of our product. Our model has been deployed on Kuaishou search, driving the primary traffic for hundreds of millions of active users. The code is available at https://github.com/JXZe/LaD.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |
| **[Resampling Filter Design for Multirate Neural Audio Effect Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18470v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have become ubiquitous in audio effects modelling, especially for guitar amplifiers and distortion pedals. One limitation of such models is that the sample rate of the training data is implicitly encoded in the model weights and therefore not readily adjustable at inference. Recent work explored modifications to recurrent neural network architecture to approximate a sample rate independent system, enabling audio processing at a rate that differs from the original training rate. This method works well for integer oversampling and can reduce aliasing caused by nonlinear activation functions. For small fractional changes in sample rate, fractional delay filters can be used to approximate sample rate independence, but in some cases this method fails entirely. Here, we explore the use of real-time signal resampling at the input and output of the neural network as an alternative solution. We investigate several resampling filter designs and show that a two-stage design consisting of a half-band IIR filter cascaded with a Kaiser window FIR filter can give similar or better results to the previously proposed model adjustment method with many fewer filtering operations per sample and less than one millisecond of latency at typical audio rates. Furthermore, we investigate interpolation and decimation filters for the task of integer oversampling and show that cascaded half-band IIR and FIR designs can be used in conjunction with the model adjustment method to reduce aliasing in a range of distortion effect models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |
| **[Two Experts Are All You Need for Steering Thinking: Reinforcing Cognitive Effort in MoE Reasoning Models Without Additional Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14681v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances, existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts (RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by tokens like ''<think>''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.</p></details> | Work in progress |

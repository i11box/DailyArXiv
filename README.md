| **[ACCORD: Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design for 5G/NextG Machine-centric Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20320v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in AI and edge computing have accelerated the development of machine-centric applications (MCAs), such as smart surveillance systems. In these applications, video cameras and sensors offload inference tasks like license plate recognition and vehicle tracking to remote servers due to local computing and energy constraints. However, legacy network solutions, designed primarily for human-centric applications, struggle to reliably support these MCAs, which demand heterogeneous and fluctuating QoS (due to diverse application inference tasks), further challenged by dynamic wireless network conditions and limited spectrum resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design (ACCORD) framework. This innovative framework anticipates the evolving demands of MCAs in real time, quickly adapting to provide customized QoS and optimal performance, even for the most dynamic and unpredictable MCAs. This also leads to improved network resource management and spectrum utilization. ACCORD operates as a closed feedback-loop system between the application client and network and consists of two key components: (1) Building Application Context: It focuses on understanding the specific context of MCA requirements. Contextual factors include device capabilities, user behavior (e.g., mobility speed), and network channel conditions. (2) Cross-layer Network Parameter Configuration: Utilizing a DRL approach, this component leverages the contextual information to optimize network configuration parameters across various layers, including PHY, MAC, and RLC, as well as the application layer, to meet the desired QoS requirement in real-time. Extensive evaluation with the 3GPP-compliant MATLAB 5G toolbox demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed ACCORD framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications at ICC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Attention Distillation: A Unified Approach to Visual Characteristics Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20235v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative diffusion models have shown a notable inherent understanding of image style and semantics. In this paper, we leverage the self-attention features from pretrained diffusion networks to transfer the visual characteristics from a reference to generated images. Unlike previous work that uses these features as plug-and-play attributes, we propose a novel attention distillation loss calculated between the ideal and current stylization results, based on which we optimize the synthesized image via backpropagation in latent space. Next, we propose an improved Classifier Guidance that integrates attention distillation loss into the denoising sampling process, further accelerating the synthesis and enabling a broad range of image generation applications. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the extraordinary performance of our approach in transferring the examples' style, appearance, and texture to new images in synthesis.

| **[Preconditioned Score-based Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06504v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models. However, a fundamental limitation is that their sampling process is slow due to a need for many (e.g., 2000) iterations of sequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the sampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We assault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and reverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a novel preconditioned diffusion sampling (PDS) method that leverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS alters the sampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation cost and without model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves the output distribution of the SGM, with no risk of inducing systematical bias to the original sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation between the parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations, easing the parameter estimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various image datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our PDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the synthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to 28x on more challenging high-resolution (1024x1024) image generation. Compared with the latest generative models (e.g., CLD-SGM and Analytic-DDIM), PDS can achieve the best sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at an FID score of 1.99. Our code is publicly available to foster any further research https://github.com/fudan-zvg/PDS.</p></details> | IJCV 2025 |
| **[AgentSquare: Automatic LLM Agent Search in Modular Design Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06153v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a rapid growth of agentic systems capable of handling a wide range of complex tasks. However, current research largely relies on manual, task-specific design, limiting their adaptability to novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new research problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular design space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental modules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory. Building on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework called AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module evolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To further accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses in-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web, embodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially outperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2% against best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate interpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic architecture and its impact on task performance. We believe that the modular design space and AgentSquare search framework offer a platform for fully exploiting the potential of prior successful designs and consolidating the collective efforts of research community.

| **[A Novel P-bit-based Probabilistic Computing Approach for Solving the 3-D Protein Folding Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20050v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the post-Moore era, the need for efficient solutions to non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) problems is becoming more pressing. In this context, the Ising model implemented by the probabilistic computing systems with probabilistic bits (p-bits) has attracted attention due to the widespread availability of p-bits and support for large-scale simulations. This study marks the first work to apply probabilistic computing to tackle protein folding, a significant NP-complete problem challenge in biology. We represent proteins as sequences of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) beads within a three-dimensional (3-D) grid and introduce a novel many-body interaction-based encoding method to map the problem onto an Ising model. Our simulations show that this approach significantly simplifies the energy landscape for short peptide sequences of six amino acids, halving the number of energy levels. Furthermore, the proposed mapping method achieves approximately 100 times acceleration for sequences consisting of ten amino acids in identifying the correct folding configuration. We predicted the optimal folding configuration for a peptide sequence of 36 amino acids by identifying the ground state. These findings highlight the unique potential of the proposed encoding method for solving protein folding and, importantly, provide new tools for solving similar NP-complete problems in biology by probabilistic computing approach.</p></details> | 14pages, 6 fingures |
| **[Large-Scale Simulations of Fully Resolved Complex Moving Geometries with Partially Saturated Cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20049v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We employ the Partially Saturated Cells Method (PSM) to model the interaction between the fluid flow and solid moving objects as an extension to the conventional lattice Boltzmann method. We introduce an efficient and accurate method for mapping complex moving geometries onto uniform Cartesian grids suitable for massively parallel processing. A validation of the physical accuracy of the solid-fluid coupling and the proposed mapping of complex geometries ispresented. The implementation is integrated into the code generation pipeline of the waLBerla framework so that highly optimized kernels for CPU and GPU architectures become available. We study the node-level performance of the automatically generated solver routines. 71% of the peak performance can be achieved on CPU nodes and 86% on GPU accelerated nodes. Only a moderate overhead is observed for the processing of the solid-fluid coupling when compared to the fluids simulations without moving objects. Finally, a counter-rotating rotor is presented as a prototype industrial scenario, resulting in a mesh size involving up to 4.3 billion fluid grid cells. For this scenario, excellent parallel efficiency is reported in a strong scaling study on up to 32,768 CPU cores on the LUMI-C supercomputer and on up to 1,024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on the JUWELS Booster system.</p></details> | 13 pages, 16 figures |
| **[AirSLAM: An Efficient and Illumination-Robust Point-Line Visual SLAM System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03520v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an efficient visual SLAM system designed to tackle both short-term and long-term illumination challenges. Our system adopts a hybrid approach that combines deep learning techniques for feature detection and matching with traditional backend optimization methods. Specifically, we propose a unified convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously extracts keypoints and structural lines. These features are then associated, matched, triangulated, and optimized in a coupled manner. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight relocalization pipeline that reuses the built map, where keypoints, lines, and a structure graph are used to match the query frame with the map. To enhance the applicability of the proposed system to real-world robots, we deploy and accelerate the feature detection and matching networks using C++ and NVIDIA TensorRT. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that our system outperforms other state-of-the-art visual SLAM systems in illumination-challenging environments. Efficiency evaluations show that our system can run at a rate of 73Hz on a PC and 40Hz on an embedded platform. Our implementation is open-sourced: https://github.com/sair-lab/AirSLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[ProtoOcc: Accurate, Efficient 3D Occupancy Prediction Using Dual Branch Encoder-Prototype Query Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08774v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce ProtoOcc, a novel 3D occupancy prediction model designed to predict the occupancy states and semantic classes of 3D voxels through a deep semantic understanding of scenes. ProtoOcc consists of two main components: the Dual Branch Encoder (DBE) and the Prototype Query Decoder (PQD). The DBE produces a new 3D voxel representation by combining 3D voxel and BEV representations across multiple scales through a dual branch structure. This design enhances both performance and computational efficiency by providing a large receptive field for the BEV representation while maintaining a smaller receptive field for the voxel representation. The PQD introduces Prototype Queries to accelerate the decoding process. Scene-Adaptive Prototypes are derived from the 3D voxel features of input sample, while Scene-Agnostic Prototypes are computed by applying Scene-Adaptive Prototypes to an Exponential Moving Average during the training phase. By using these prototype-based queries for decoding, we can directly predict 3D occupancy in a single step, eliminating the need for iterative Transformer decoding. Additionally, we propose the Robust Prototype Learning, which injects noise into prototype generation process and trains the model to denoise during the training phase. ProtoOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance with 45.02% mIoU on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark. For single-frame method, it reaches 39.56% mIoU with an inference speed of 12.83 FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 3090. Our code can be found at https://github.com/SPA-junghokim/ProtoOcc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2025, 15 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[PyramidDrop: Accelerating Your Large Vision-Language Models via Pyramid Visual Redundancy Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17247v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large vision-language models (LVLMs), images serve as inputs that carry a wealth of information. As the idiom "A picture is worth a thousand words" implies, representing a single image in current LVLMs can require hundreds or even thousands of tokens. This results in significant computational costs, which grow quadratically as input image resolution increases, thereby severely impacting the efficiency of both training and inference. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens either before or within the early layers of LVLMs. However, these strategies inevitably result in the loss of crucial image information, ultimately diminishing model performance. To address this challenge, we conduct an empirical study revealing that all visual tokens are necessary for LVLMs in the shallow layers, and token redundancy progressively increases in the deeper layers of the model. To this end, we propose PyramidDrop, a visual redundancy reduction strategy for LVLMs to boost their efficiency in both training and inference with neglectable performance loss. Specifically, we partition the LVLM into several stages and drop part of the image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio, creating pyramid-like visual tokens across model layers. The dropping is based on a lightweight similarity calculation with a negligible time overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PyramidDrop can achieve a 40% training time and 55% inference FLOPs acceleration of LLaVA-NeXT with comparable performance. Besides, the PyramidDrop could also serve as a plug-and-play strategy for inference acceleration without training, with better performance and lower inference cost than counterparts.

| **[Evaluation of CGRA Toolchains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19114v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing demands for computing power also propel the need for energy-efficient SoC accelerator architectures. One class for such accelerators are so-called processor arrays, which typically integrate a two-dimensional mesh of interconnected processing elements (PEs). Such arrays are specifically designed to accelerate the execution of multidimensional nested loops by exploiting the intrinsic parallelism of such loops. Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) belong to this class of accelerator architectures. In this work, we analyze four toolchains for mapping loop programs onto CGRAs and compare the resulting mappings wrt. performance, i.e., latency. While most toolchains succeed in simpler kernels like general matrix multiplication, some struggle to find valid mappings for more complex loops like a triangular solver. Furthermore, we observe that the considered CGRA mappers generally tend to underutilize the available PEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>OSSMP...</summary><p>OSSMPIC2025, 1st workshop on Open Source Solutions for Massively Parallel Integrated Circuits. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2502.12062</p></details> |
| **[CoT-ICL Lab: A Petri Dish for Studying Chain-of-Thought Learning from In-Context Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15132v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CoT-ICL Lab, a framework and methodology to generate synthetic tokenized datasets and systematically study chain-of-thought (CoT) in-context learning (ICL) in language models. CoT-ICL Lab allows fine grained control over the complexity of in-context examples by decoupling (1) the causal structure involved in chain token generation from (2) the underlying token processing functions. We train decoder-only transformers (up to 700M parameters) on these datasets and show that CoT accelerates the accuracy transition to higher values across model sizes. In particular, we find that model depth is crucial for leveraging CoT with limited in-context examples, while more examples help shallow models match deeper model performance. Additionally, limiting the diversity of token processing functions throughout training improves causal structure learning via ICL. We also interpret these transitions by analyzing transformer embeddings and attention maps. Overall, CoT-ICL Lab serves as a simple yet powerful testbed for theoretical and empirical insights into ICL and CoT in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 27 figures, 3 tables, code at https://github.com/kvignesh1420/cot-icl-lab</p></details> |
| **[PAPI: Exploiting Dynamic Parallelism in Large Language Model Decoding with a Processing-In-Memory-Enabled Computing System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15470v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for natural language understanding and text generation. An LLM model relies on a time-consuming step called LLM decoding to generate output tokens. Several prior works focus on improving the performance of LLM decoding using parallelism techniques, such as batching and speculative decoding. State-of-the-art LLM decoding has both compute-bound and memory-bound kernels. Some prior works statically identify and map these different kernels to a heterogeneous architecture consisting of both processing-in-memory (PIM) units and computation-centric accelerators. We observe that characteristics of LLM decoding kernels (e.g., whether or not a kernel is memory-bound) can change dynamically due to parameter changes to meet user and/or system demands, making (1) static kernel mapping to PIM units and computation-centric accelerators suboptimal, and (2) one-size-fits-all approach of designing PIM units inefficient due to a large degree of heterogeneity even in memory-bound kernels. In this paper, we aim to accelerate LLM decoding while considering the dynamically changing characteristics of the kernels involved. We propose PAPI (PArallel Decoding with PIM), a PIM-enabled heterogeneous architecture that exploits dynamic scheduling of compute-bound or memory-bound kernels to suitable hardware units. PAPI has two key mechanisms: (1) online kernel characterization to dynamically schedule kernels to the most suitable hardware units at runtime and (2) a PIM-enabled heterogeneous computing system that harmoniously orchestrates both computation-centric processing units and hybrid PIM units with different computing capabilities. Our experimental results on three broadly-used LLMs show that PAPI achieves 1.8$\times$ and 11.1$\times$ speedups over a state-of-the-art heterogeneous LLM accelerator and a state-of-the-art PIM-only LLM accelerator, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ASPLOS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Parallel Tree Search for Efficient LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16235v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4x on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[ServoLNN: Lagrangian Neural Networks Driven by Servomechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19802v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining deep learning with classical physics facilitates the efficient creation of accurate dynamical models. In a recent class of neural network, Lagrangian mechanics is hard-coded into the architecture, and training the network learns the given system. However, the current architectures do not facilitate the modelling of dynamical systems that are driven by servomechanisms (e.g. servomotors, stepper motors, current sources, volumetric pumps). This article presents ServoLNN, a new architecture to model dynamical systems that are driven by servomechanisms. ServoLNN is compatible for use in real-time applications, where the driving motion is known only just-in-time. A PyTorch implementation of ServoLNN is provided. The derivations and results reveal the occurrence of a possible family of solutions that the training may converge on. The effect of the family of solutions on the predicted physical quantities is explored, as is the resolution to reduce the family of solutions to a single solution. Resultantly, the architecture can simultaneously accurately find the energies, power, rate of work, mass matrix, generalised accelerations, generalised forces, and the generalised forces that drive the servomechanisms.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A stochastic first-order method with multi-extrapolated momentum for highly smooth unconstrained optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14488v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem where the objective function exhibits high-order smoothness. Specifically, we propose a new stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated momentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration, followed by a momentum update based on these extrapolations. We demonstrate that the proposed SFOM can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order smoothness of the objective function $f$. Assuming that the $p$th-order derivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous for some $p\ge2$, and under additional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample complexity of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a point $x$ such that $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(x)\|]\le\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary-order smoothness of the objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that improves upon the best-known results without assuming the mean-squared smoothness condition. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical performance of our method and support our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some claims about the contributions were overstated, and we are currently working on the revision</p></details> |

In this paper, we provide an efficient and effective coverage path planning approach that leverages a manipulator's redundancy and task tolerances to minimize costs in joint space. We formulate the problem as a Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem and hierarchically streamline the graph size. Our strategy is to identify guide paths that roughly cover the surface and accelerate the computation by solving a sequence of smaller problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a simulation experiment and an illustrative demonstration using a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a contributed paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[NeoBERT: A Next-Generation BERT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19587v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent innovations in architecture, pre-training, and fine-tuning have led to the remarkable in-context learning and reasoning abilities of large auto-regressive language models such as LLaMA and DeepSeek. In contrast, encoders like BERT and RoBERTa have not seen the same level of progress despite being foundational for many downstream NLP applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce NeoBERT, a next-generation encoder that redefines the capabilities of bidirectional models by integrating state-of-the-art advancements in architecture, modern data, and optimized pre-training methodologies. NeoBERT is designed for seamless adoption: it serves as a plug-and-play replacement for existing base models, relies on an optimal depth-to-width ratio, and leverages an extended context length of 4,096 tokens. Despite its compact 250M parameter footprint, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the massive MTEB benchmark, outperforming BERT large, RoBERTa large, NomicBERT, and ModernBERT under identical fine-tuning conditions. In addition, we rigorously evaluate the impact of each modification on GLUE and design a uniform fine-tuning and evaluation framework for MTEB. We release all code, data, checkpoints, and training scripts to accelerate research and real-world adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 9 tables.

| **[Can Language Models Falsify? Evaluating Algorithmic Reasoning with Counterexample Creation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19414v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing excitement about the potential of Language Models (LMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. Falsifying hypotheses is key to scientific progress, as it allows claims to be iteratively refined over time. This process requires significant researcher effort, reasoning, and ingenuity. Yet current benchmarks for LMs predominantly assess their ability to generate solutions rather than challenge them. We advocate for developing benchmarks that evaluate this inverse capability - creating counterexamples for subtly incorrect solutions. To demonstrate this approach, we start with the domain of algorithmic problem solving, where counterexamples can be evaluated automatically using code execution. Specifically, we introduce REFUTE, a dynamically updating benchmark that includes recent problems and incorrect submissions from programming competitions, where human experts successfully identified counterexamples. Our analysis finds that the best reasoning agents, even OpenAI o3-mini (high) with code execution feedback, can create counterexamples for only <9% of incorrect solutions in REFUTE, even though ratings indicate its ability to solve up to 48% of these problems from scratch. We hope our work spurs progress in evaluating and enhancing LMs' ability to falsify incorrect solutions - a capability that is crucial for both accelerating research and making models self-improve through reliable reflective reasoning.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Deep Compression Autoencoder for Efficient High-Resolution Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10733v6)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder models for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

| **[Multiclass Post-Earthquake Building Assessment Integrating Optical and SAR Satellite Imagery, Ground Motion, and Soil Data with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04664v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate assessments of building damage are crucial for effective response and recovery in the aftermath of earthquakes. Conventional preliminary damage assessments (PDA) often rely on manual door-to-door inspections, which are not only time-consuming but also pose significant safety risks. To safely expedite the PDA process, researchers have studied the applicability of satellite imagery processed with heuristic and machine learning approaches. These approaches output binary or, more recently, multiclass damage states at the scale of a block or a single building. However, the current performance of such approaches limits practical applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a metadata-enriched, transformer based framework that combines high-resolution post-earthquake satellite imagery with building-specific metadata relevant to the seismic performance of the structure. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiclass post-earthquake damage identification for buildings from the Turkey-Syria earthquake on February 6, 2023. Specifically, we demonstrate that incorporating metadata, such as seismic intensity indicators, soil properties, and SAR damage proxy maps not only enhances the model's accuracy and ability to distinguish between damage classes, but also improves its generalizability across various regions. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed, class-wise analysis of feature importance to understand the model's decision-making across different levels of building damage. This analysis reveals how individual metadata features uniquely contribute to predictions for each damage class. By leveraging both satellite imagery and metadata, our proposed framework enables faster and more accurate damage assessments for precise, multiclass, building-level evaluations that can improve disaster response and accelerate recovery efforts for affected communities.</p></details> | 28 Pages, 12 Figures |
| **[Simplifying Causal Mediation Analysis for Time-to-Event Outcomes using Pseudo-Values](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17533v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mediation analysis for survival outcomes is challenging. Most existing methods quantify the treatment effect using the hazard ratio (HR) and attempt to decompose the HR into the direct effect of treatment plus an indirect, or mediated, effect. However, the HR is not expressible as an expectation, which complicates this decomposition, both in terms of estimation and interpretation. Here, we present an alternative approach which leverages pseudo-values to simplify estimation and inference. Pseudo-values take censoring into account during their construction, and once derived, can be modeled in the same way as any continuous outcome. Thus, pseudo-values enable mediation analysis for a survival outcome to fit seamlessly into standard mediation software (e.g. CMAverse in R). Pseudo-values are easy to calculate via a leave-one-observation-out procedure (i.e. jackknifing) and the calculation can be accelerated when the influence function of the estimator is known. Mediation analysis for causal effects defined by survival probabilities, restricted mean survival time, and cumulative incidence functions - in the presence of competing risks - can all be performed within this framework. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the method is unbiased across 324 scenarios/estimands and controls the type-I error at the nominal level under the null of no mediation. We illustrate the approach using data from the PARADIGMS clinical trial for the treatment of pediatric multiple sclerosis using fingolimod. In particular, we evaluate whether an imaging biomarker lies on the causal path between treatment and time-to-relapse, which aids in justifying this biomarker as a surrogate outcome.

A Policy Coverage Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19255v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency is critical for online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). While existing works investigate sample-efficient online exploration strategies, the potential of utilizing misspecified yet relevant reward models to accelerate learning remains underexplored. This paper studies how to transfer knowledge from those imperfect reward models in online RLHF. We start by identifying a novel property of the KL-regularized RLHF objective: \emph{a policy's ability to cover the optimal policy is captured by its sub-optimality}. Building on this insight, we propose a theoretical transfer learning algorithm with provable benefits compared to standard online learning. Our approach achieves low regret in the early stage by quickly adapting to the best available source reward models without prior knowledge of their quality, and over time, it attains an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound \emph{independent} of structural complexity measures. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop an empirical algorithm with improved computational efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically in summarization tasks.</p></details> | 35 Pages |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Formal methods are recommended by functional safety standards (e.g., by IEC 61511 for the process industry and by the generic IEC 61508) and play a crucial role. Their structured approach reduces ambiguity in system requirements, facilitating early error detection. This paper introduces a formal verification service for PLC (programmable logic controller) programs compliant with functional safety standards, providing external expertise to organizations while eliminating the need for extensive internal training. It offers a cost-effective solution to meet the rising demands for formal verification processes. The approach is extended to include modeling time-dependent, know-how-protected components, enabling formal verification of real safety-critical applications. A case study shows the application of PLC formal verification as a service provided by CERN in a safety-critical installation at the GSI particle accelerator facility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of NFM 2025 paper</p></details> |

Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures.

Recent advancements that leverage target LLM's contextual information, such as hidden states and KV cache, have shown significant practical improvements. However, these approaches suffer from inconsistent context between training and decoding. We also observe another discrepancy between the training and decoding objectives in existing speculative sampling methods. In this work, we propose a solution named HArmonized Speculative Sampling (HASS) that learns harmonized representations to address these issues. HASS accelerates the decoding stage without adding inference overhead through harmonized objective distillation and harmonized context alignment. Experiments on four LLaMA models demonstrate that HASS achieves 2.81x-4.05x wall-clock time speedup ratio averaging across three datasets, surpassing EAGLE-2 by 8%-20%.

| **[Faster Diffusion via Temporal Attention Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02747v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the role of attention mechanism during inference in text-conditional diffusion models. Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%. The code of TGATE is available at https://github.com/HaozheLiu-ST/T-GATE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR: https://openreview.net/forum?id=xXs2GKXPnH</p></details> |

The paper presents a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of this paradigm by the means of a systematic mapping study and a scoping review of relevant literature. According to the mapping and review, the paradigm has been extensively discussed, used, and developed further since the late 1990s. Partially driven by the insecurity of the Internet of things, the volume of publications has accelerated from the circa mid-2010s onward. The publications reviewed indicate that the paradigm has been adopted in numerous different contexts. It has also been expanded with security design principles not originally considered when the paradigm was initiated in the mid-1970s. Among the newer principles are an "off by default" principle, various overriding and fallback principles, as well as those related to the zero trust model.

Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 1.1B and datasets of OpenWebText and MiniPile. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Departing from conventional methodologies that rely on aggregating computationally intensive 4D costs, LightStereo adopts the 3D cost volume as a lightweight alternative. While similar approaches have been explored previously, our breakthrough lies in enhancing performance through a dedicated focus on the channel dimension of the 3D cost volume, where the distribution of matching costs is encapsulated. Our exhaustive exploration has yielded plenty of strategies to amplify the capacity of the pivotal dimension, ensuring both precision and efficiency. We compare the proposed LightStereo with existing state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, which demonstrate its superior performance in speed, accuracy, and resource utilization. LightStereo achieves a competitive EPE metric in the SceneFlow datasets while demanding a minimum of only 22 GFLOPs and 17 ms of runtime, and ranks 1st on KITTI 2015 among real-time models.

To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution.

Training KG embedding can take a significantly long time, especially for larger datasets. Our analysis shows that the gradient computation of embedding is one of the dominant functions in the translation-based KG embedding training loop. We address this issue by replacing the core embedding computation with SpMM (Sparse-Dense Matrix Multiplication) kernels. This allows us to unify multiple scatter (and gather) operations as a single operation, reducing training time and memory usage. We create a general framework for training KG models using sparse kernels and implement four models, namely TransE, TransR, TransH, and TorusE. Our sparse implementations exhibit up to 5.3x speedup on the CPU and up to 4.2x speedup on the GPU with a significantly low GPU memory footprint. The speedups are consistent across large and small datasets for a given model. Our proposed sparse approach can be extended to accelerate other translation-based (such as TransC, TransM, etc.) and non-translational (such as DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, etc.) models as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages.

| **[Efficient Inference for Large Language Model-based Generative Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05165v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding. For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5x speedup under relaxed sampling verification. The codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/Linxyhaha/AtSpeed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

This work investigates the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to solve a collection of contact-rich manipulation tasks on a humanoid embodiment. We introduce novel techniques to overcome the identified challenges with empirical validation. Our main contributions include an automated real-to-sim tuning module that brings the simulated environment closer to the real world, a generalized reward design scheme that simplifies reward engineering for long-horizon contact-rich manipulation tasks, a divide-and-conquer distillation process that improves the sample efficiency of hard-exploration problems while maintaining sim-to-real performance, and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations to bridge the sim-to-real perception gap. We show promising results on three humanoid dexterous manipulation tasks, with ablation studies on each technique. Our work presents a successful approach to learning humanoid dexterous manipulation using sim-to-real reinforcement learning, achieving robust generalization and high performance without the need for human demonstration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page can be found at https://toruowo.github.io/recipe/</p></details> |
| **[Walking the Web of Concept-Class Relationships in Incrementally Trained Interpretable Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20393v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept-based methods have emerged as a promising direction to develop interpretable neural networks in standard supervised settings. However, most works that study them in incremental settings assume either a static concept set across all experiences or assume that each experience relies on a distinct set of concepts. In this work, we study concept-based models in a more realistic, dynamic setting where new classes may rely on older concepts in addition to introducing new concepts themselves. We show that concepts and classes form a complex web of relationships, which is susceptible to degradation and needs to be preserved and augmented across experiences. We introduce new metrics to show that existing concept-based models cannot preserve these relationships even when trained using methods to prevent catastrophic forgetting, since they cannot handle forgetting at concept, class, and concept-class relationship levels simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a novel method - MuCIL - that uses multimodal concepts to perform classification without increasing the number of trainable parameters across experiences. The multimodal concepts are aligned to concepts provided in natural language, making them interpretable by design. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art classification performance compared to other concept-based models, achieving over 2$\times$ the classification performance in some cases. We also study the ability of our model to perform interventions on concepts, and show that it can localize visual concepts in input images, providing post-hoc interpretations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main text, 6 figures in main text, 11 pages of Appendix, published in AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Extending physics-based motion imitation to complex human-object interactions (HOIs) is challenging due to intricate human-object coupling, variability in object geometries, and artifacts in motion capture data, such as inaccurate contacts and limited hand detail. We introduce InterMimic, a framework that enables a single policy to robustly learn from hours of imperfect MoCap data covering diverse full-body interactions with dynamic and varied objects. Our key insight is to employ a curriculum strategy -- perfect first, then scale up. We first train subject-specific teacher policies to mimic, retarget, and refine motion capture data. Next, we distill these teachers into a student policy, with the teachers acting as online experts providing direct supervision, as well as high-quality references. Notably, we incorporate RL fine-tuning on the student policy to surpass mere demonstration replication and achieve higher-quality solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that InterMimic produces realistic and diverse interactions across multiple HOI datasets. The learned policy generalizes in a zero-shot manner and seamlessly integrates with kinematic generators, elevating the framework from mere imitation to generative modeling of complex human-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Beyond Next-Token: Next-X Prediction for Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20388v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) modeling, known for its next-token prediction paradigm, underpins state-of-the-art language and visual generative models. Traditionally, a ``token'' is treated as the smallest prediction unit, often a discrete symbol in language or a quantized patch in vision. However, the optimal token definition for 2D image structures remains an open question. Moreover, AR models suffer from exposure bias, where teacher forcing during training leads to error accumulation at inference. In this paper, we propose xAR, a generalized AR framework that extends the notion of a token to an entity X, which can represent an individual patch token, a cell (a $k\times k$ grouping of neighboring patches), a subsample (a non-local grouping of distant patches), a scale (coarse-to-fine resolution), or even a whole image. Additionally, we reformulate discrete token classification as \textbf{continuous entity regression}, leveraging flow-matching methods at each AR step. This approach conditions training on noisy entities instead of ground truth tokens, leading to Noisy Context Learning, which effectively alleviates exposure bias. As a result, xAR offers two key advantages: (1) it enables flexible prediction units that capture different contextual granularity and spatial structures, and (2) it mitigates exposure bias by avoiding reliance on teacher forcing. On ImageNet-256 generation benchmark, our base model, xAR-B (172M), outperforms DiT-XL/SiT-XL (675M) while achieving 20$\times$ faster inference. Meanwhile, xAR-H sets a new state-of-the-art with an FID of 1.24, running 2.2$\times$ faster than the previous best-performing model without relying on vision foundation modules (\eg, DINOv2) or advanced guidance interval sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at \url{https://oliverrensu.github.io/project/xAR}</p></details> |

| **[Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A Security Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20383v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals - nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://vulnerable-ai-agents.github.io</p></details> |

Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Monocular Dynamic Scene Rendering via Sparse Time-Variant Attribute Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20378v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rendering dynamic scenes from monocular videos is a crucial yet challenging task. The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution to represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time steps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of Gaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model every Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the primary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of Gaussians. In response, we introduce Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS), which represents dynamic scenes via sparse time-variant attribute modeling. Our approach formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid representation, with the motion flow of dense Gaussians calculated via a classical kernel representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised strategy to efficiently filter out anchors corresponding to static areas. Only anchors associated with deformable objects are input into MLPs to query time-variant attributes. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our EDGS significantly improves the rendering speed with superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Tight Inversion: Image-Conditioned Inversion for Real Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20376v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models offer powerful image editing capabilities. To edit real images, many methods rely on the inversion of the image into Gaussian noise. A common approach to invert an image is to gradually add noise to the image, where the noise is determined by reversing the sampling equation. This process has an inherent tradeoff between reconstruction and editability, limiting the editing of challenging images such as highly-detailed ones. Recognizing the reliance of text-to-image models inversion on a text condition, this work explores the importance of the condition choice. We show that a condition that precisely aligns with the input image significantly improves the inversion quality. Based on our findings, we introduce Tight Inversion, an inversion method that utilizes the most possible precise condition -- the input image itself. This tight condition narrows the distribution of the model's output and enhances both reconstruction and editability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when combined with existing inversion methods through extensive experiments, evaluating the reconstruction accuracy as well as the integration with various editing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://tight-inversion.github.io</p></details> |

In particular, we introduce manual bridges, a framework that expands the kinds of constraints that can be practically used to form so-called diffusion bridges. We develop a mechanism for combining multiple such constraints so that the resulting multiply-constrained model remains a manual bridge that respects all constraints. We also develop a mechanism for training a diffusion model that respects such multiple constraints while also adapting it to match a data distribution. We develop and extend theory demonstrating the mathematical validity of our mechanisms. Additionally, we demonstrate our mechanism in constrained generative modeling tasks, highlighting a particular high-value application in modeling trajectory initializations for path planning and control in autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Previously, two main settings existed for two-character interaction generation: (1) generating one's motions based on the counterpart's complete motion sequence, and (2) jointly generating two-character motions based on specific conditions. We argue that these settings fail to model the process of real-life two-character interactions, where humans will react to their counterparts in real time and act as independent individuals. In contrast, we propose an online reaction policy, called Ready-to-React, to generate the next character pose based on past observed motions. Each character has its own reaction policy as its "brain", enabling them to interact like real humans in a streaming manner. Our policy is implemented by incorporating a diffusion head into an auto-regressive model, which can dynamically respond to the counterpart's motions while effectively mitigating the error accumulation throughout the generation process. We conduct comprehensive experiments using the challenging boxing task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines and can generate extended motion sequences. Additionally, we show that our approach can be controlled by sparse signals, making it well-suited for VR and other online interactive environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICLR 2025 conference paper</p></details> |

This technology excels at inferring relationships within vast unstructured or semi-structured datasets. The legal domain here comprises complex data characterized by extensive, interrelated, and semi-structured knowledge systems with complex relations. It comprises constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. Extracting insights and navigating the intricate networks of legal documents and their relations is crucial for effective legal research. Here, we introduce a generative AI system that integrates RAG, VS, and KG, constructed via Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), to enhance legal information retrieval and AI reasoning and minimize hallucinations. In the legal system, these technologies empower AI agents to identify and analyze complex connections among cases, statutes, and legal precedents, uncovering hidden relationships and predicting legal trends-challenging tasks that are essential for ensuring justice and improving operational efficiency. Our system employs web scraping techniques to systematically collect legal texts, such as statutes, constitutional provisions, and case law, from publicly accessible platforms like Justia. It bridges the gap between traditional keyword-based searches and contextual understanding by leveraging advanced semantic representations, hierarchical relationships, and latent topic discovery. This framework supports legal document clustering, summarization, and cross-referencing, for scalable, interpretable, and accurate retrieval for semi-structured data while advancing computational law and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CNS 2025, Boston, MA, USA</p></details> |

The attainable asymptotic entropy profiles and their dominant terms as functions of $q$ are computable. This generalizes a construction of Mat\'u\v{s} which gives an information-theoretic interpretation to algebraic matroids.</p></details> | 22 pages, 3 figures |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit- thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving the Efficiency of a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Power Management System for HPC Clusters Using Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20348v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes. Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy. Experimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other training orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage. The best agent achieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66% improvement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15 minutes of idle time). In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by 9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective resource utilization. Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations, power levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to changing system parameters without retraining. These findings demonstrate that curriculum learning can significantly improve DRL-based power management in HPC, balancing energy savings, quality of service, and robustness to diverse configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 17 figures, accepted at Supercomputing Asia '25, published by ACM</p></details> |

However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Webpa...</summary><p>Webpage: https://tianxingchen.github.io/G3Flow/, accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Building reliable sim driving agents by scaling self-play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14706v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation agents are essential for designing and testing systems that interact with humans, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs). These agents serve various purposes, from benchmarking AV performance to stress-testing system limits, but all applications share one key requirement: reliability. To enable systematic experimentation, a simulation agent must behave as intended. It should minimize actions that may lead to undesired outcomes, such as collisions, which can distort the signal-to-noise ratio in analyses. As a foundation for reliable sim agents, we propose scaling self-play to thousands of scenarios on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset under semi-realistic limits on human perception and control. Training from scratch on a single GPU, our agents nearly solve the full training set within a day. They generalize effectively to unseen test scenes, achieving a 99.8% goal completion rate with less than 0.8% combined collision and off-road incidents across 10,000 held-out scenarios. Beyond in-distribution generalization, our agents show partial robustness to out-of-distribution scenes and can be fine-tuned in minutes to reach near-perfect performance in those cases. We open-source the pre-trained agents and integrate them with a batched multi-agent simulator. Demonstrations of agent behaviors can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/reliable-sim-agents.</p></details> | v2 |

Recently, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS, we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE for publication</p></details> |

Our method repurposes the pre-trained video latent diffusion model for generating looping videos from text prompts without any training. During inference, we first construct a latent cycle by connecting the starting and ending noise of the videos. Given that the temporal consistency can be maintained by the context of the video diffusion model, we perform multi-frame latent denoising by gradually shifting the first-frame latent to the end in each step. As a result, the denoising context varies in each step while maintaining consistency throughout the inference process. Moreover, the latent cycle in our method can be of any length. This extends our latent-shifting approach to generate seamless looping videos beyond the scope of the video diffusion model's context. Unlike previous cinemagraphs, the proposed method does not require an image as appearance, which will restrict the motions of the generated results. Instead, our method can produce more dynamic motion and better visual quality. We conduct multiple experiments and comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its efficacy in different scenarios. All the code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mobius-diffusion.github.io/ ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/YisuiTT/Mobius</p></details> |

Other methods have focused on the low-budget regime, but do poorly as label budgets increase. As the line between "low" and "high" budgets varies by problem, this is a serious issue in practice. We propose uncertainty coverage, an objective which generalizes a variety of low- and high-budget objectives, as well as natural, hyperparameter-light methods to smoothly interpolate between low- and high-budget regimes. We call greedy optimization of the estimate Uncertainty Herding; this simple method is computationally fast, and we prove that it nearly optimizes the distribution-level coverage. In experimental validation across a variety of active learning tasks, our proposal matches or beats state-of-the-art performance in essentially all cases; it is the only method of which we are aware that reliably works well in both low- and high-budget settings.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR2025 |

However, their reliance on well-prepared tools limits their applicability in the medical domain, which requires to train specialized models. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We present M3Builder, a novel multi-agent system designed to automate machine learning (ML) in medical imaging. At its core, M3Builder employs four specialized agents that collaborate to tackle complex, multi-step medical ML workflows, from automated data processing and environment configuration to self-contained auto debugging and model training. These agents operate within a medical imaging ML workspace, a structured environment designed to provide agents with free-text descriptions of datasets, training codes, and interaction tools, enabling seamless communication and task execution. (ii) To evaluate progress in automated medical imaging ML, we propose M3Bench, a benchmark comprising four general tasks on 14 training datasets, across five anatomies and three imaging modalities, covering both 2D and 3D data. (iii) We experiment with seven state-of-the-art large language models serving as agent cores for our system, such as Claude series, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3. Compared to existing ML agentic designs, M3Builder shows superior performance on completing ML tasks in medical imaging, achieving a 94.29% success rate using Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the agent core, showing huge potential towards fully automated machine learning in medical imaging.</p></details> | 38 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies.

Multi-source data are collected from different high-throughput technologies while multi-way data are collected over multiple dimensions, yielding multiple tensor arrays. Integrative analysis of these data sets is needed, e.g., to capture and synthesize different facets of complex biological systems. However, despite growing interest in multi-source and multi-way factorization techniques, methods that can handle data that are both multi-source and multi-way are limited. In this work, we propose a Multiple Linked Tensors Factorization (MULTIFAC) method extending the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition to simultaneously reduce the dimension of multiple multi-way arrays and approximate underlying signal. We first introduce a version of the CP factorization with L2 penalties on the latent factors, leading to rank sparsity. When extended to multiple linked tensors, the method automatically reveals latent components that are shared across data sources or individual to each data source. We also extend the decomposition algorithm to its expectation-maximization (EM) version to handle incomplete data with imputation. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate MULTIFAC's ability to (i) approximate underlying signal, (ii) identify shared and unshared structures, and (iii) impute missing data. The approach yields an interpretable decomposition on multi-way multi-omics data for a study on early-life iron deficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing model merging techniques primarily focus on resolving conflicts between task-specific models, they often overlook potential security threats, particularly the risk of backdoor attacks in the open-source model ecosystem. In this paper, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of existing model merging methods to backdoor attacks, identifying two critical challenges: backdoor succession and backdoor transfer. To address these issues, we propose a novel Defense-Aware Merging (DAM) approach that simultaneously mitigates task interference and backdoor vulnerabilities. Specifically, DAM employs a meta-learning-based optimization method with dual masks to identify a shared and safety-aware subspace for model merging. These masks are alternately optimized: the Task-Shared mask identifies common beneficial parameters across tasks, aiming to preserve task-specific knowledge while reducing interference, while the Backdoor-Detection mask isolates potentially harmful parameters to neutralize security threats. This dual-mask design allows us to carefully balance the preservation of useful knowledge and the removal of potential vulnerabilities. Compared to existing merging methods, DAM achieves a more favorable balance between performance and security, reducing the attack success rate by 2-10 percentage points while sacrificing only about 1% in accuracy. Furthermore, DAM exhibits robust performance and broad applicability across various types of backdoor attacks and the number of compromised models involved in the merging process. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/Yangjinluan/DAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>arxiv...</summary><p>arxiv version of ICLR2025</p></details> |

Real-time AutoML enables the design process to happen while the ML algorithm is being applied to a task. Real-time AutoML is an emerging research area, as such existing real-time AutoML techniques need improvement with respect to the quality of designs and time taken to create designs. To address these issues, this study proposes an Online Meta-learning for AutoML in Real-time (OnMAR) approach. Meta-learning gathers information about the optimisation process undertaken by the ML algorithm in the form of meta-features. Meta-features are used in conjunction with a meta-learner to optimise the optimisation process. The OnMAR approach uses a meta-learner to predict the accuracy of an ML design. If the accuracy predicted by the meta-learner is sufficient, the design is used, and if the predicted accuracy is low, an optimisation technique creates a new design. A genetic algorithm (GA) is the optimisation technique used as part of the OnMAR approach. Different meta-learners (k-nearest neighbours, random forest and XGBoost) are tested. The OnMAR approach is model-agnostic (i.e. not specific to a single real-time AutoML application) and therefore evaluated on three different real-time AutoML applications, namely: composing an image clustering algorithm, configuring the hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network, and configuring a video classification pipeline. The OnMAR approach is effective, matching or outperforming existing real-time AutoML approaches, with the added benefit of a faster runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First page is a graphical abstract, this is a journal article submission</p></details> |

Specifically, we propose a direct causal effect metric called the Probabilistic vAriational Causal Effect (PACE) and its variations adhering to certain postulates applicable to both non-binary and binary treatments. The PACE metric is derived by integrating the concept of total variation, representing the purely causal component, with interventions on the treatment value, combined with the probabilities of hypothetical transitioning between treatment levels. PACE features a parameter $d$, where lower values of $d$ correspond to scenarios emphasizing rare treatment values, while higher values of $d$ focus on situations where the causal impact of more frequent treatment levels is more relevant. Thus, instead of a single causal effect value, we provide a causal effect function of the degree $d$. Additionally, we introduce positive and negative PACE to measure the respective positive and negative causal changes in the outcome as exposure values shift. We also consider normalized versions of PACE, referred to MEAN PACE. Furthermore, we provide an identifiability criterion for PACE to handle counterfactual challenges in observational studies, and we define several generalizations of our methodology. Lastly, we compare our framework with other well-known causal frameworks through the analysis of various examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

The Maker-Breaker game on $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is a combinatorial game between two players, Maker and Breaker. Beginning with Maker, the players take turns claiming vertices from $X$ that have not yet been claimed. Maker wins if she manages to claim all vertices of some hyperedge $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Breaker wins if he claims at least one vertex in every hyperedge. M. L. Rahman and Thomas Watson proved in 2021 that, even when only Maker-Breaker games on 6-uniform hypergraphs are considered, the decision problem of determining which player has a winning strategy is PSPACE-complete. They also showed that the problem is NL-hard when considering hypergraphs of rank 5. In this paper, we improve the latter result by showing that deciding who wins Maker-Breaker games on 5-uniform hypergraphs is still a PSPACE-complete problem. We achieve this by polynomial transformation from the problem of solving the generalized geography game on bipartite digraphs with vertex degrees 3 or less, which is known to be PSPACE-complete.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 tables containing figures, 5 references</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Deep Tabular Methods with Temporal Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20260v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep tabular models have demonstrated remarkable success on i.i.d. data, excelling in a variety of structured data tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection perform. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

However, modeling voter behavior presents unique challenges due to limited voter-level data, evolving political landscapes, and the complexity of human reasoning. In this study, we develop a theory-driven, multi-step reasoning framework that integrates demographic, temporal and ideological factors to simulate voter decision-making at scale. Using synthetic personas calibrated to real-world voter data, we conduct large-scale simulations of recent U.S. presidential elections. Our method significantly improves simulation accuracy while mitigating model biases. We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different LLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from LLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework for modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs in political science research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.03321 This version adds a new model to our experimental setup, modifies the paper's main discussion, and updates the authorship list</p></details> |

On average, RLE outperforms noise-based methods, which perturb the agent's actions, and bonus-based exploration, which rewards the agent for attempting novel behaviors. The core idea of RLE is to encourage the agent to explore different parts of the environment by pursuing randomly sampled goals in a latent space. RLE is as simple as noise-based methods, as it avoids complex bonus calculations but retains the deep exploration benefits of bonus-based methods. Our experiments show that RLE improves performance on average in both discrete (e.g., Atari) and continuous control tasks (e.g., Isaac Gym), enhancing exploration while remaining a simple and general plug-in for existing RL algorithms.

Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation.

However, adhering to complex instructions remains a major challenge. Current approaches to generating complex instructions are often irrelevant to the current instruction requirements or suffer from limited scalability and diversity. Moreover, methods such as back-translation, while effective for simple instruction generation, fail to leverage the rich contents and structures in large web corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic iterative refinement framework to generate complex instructions with constraints, which not only better reflects the requirements of real scenarios but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to follow complex instructions. The AIR framework consists of two stages: (1)Generate an initial instruction from a document; (2)Iteratively refine instructions with LLM-as-judge guidance by comparing the model's output with the document to incorporate valuable constraints. Finally, we construct the AIR-10K dataset with 10K complex instructions and demonstrate that instructions generated with our approach significantly improve the model's ability to follow complex instructions, outperforming existing methods for instruction generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally, 20 pages</p></details> |

Currently, the state-of-the-art methods in MIG are primarily adapter-based. However, these methods necessitate retraining a new adapter each time a more advanced model is released, resulting in significant resource consumption. A methodology named Depth-Driven Decoupled Instance Synthesis (3DIS) has been introduced, which decouples MIG into two distinct phases: 1) depth-based scene construction and 2) detail rendering with widely pre-trained depth control models. The 3DIS method requires adapter training solely during the scene construction phase, while enabling various models to perform training-free detail rendering. Initially, 3DIS focused on rendering techniques utilizing U-Net architectures such as SD1.5, SD2, and SDXL, without exploring the potential of recent DiT-based models like FLUX. In this paper, we present 3DIS-FLUX, an extension of the 3DIS framework that integrates the FLUX model for enhanced rendering capabilities. Specifically, we employ the FLUX.1-Depth-dev model for depth map controlled image generation and introduce a detail renderer that manipulates the Attention Mask in FLUX's Joint Attention mechanism based on layout information. This approach allows for the precise rendering of fine-grained attributes of each instance. Our experimental results indicate that 3DIS-FLUX, leveraging the FLUX model, outperforms the original 3DIS method, which utilized SD2 and SDXL, and surpasses current state-of-the-art adapter-based methods in terms of both performance and image quality.

| **[Unveiling Redundancy in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs): A Systematic Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13588v1)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increased model capacity of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and the demand for generating higher resolutions of images and videos have led to a significant rise in inference latency, impacting real-time performance adversely. While prior research has highlighted the presence of high similarity in activation values between adjacent diffusion steps (referred to as redundancy) and proposed various caching mechanisms to mitigate computational overhead, the exploration of redundancy in existing literature remains limited, with findings often not generalizable across different DiT models. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive investigation into redundancy across a broad spectrum of mainstream DiT models. Our experimental analysis reveals substantial variations in the distribution of redundancy across diffusion steps among different DiT models. Interestingly, within a single model, the redundancy distribution remains stable regardless of variations in input prompts, step counts, or scheduling strategies. Given the lack of a consistent pattern across diverse models, caching strategies designed for a specific group of models may not easily transfer to others. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a tool for analyzing the redundancy of individual models, enabling subsequent research to develop tailored caching strategies for specific model architectures.

Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one. Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error. Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the statistical rates and the computational efficiency are all dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024. v3 updated to camera-ready version with many typos fixed; v2 fixed typos, added Fig. 1 and added clarifications</p></details> |

Despite its promising capabilities, Lumina-T2X still encounters challenges including training instability, slow inference, and extrapolation artifacts. In this paper, we present Lumina-Next, an improved version of Lumina-T2X, showcasing stronger generation performance with increased training and inference efficiency. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of the Flag-DiT architecture and identify several suboptimal components, which we address by introducing the Next-DiT architecture with 3D RoPE and sandwich normalizations. To enable better resolution extrapolation, we thoroughly compare different context extrapolation methods applied to text-to-image generation with 3D RoPE, and propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE tailored for diffusion transformers. Additionally, we introduced a sigmoid time discretization schedule to reduce sampling steps in solving the Flow ODE and the Context Drop method to merge redundant visual tokens for faster network evaluation, effectively boosting the overall sampling speed. Thanks to these improvements, Lumina-Next not only improves the quality and efficiency of basic text-to-image generation but also demonstrates superior resolution extrapolation capabilities and multilingual generation using decoder-based LLMs as the text encoder, all in a zero-shot manner. To further validate Lumina-Next as a versatile generative framework, we instantiate it on diverse tasks including visual recognition, multi-view, audio, music, and point cloud generation, showcasing strong performance across these domains. By releasing all codes and model weights, we aim to advance the development of next-generation generative AI capable of universal modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at: https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-T2X</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose \textbf{DiT}, a self-supervised pre-trained \textbf{D}ocument \textbf{I}mage \textbf{T}ransformer model using large-scale unlabeled text images for Document AI tasks, which is essential since no supervised counterparts ever exist due to the lack of human-labeled document images.

Experiment results have illustrated that the self-supervised pre-trained DiT model achieves new state-of-the-art results on these downstream tasks, e.g. document image classification (91.11 $\rightarrow$ 92.69), document layout analysis (91.0 $\rightarrow$ 94.9), table detection (94.23 $\rightarrow$ 96.55) and text detection for OCR (93.07 $\rightarrow$ 94.29).

| **[Beyond Next-Token: Next-X Prediction for Autoregressive Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20388v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) modeling, known for its next-token prediction paradigm, underpins state-of-the-art language and visual generative models. Traditionally, a ``token'' is treated as the smallest prediction unit, often a discrete symbol in language or a quantized patch in vision. However, the optimal token definition for 2D image structures remains an open question. Moreover, AR models suffer from exposure bias, where teacher forcing during training leads to error accumulation at inference. In this paper, we propose xAR, a generalized AR framework that extends the notion of a token to an entity X, which can represent an individual patch token, a cell (a $k\times k$ grouping of neighboring patches), a subsample (a non-local grouping of distant patches), a scale (coarse-to-fine resolution), or even a whole image. Additionally, we reformulate discrete token classification as \textbf{continuous entity regression}, leveraging flow-matching methods at each AR step. This approach conditions training on noisy entities instead of ground truth tokens, leading to Noisy Context Learning, which effectively alleviates exposure bias. As a result, xAR offers two key advantages: (1) it enables flexible prediction units that capture different contextual granularity and spatial structures, and (2) it mitigates exposure bias by avoiding reliance on teacher forcing. On ImageNet-256 generation benchmark, our base model, xAR-B (172M), outperforms DiT-XL/SiT-XL (675M) while achieving 20$\times$ faster inference. Meanwhile, xAR-H sets a new state-of-the-art with an FID of 1.24, running 2.2$\times$ faster than the previous best-performing model without relying on vision foundation modules (\eg, DINOv2) or advanced guidance interval sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at \url{https://oliverrensu.github.io/project/xAR}</p></details> |

A simulation environment was developed to validate the proposed method across diverse scenarios, each posing unique challenges in navigation and communication.

Recent literature on EMG artifact removal has moved beyond traditional linear algorithms in favor of machine learning-based systems. However, existing deep learning-based filtration methods often have large compute footprints and prohibitively long training times. In this study, we present a new machine learning-based system for filtering EMG interference from EEG data using an autoencoder-targeted adversarial transformer (AT-AT). By leveraging the lightweight expressivity of an autoencoder to determine optimal time-series transformer application sites, our AT-AT architecture achieves a >90% model size reduction compared to published artifact removal models. The addition of adversarial training ensures that filtered signals adhere to the fundamental characteristics of EEG data. We trained AT-AT using published neural data from 67 subjects and found that the system was able to achieve comparable test performance to larger models; AT-AT posted a mean reconstructive correlation coefficient above 0.95 at an initial signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2 dB and 0.70 at -7 dB SNR. Further research generalizing these results to broader sample sizes beyond these isolated test cases will be crucial; while outside the scope of this study, we also include results from a real-world deployment of AT-AT in the Appendix.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CNS 2025, Boston, MA, USA</p></details> |

The core premise of this paper is built around demonstrating methods to elucidate the underlying low-dimensional geometric structure present in high-dimensional brainwave data in order to assist in downstream BCI-related neural classification tasks. We demonstrate two pipelines related to electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing: (1) a preliminary pipeline removing noise from individual EEG channels, and (2) a downstream manifold learning pipeline uncovering geometric structure across networks of EEG channels. We conduct preliminary validation using two EEG datasets and situate our demonstration in the context of the BCI-relevant imagined digit decoding problem. Our preliminary pipeline uses an attention-based EEG filtration network to extract clean signal from individual EEG channels. Our primary pipeline uses a fast Fourier transform, a Laplacian eigenmap, a discrete analog of Ricci flow via Ollivier's notion of Ricci curvature, and a graph convolutional network to perform dimensionality reduction on high-dimensional multi-channel EEG data in order to enable regularizable downstream classification. Our system achieves competitive performance with existing signal processing and classification benchmarks; we demonstrate a mean test correlation coefficient of >0.95 at 2 dB on semi-synthetic neural denoising and a downstream EEG-based classification accuracy of 0.97 on distinguishing digit- versus non-digit- thoughts. Results are preliminary and our geometric machine learning pipeline should be validated by more extensive follow-up studies; generalizing these results to larger inter-subject sample sizes, different hardware systems, and broader use cases will be crucial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving the Efficiency of a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Power Management System for HPC Clusters Using Curriculum Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20348v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes. Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy. Experimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other training orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage. The best agent achieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66% improvement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15 minutes of idle time). In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by 9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective resource utilization. Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations, power levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to changing system parameters without retraining. These findings demonstrate that curriculum learning can significantly improve DRL-based power management in HPC, balancing energy savings, quality of service, and robustness to diverse configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 17 figures, accepted at Supercomputing Asia '25, published by ACM</p></details> |

This paper presents a novel approach for modeling the response of human drivers to visual cues provided by a speed advisory system using a Koopman-based method with online updates. The proposed method utilizes the Koopman operator to transform the nonlinear dynamics of driver-speed advisory system interactions into a linear framework, allowing for efficient real-time prediction. An online update mechanism based on Recursive Least Squares (RLS) is integrated into the Koopman-based model to ensure continuous adaptation to changes in driver behavior over time. The model is validated using data collected from a human-in-the-loop driving simulator, capturing diverse driver-specific trajectories. The results demonstrate that the offline learned Koopman-based model can closely predict driver behavior and its accuracy is further enhanced through an online update mechanism with the RLS method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ACC 2025</p></details> |

However, insufficient consideration of manufacturability during the optimization process often results in design modifications that compromise the optimality of the design. While multi-axis AM enhances manufacturability by enabling flexible material deposition in multiple orientations, challenges remain in addressing overhang structures, potential collisions, and material anisotropy caused by varying build orientations. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a novel space-time topology optimization framework for multi-axis AM. The framework employs a pseudo-time field as a design variable to represent the fabrication sequence, simultaneously optimizing the density distribution and build orientations. This approach ensures that the overhang angles remain within manufacturable limits while also mitigating collisions. Moreover, by incorporating material anisotropy induced by diverse build orientations into the design process, the framework can take the scan path-dependent structural behaviors into account during the design optimization. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively derives feasible and optimal designs that account for the manufacturing characteristics of multi-axis AM.</p></details> | 27 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20341v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning algorithms typically necessitate extensive exploration of the state space to find optimal policies. However, in safety-critical applications, the risks associated with such exploration can lead to catastrophic consequences. Existing safe exploration methods attempt to mitigate this by imposing constraints, which often result in overly conservative behaviours and inefficient learning. Heavy penalties for early constraint violations can trap agents in local optima, deterring exploration of risky yet high-reward regions of the state space. To address this, we introduce a method that explicitly learns state-conditioned safety representations. By augmenting the state features with these safety representations, our approach naturally encourages safer exploration without being excessively cautious, resulting in more efficient and safer policy learning in safety-critical scenarios. Empirical evaluations across diverse environments show that our method significantly improves task performance while reducing constraint violations during training, underscoring its effectiveness in balancing exploration with safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2025</p></details> |

However, translating these guidelines into automated clinical decision support systems risks inaccuracy and importantly, loss of nuance. We share an application architecture, the Large Language Expert (LLE), that combines the flexibility and power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the interpretability, explainability, and reliability of Expert Systems. LLMs help address key challenges of Expert Systems, such as integrating and codifying knowledge, and data normalization. Conversely, an Expert System-like approach helps overcome challenges with LLMs, including hallucinations, atomic and inexpensive updates, and testability. To highlight the power of the Large Language Expert (LLE) system, we built an LLE to assist with the workup of patients newly diagnosed with cancer. Timely initiation of cancer treatment is critical for optimal patient outcomes. However, increasing complexity in diagnostic recommendations has made it difficult for primary care physicians to ensure their patients have completed the necessary workup before their first visit with an oncologist. As with many real-world clinical tasks, these workups require the analysis of unstructured health records and the application of nuanced clinical decision logic. In this study, we describe the design & evaluation of an LLE system built to rapidly identify and suggest the correct diagnostic workup. The system demonstrated a high degree of clinical-level accuracy (>95%) and effectively addressed gaps identified in real-world data from breast and colon cancer patients at a large academic center.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In these applications, video cameras and sensors offload inference tasks like license plate recognition and vehicle tracking to remote servers due to local computing and energy constraints. However, legacy network solutions, designed primarily for human-centric applications, struggle to reliably support these MCAs, which demand heterogeneous and fluctuating QoS (due to diverse application inference tasks), further challenged by dynamic wireless network conditions and limited spectrum resources. To tackle these challenges, we propose an Application Context-aware Cross-layer Optimization and Resource Design (ACCORD) framework. This innovative framework anticipates the evolving demands of MCAs in real time, quickly adapting to provide customized QoS and optimal performance, even for the most dynamic and unpredictable MCAs. This also leads to improved network resource management and spectrum utilization. ACCORD operates as a closed feedback-loop system between the application client and network and consists of two key components: (1) Building Application Context: It focuses on understanding the specific context of MCA requirements. Contextual factors include device capabilities, user behavior (e.g., mobility speed), and network channel conditions. (2) Cross-layer Network Parameter Configuration: Utilizing a DRL approach, this component leverages the contextual information to optimize network configuration parameters across various layers, including PHY, MAC, and RLC, as well as the application layer, to meet the desired QoS requirement in real-time. Extensive evaluation with the 3GPP-compliant MATLAB 5G toolbox demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed ACCORD framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications at ICC 2025</p></details> |

Recently, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS, we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE for publication</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty Herding: One Active Learning Method for All Label Budgets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20644v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most active learning research has focused on methods which perform well when many labels are available, but can be dramatically worse than random selection when label budgets are small. Other methods have focused on the low-budget regime, but do poorly as label budgets increase. As the line between "low" and "high" budgets varies by problem, this is a serious issue in practice. We propose uncertainty coverage, an objective which generalizes a variety of low- and high-budget objectives, as well as natural, hyperparameter-light methods to smoothly interpolate between low- and high-budget regimes. We call greedy optimization of the estimate Uncertainty Herding; this simple method is computationally fast, and we prove that it nearly optimizes the distribution-level coverage. In experimental validation across a variety of active learning tasks, our proposal matches or beats state-of-the-art performance in essentially all cases; it is the only method of which we are aware that reliably works well in both low- and high-budget settings.</p></details> | Accepted to ICLR2025 |

However, their reliance on well-prepared tools limits their applicability in the medical domain, which requires to train specialized models. In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We present M3Builder, a novel multi-agent system designed to automate machine learning (ML) in medical imaging. At its core, M3Builder employs four specialized agents that collaborate to tackle complex, multi-step medical ML workflows, from automated data processing and environment configuration to self-contained auto debugging and model training. These agents operate within a medical imaging ML workspace, a structured environment designed to provide agents with free-text descriptions of datasets, training codes, and interaction tools, enabling seamless communication and task execution. (ii) To evaluate progress in automated medical imaging ML, we propose M3Bench, a benchmark comprising four general tasks on 14 training datasets, across five anatomies and three imaging modalities, covering both 2D and 3D data. (iii) We experiment with seven state-of-the-art large language models serving as agent cores for our system, such as Claude series, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3. Compared to existing ML agentic designs, M3Builder shows superior performance on completing ML tasks in medical imaging, achieving a 94.29% success rate using Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the agent core, showing huge potential towards fully automated machine learning in medical imaging.</p></details> | 38 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Mitigating the Backdoor Effect for Multi-Task Model Merging via Safety-Aware Subspace](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13910v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging has gained significant attention as a cost-effective approach to integrate multiple single-task fine-tuned models into a unified one that can perform well on multiple tasks. However, existing model merging techniques primarily focus on resolving conflicts between task-specific models, they often overlook potential security threats, particularly the risk of backdoor attacks in the open-source model ecosystem. In this paper, we first investigate the vulnerabilities of existing model merging methods to backdoor attacks, identifying two critical challenges: backdoor succession and backdoor transfer. To address these issues, we propose a novel Defense-Aware Merging (DAM) approach that simultaneously mitigates task interference and backdoor vulnerabilities. Specifically, DAM employs a meta-learning-based optimization method with dual masks to identify a shared and safety-aware subspace for model merging. These masks are alternately optimized: the Task-Shared mask identifies common beneficial parameters across tasks, aiming to preserve task-specific knowledge while reducing interference, while the Backdoor-Detection mask isolates potentially harmful parameters to neutralize security threats. This dual-mask design allows us to carefully balance the preservation of useful knowledge and the removal of potential vulnerabilities. Compared to existing merging methods, DAM achieves a more favorable balance between performance and security, reducing the attack success rate by 2-10 percentage points while sacrificing only about 1% in accuracy. Furthermore, DAM exhibits robust performance and broad applicability across various types of backdoor attacks and the number of compromised models involved in the merging process. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/Yangjinluan/DAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>arxiv...</summary><p>arxiv version of ICLR2025</p></details> |

In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first four authors contributed equally, 27 pages</p></details> |
| **[Sequence Graph Network for Online Debate Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18696v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online debates involve a dynamic exchange of ideas over time, where participants need to actively consider their opponents' arguments, respond with counterarguments, reinforce their own points, and introduce more compelling arguments as the discussion unfolds. Modeling such a complex process is not a simple task, as it necessitates the incorporation of both sequential characteristics and the capability to capture interactions effectively. To address this challenge, we employ a sequence-graph approach. Building the conversation as a graph allows us to effectively model interactions between participants through directed edges. Simultaneously, the propagation of information along these edges in a sequential manner enables us to capture a more comprehensive representation of context. We also introduce a Sequence Graph Attention layer to illustrate the proposed information update scheme. The experimental results show that sequence graph networks achieve superior results to existing methods in online debates.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional retrieval models such as BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), efficiently retrieve from large corpora but often lack semantic depth. Generative models like GPT-4-o provide richer contextual understanding but face challenges in maintaining factual consistency. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-based, generation-based, and hybrid models, with a primary focus on their performance in ODQA and related retrieval-augmented tasks. Our results show that dense retrievers, particularly DPR, achieve strong performance in ODQA with a top-1 accuracy of 50.17\% on NQ, while hybrid models improve nDCG@10 scores on BEIR from 43.42 (BM25) to 52.59, demonstrating their strength in document reranking. Additionally, we analyze language modeling tasks using WikiText-103, showing that retrieval-based approaches like BM25 achieve lower perplexity compared to generative and hybrid methods, highlighting their utility in retrieval-augmented generation. By providing detailed comparisons and practical insights into the conditions where each approach excels, we aim to facilitate future optimizations in retrieval, reranking, and generative models for ODQA and related knowledge-intensive applications.</p></details> | work on progress |

In this paper, we leverage the self-attention features from pretrained diffusion networks to transfer the visual characteristics from a reference to generated images. Unlike previous work that uses these features as plug-and-play attributes, we propose a novel attention distillation loss calculated between the ideal and current stylization results, based on which we optimize the synthesized image via backpropagation in latent space. Next, we propose an improved Classifier Guidance that integrates attention distillation loss into the denoising sampling process, further accelerating the synthesis and enabling a broad range of image generation applications. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the extraordinary performance of our approach in transferring the examples' style, appearance, and texture to new images in synthesis.

Despite user training and the use of detection techniques, these attacks are still highly effective. Recent studies show that it is user inattentiveness, rather than lack of education, that is one of the key factors in successful phishing attacks. To this end, we develop a novel phishing defense mechanism based on URL inspection tasks: small challenges (loosely inspired by CAPTCHAs) that, to be solved, require users to interact with, and understand, the basic URL structure. We implemented and evaluated three tasks that act as ``barriers'' to visiting the website: (1) correct click-selection from a list of URLs, (2) mouse-based highlighting of the domain-name URL component, and (3) re-typing the domain-name. These tasks follow best practices in security interfaces and warning design. We assessed the efficacy of these tasks through an extensive on-line user study with 2,673 participants from three different cultures, native languages, and alphabets. Results show that these tasks significantly decrease the rate of successful phishing attempts, compared to the baseline case. Results also showed the highest efficacy for difficult URLs, such as typo-squats, with which participants struggled the most. This highlights the importance of (1) slowing down users while focusing their attention and (2) helping them understand the URL structure (especially, the domain-name component thereof) and matching it to their intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |

Although deep learning has achieved remarkable progress in medical image analysis, traditional DME diagnosis still relies on extensive annotated data and subjective ophthalmologist assessments, limiting practical applications. To address this, we present RURANET++, an unsupervised learning-based automated DME diagnostic system. This framework incorporates an optimized U-Net architecture with embedded Spatial and Channel Squeeze & Excitation (SCSE) attention mechanisms to enhance lesion feature extraction. During feature processing, a pre-trained GoogLeNet model extracts deep features from retinal images, followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction to 50 dimensions for computational efficiency. Notably, we introduce a novel clustering algorithm employing multi-projection heads to explicitly control cluster diversity while dynamically adjusting similarity thresholds, thereby optimizing intra-class consistency and inter-class discrimination. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across multiple metrics, achieving maximum accuracy (0.8411), precision (0.8593), recall (0.8411), and F1-score (0.8390), with exceptional clustering quality. This work provides an efficient unsupervised solution for DME diagnosis with significant clinical implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, submitted to The 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025)</p></details> |

To address this shortcoming, we present Avat3r, which regresses a high-quality and animatable 3D head avatar from just a few input images, vastly reducing compute requirements during inference. More specifically, we make Large Reconstruction Models animatable and learn a powerful prior over 3D human heads from a large multi-view video dataset. For better 3D head reconstructions, we employ position maps from DUSt3R and generalized feature maps from the human foundation model Sapiens. To animate the 3D head, our key discovery is that simple cross-attention to an expression code is already sufficient. Finally, we increase robustness by feeding input images with different expressions to our model during training, enabling the reconstruction of 3D head avatars from inconsistent inputs, e.g., an imperfect phone capture with accidental movement, or frames from a monocular video. We compare Avat3r with current state-of-the-art methods for few-input and single-input scenarios, and find that our method has a competitive advantage in both tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed model, creating 3D head avatars from images of different sources, smartphone captures, single images, and even out-of-domain inputs like antique busts.

While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 20XX IEEE.

However, traditional retrieve-and-generate processes may not be optimized for real-world scenarios, where queries might require multiple retrieval steps or none at all. In this paper, we propose a Probing-RAG, which utilizes the hidden state representations from the intermediate layers of language models to adaptively determine the necessity of additional retrievals for a given query. By employing a pre-trained prober, Probing-RAG effectively captures the model's internal cognition, enabling reliable decision-making about retrieving external documents. Experimental results across five open-domain QA datasets demonstrate that Probing-RAG outperforms previous methods while reducing the number of redundant retrieval steps.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |

These networks are composed of payment channels that carry transactions between pairs of users. Due to its design, a payment channel cannot sustain a net flow of money in either direction indefinitely. Therefore, a payment channel network cannot serve transaction requests arbitrarily over a long period of time. We introduce \emph{DEBT control}, a joint routing and flow-control protocol that guides a payment channel network towards an optimal operating state for any steady-state demand. In this protocol, each channel sets a price for routing transactions through it. Transacting users make flow-control and routing decisions by responding to these prices. A channel updates its price based on the net flow of money through it. The protocol is developed by formulating a network utility maximization problem and solving its dual through gradient descent. We provide convergence guarantees for the protocol and also illustrate its behavior through simulations.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

This design choice, rooted in the 1980s technology, may not be optimal today, and it is certainly not the easiest pipeline for education. This paper examines more straightforward pipeline organizations for RISC processors that are suitable for educational purposes and for implementing embedded processors in FPGAs and ASICs. We analyze resource costs and maximum clock frequency of various designs implemented in an FPGA, using clock frequency as a performance proxy. Additionally, we validate these results with ASIC designs synthesized using the open-source SkyWater130 process. Contradictory to common wisdom, a longer pipeline (up to 5 stages) does not necessarily always increase the maximum clock frequency. In two FPGA and one ASIC implementation, we discovered that a four- or five-stage pipeline leads to a slower clock frequency than a three-stage implementation. The reason is that the width of the forwarding multiplexer in the execution stage increases with longer pipelines, which is on the critical path. We also argue that a 3-stage pipeline organization is more adequate for teaching a pipeline organization of a microprocessor.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

Being trapped in these low-capacity states can be a major obstacle to training across many scenarios where deep learning technology is applied. We first prove two concrete mechanisms through which symmetries lead to reduced capacities and ignored features during training and inference. We then propose a simple and theoretically justified algorithm, syre, to remove almost all symmetry-induced low-capacity states in neural networks. When this type of entrapment is especially a concern, removing symmetries with the proposed method is shown to correlate well with improved optimization or performance. A remarkable merit of the proposed method is that it is model-agnostic and does not require any knowledge of the symmetry.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Computing Inconsistency Measures Under Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11009v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing data quality is crucial to knowing whether and how to use the data for different purposes. Specifically, given a collection of integrity constraints, various ways have been proposed to quantify the inconsistency of a database. Inconsistency measures are particularly important when we wish to assess the quality of private data without revealing sensitive information. We study the estimation of inconsistency measures for a database protected under Differential Privacy (DP). Such estimation is nontrivial since some measures intrinsically query sensitive information, and the computation of others involves functions on underlying sensitive data. Among five inconsistency measures that have been proposed in recent work, we identify that two are intractable in the DP setting. The major challenge for the other three is high sensitivity: adding or removing one tuple from the dataset may significantly affect the outcome. To mitigate that, we model the dataset using a conflict graph and investigate private graph statistics to estimate these measures. The proposed machinery includes adapting graph-projection techniques with parameter selection optimizations on the conflict graph and a DP variant of approximate vertex cover size. We experimentally show that we can effectively compute DP estimates of the three measures on five real-world datasets with denial constraints, where the density of the conflict graphs highly varies.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures, SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |

However, the scarcity of large-scale driving datasets has hindered the development of robust and generalizable motion prediction models, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions and road geometries. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained significant attention in the motion prediction community for learning rich and transferable scene representations. Nonetheless, existing pre-training methods for motion prediction have largely focused on specific model architectures and single dataset, limiting their scalability and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose SmartPretrain, a general and scalable SSL framework for motion prediction that is both model-agnostic and dataset-agnostic. Our approach integrates contrastive and reconstructive SSL, leveraging the strengths of both generative and discriminative paradigms to effectively represent spatiotemporal evolution and interactions without imposing architectural constraints. Additionally, SmartPretrain employs a dataset-agnostic scenario sampling strategy that integrates multiple datasets, enhancing data volume, diversity, and robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SmartPretrain consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art prediction models across datasets, data splits and main metrics. For instance, SmartPretrain significantly reduces the MissRate of Forecast-MAE by 10.6%. These results highlight SmartPretrain's effectiveness as a unified, scalable solution for motion prediction, breaking free from the limitations of the small-data regime.

While conventional phase equilibrium calculations typically use pressure-temperature-mole number (PTN) specifications, the UVN formulation is essential for dynamic simulations of closed systems and energy balance computations. Existing approaches, including those based on iterative pressure-temperature updates and direct entropy maximization, suffer from computational inefficiencies due to nested iterations and reliance on inner Newton solvers. In this work, we present a novel reformulation of the UVN-flash problem as a direct entropy maximization problem that eliminates the need for inner Newton iterations, addressing key computational bottlenecks. We derive two new novel formulations: 1) a formulation based on entropy and internal energy and (2) an alternative formulation based on Helmholtz free energy. We begin with a stability analysis framework, followed by a reformulation of the UVN flash problem in natural variables. We then introduce our novel approach and discuss the numerical methods used, including gradient and Hessian computations. The proposed method is validated against benchmark cases, demonstrating improved efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 17 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Guided Annealing for Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20162v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain Generalization (DG) research has gained considerable traction as of late, since the ability to generalize to unseen data distributions is a requirement that eludes even state-of-the-art training algorithms. In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, when combined with previously proposed domain-generalization algorithms it is able to consistently improve their effectiveness by significant margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in CVPR2025</p></details> |
| **[Balanced Rate-Distortion Optimization in Learned Image Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20161v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned image compression (LIC) using deep learning architectures has seen significant advancements, yet standard rate-distortion (R-D) optimization often encounters imbalanced updates due to diverse gradients of the rate and distortion objectives. This imbalance can lead to suboptimal optimization, where one objective dominates, thereby reducing overall compression efficiency. To address this challenge, we reformulate R-D optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and introduce two balanced R-D optimization strategies that adaptively adjust gradient updates to achieve more equitable improvements in both rate and distortion. The first proposed strategy utilizes a coarse-to-fine gradient descent approach along standard R-D optimization trajectories, making it particularly suitable for training LIC models from scratch. The second proposed strategy analytically addresses the reformulated optimization as a quadratic programming problem with an equality constraint, which is ideal for fine-tuning existing models. Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed methods enhance the R-D performance of LIC models, achieving around a 2\% BD-Rate reduction with acceptable additional training cost, leading to a more balanced and efficient optimization process. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version. Camera ready version and source code will be uploaded later.

| **[LongAttn: Selecting Long-context Training Data via Token-level Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16860v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing need for significant advancements in handling long contexts. To enhance long-context capabilities, constructing high-quality training data with long-range dependencies is crucial. Existing methods to select long-context data often rely on sentence-level analysis, which can be greatly optimized in both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel token-level framework, LongAttn, which leverages the self-attention mechanism of LLMs to measure the long-range dependencies for the data. By calculating token-level dependency strength and distribution uniformity of token scores, LongAttn effectively quantifies long-range dependencies, enabling more accurate and efficient data selection. We filter LongABC-32K from open-source long-context datasets (ArXiv, Book, and Code). Through our comprehensive experiments, LongAttn has demonstrated its excellent effectiveness, scalability, and efficiency. To facilitate future research in long-context data, we released our code and the high-quality long-context training data LongABC-32K.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Recent advances in domain generalization improve model transferability in terms of aggregated performance measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC). However, clinical regulations often require to control the transferability of other metrics, such as prescribed sensitivity levels. We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Validated across multiple cohorts and tasks, our method enables robust sensitivity control with only a handful of calibration samples, providing a practical solution for reliable deployment of computational pathology systems.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Your contrastive learning problem is secretly a distribution alignment problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20141v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of contrastive learning (CL) in vision and language, its theoretical foundations and mechanisms for building representations remain poorly understood. In this work, we build connections between noise contrastive estimation losses widely used in CL and distribution alignment with entropic optimal transport (OT). This connection allows us to develop a family of different losses and multistep iterative variants for existing CL methods. Intuitively, by using more information from the distribution of latents, our approach allows a more distribution-aware manipulation of the relationships within augmented sample sets. We provide theoretical insights and experimental evidence demonstrating the benefits of our approach for {\em generalized contrastive alignment}. Through this framework, it is possible to leverage tools in OT to build unbalanced losses to handle noisy views and customize the representation space by changing the constraints on alignment. By reframing contrastive learning as an alignment problem and leveraging existing optimization tools for OT, our work provides new insights and connections between different self-supervised learning models in addition to new tools that can be more easily adapted to incorporate domain knowledge into learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, NeurIPS 2024 submission, includes supplementary material</p></details> |
| **[Educator Attention: How computational tools can systematically identify the distribution of a key resource for students](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20135v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Educator attention is critical for student success, yet how educators distribute their attention across students remains poorly understood due to data and methodological constraints. This study presents the first large-scale computational analysis of educator attention patterns, leveraging over 1 million educator utterances from virtual group tutoring sessions linked to detailed student demographic and academic achievement data. Using natural language processing techniques, we systematically examine the recipient and nature of educator attention. Our findings reveal that educators often provide more attention to lower-achieving students. However, disparities emerge across demographic lines, particularly by gender. Girls tend to receive less attention when paired with boys, even when they are the lower achieving student in the group. Lower-achieving female students in mixed-gender pairs receive significantly less attention than their higher-achieving male peers, while lower-achieving male students receive significantly and substantially more attention than their higher-achieving female peers. We also find some differences by race and English learner (EL) status, with low-achieving Black students receiving additional attention only when paired with another Black student but not when paired with a non-Black peer. In contrast, higher-achieving EL students receive disproportionately more attention than their lower-achieving EL peers. This work highlights how large-scale interaction data and computational methods can uncover subtle but meaningful disparities in teaching practices, providing empirical insights to inform more equitable and effective educational strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors QZ and REW contributed equally.

| **[BoA: Attention-aware Post-training Quantization without Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13474v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices. Early methods developed for smaller networks like ResNet rely on gradient-based optimization, which becomes impractical for hyper-scale LLMs with billions of parameters. While recently proposed backpropagation-free or transformation-based methods alleviate this issue, their performance remains limited by either a lack of inter-layer dependency consideration or the use of naive nearest-rounding-based integer weight assignment to save the heavy computational cost of weight optimization. We thus introduce a novel backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that optimizes integer weights by considering inter-layer dependencies. The key innovation is the development of attention-aware Hessian matrices that capture inter-layer interactions within the attention module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms existing weight quantization methods but also shows good synergy with conventional methods to suppress activation outliers, leading to state-of-the-art weight-activation quantization performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, under review</p></details> |
| **[Regional climate projections using a deep learning--based model-ranking and downscaling framework: Application to European climate zones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20132v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate regional climate forecast calls for high-resolution downscaling of Global Climate Models (GCMs). This work presents a deep-learning-based multi-model evaluation and downscaling framework ranking 32 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS (DL-TOPSIS) mechanism and so refines outputs using advanced deep-learning models. Using nine performance criteria, five K\"oppen-Geiger climate zones -- Tropical, Arid, Temperate, Continental, and Polar -- are investigated over four seasons. While TaiESM1 and CMCC-CM2-SR5 show notable biases, ranking results show that NorESM2-LM, GISS-E2-1-G, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL outperform other models. Four models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\circ}$ resolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer with Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx, TNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.57$^{\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20\% over ConvLSTM. CNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds fine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult. These results confirm that multi-criteria ranking improves GCM selection for regional climate studies and transformer-based downscaling exceeds conventional deep-learning methods. This framework offers a scalable method to enhance high-resolution climate projections, benefiting impact assessments and adaptation plans.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Environmental Science and Pollution Research (ESPR) for review</p></details> |
| **[Relation Also Knows: Rethinking the Recall and Editing of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Transformer Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15091v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The storage and recall of factual associations in auto-regressive transformer language models (LMs) have drawn a great deal of attention, inspiring knowledge editing by directly modifying the located model weights. Most editing works achieve knowledge editing under the guidance of existing interpretations of knowledge recall that mainly focus on subject knowledge. However, these interpretations are seriously flawed, neglecting relation information and leading to the over-generalizing problem for editing. In this work, we discover a novel relation-focused perspective to interpret the knowledge recall of transformer LMs during inference and apply it on single knowledge editing to avoid over-generalizing. Experimental results on the dataset supplemented with a new R-Specificity criterion demonstrate that our editing approach significantly alleviates over-generalizing while remaining competitive on other criteria, breaking the domination of subject-focused editing for future research.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |

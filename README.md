| **[ARINAR: Bi-Level Autoregressive Feature-by-Feature Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02883v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing autoregressive (AR) image generative models use a token-by-token generation schema. That is, they predict a per-token probability distribution and sample the next token from that distribution. The main challenge is how to model the complex distribution of high-dimensional tokens. Previous methods either are too simplistic to fit the distribution or result in slow generation speed. Instead of fitting the distribution of the whole tokens, we explore using a AR model to generate each token in a feature-by-feature way, i.e., taking the generated features as input and generating the next feature. Based on that, we propose ARINAR (AR-in-AR), a bi-level AR model. The outer AR layer take previous tokens as input, predicts a condition vector z for the next token. The inner layer, conditional on z, generates features of the next token autoregressively. In this way, the inner layer only needs to model the distribution of a single feature, for example, using a simple Gaussian Mixture Model. On the ImageNet 256x256 image generation task, ARINAR-B with 213M parameters achieves an FID of 2.75, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art MAR-B model (FID=2.31), while five times faster than the latter.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

| **[A New $\sim 5σ$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI DR1 and DES-SN5YR observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02880v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts, $z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$ at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$ shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$ tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 table, 1 figure.

| **[Wikipedia in the Era of LLMs: Evolution and Risks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02879v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Wikipedia, examining the evolution of Wikipedia through existing data and using simulations to explore potential risks. We begin by analyzing page views and article content to study Wikipedia's recent changes and assess the impact of LLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate how LLMs affect various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to Wikipedia, including machine translation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our findings and simulation results reveal that Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs, with an impact of approximately 1%-2% in certain categories. If the machine translation benchmark based on Wikipedia is influenced by LLMs, the scores of the models may become inflated, and the comparative results among models might shift as well. Moreover, the effectiveness of RAG might decrease if the knowledge base becomes polluted by LLM-generated content. While LLMs have not yet fully changed Wikipedia's language and knowledge structures, we believe that our empirical findings signal the need for careful consideration of potential future risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/HSM316/LLM_Wikipedia</p></details> |
| **[DECT-2020 NR Link Distance Performance in Varying Environments: Models and Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24112v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications 2020 New Radio (DECT-2020 NR) has garnered recognition as an alternative for cellular 5G technology in the internet of things industry. This paper presents a study centered around the analysis of the link distance performance in varying environments for DECT-2020 NR. The study extensively examines and analyzes received signal strength indicator and resulting path loss values in comparison with theoretical models, as well as packet success rates (SR) and signal-to-noise ratio against varying distances. The measurements show that with an SR of over 90%, an antenna height of 1.5 m, indoor link distances with a single device-to-device connection with 0 dBm transmission (TX) power can reach over 60 m in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) areas and up to 190 m in LOS areas with smaller -8 dBm TX power. Similarly, for outdoor use cases, link distances of over 600 m can be reached with +19 dBm TX power.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication in EuCAP-2025 conference, 5 pages, 5 figures, and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Can AI writing be salvaged? Mitigating Idiosyncrasies and Improving Human-AI Alignment in the Writing Process through Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14509v5)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. clich\'es, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, building on existing work in automatic editing we evaluated methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.</p></details> | ACM CHI 2025 |
| **[Prompting Generative AI with Interaction-Augmented Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02874v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of generative AI (GenAI) models, including large language models and text-to-image models, has significantly advanced the synergy between humans and AI with not only their outstanding capability but more importantly, the intuitive communication method with text prompts. Though intuitive, text-based instructions suffer from natural languages' ambiguous and redundant nature. To address the issue, researchers have explored augmenting text-based instructions with interactions that facilitate precise and effective human intent expression, such as direct manipulation. However, the design strategy of interaction-augmented instructions lacks systematic investigation, hindering our understanding and application. To provide a panorama of interaction-augmented instructions, we propose a framework to analyze related tools from why, when, who, what, and how interactions are applied to augment text-based instructions. Notably, we identify four purposes for applying interactions, including restricting, expanding, organizing, and refining text instructions. The design paradigms for each purpose are also summarized to benefit future researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to CHI LBW 2025</p></details> |
| **[VOILA: Evaluation of MLLMs For Perceptual Understanding and Analogical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00043v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become a powerful tool for integrating visual and textual information. Despite their exceptional performance on visual understanding benchmarks, measuring their ability to reason abstractly across multiple images remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce VOILA, a large-scale, open-ended, dynamic benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' perceptual understanding and abstract relational reasoning. VOILA employs an analogical mapping approach in the visual domain, requiring models to generate an image that completes an analogy between two given image pairs, reference and application, without relying on predefined choices. Our experiments demonstrate that the analogical reasoning tasks in VOILA present a challenge to MLLMs. Through multi-step analysis, we reveal that current MLLMs struggle to comprehend inter-image relationships and exhibit limited capabilities in high-level relational reasoning. Notably, we observe that performance improves when following a multi-step strategy of least-to-most prompting. Comprehensive evaluations on open-source models and GPT-4o show that on text-based answers, the best accuracy for challenging scenarios is 13% (LLaMa 3.2) and even for simpler tasks is only 29% (GPT-4o), while human performance is significantly higher at 70% across both difficulty levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

| **[Beyond the Lens: Quantifying the Impact of Scientific Documentaries through Amazon Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08705v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engaging the public with science is critical for a well-informed population. A popular method of scientific communication is documentaries. Once released, it can be difficult to assess the impact of such works on a large scale, due to the overhead required for in-depth audience feedback studies. In what follows, we overview our complementary approach to qualitative studies through quantitative impact and sentiment analysis of Amazon reviews for several scientific documentaries. In addition to developing a novel impact category taxonomy for this analysis, we release a dataset containing 1296 human-annotated sentences from 1043 Amazon reviews for six movies created in whole or part by the Advanced Visualization Lab (AVL). This interdisciplinary team is housed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and consists of visualization designers who focus on cinematic presentations of scientific data. Using this data, we train and evaluate several machine learning and large language models, discussing their effectiveness and possible generalizability for documentaries beyond those focused on for this work. Themes are also extracted from our annotated dataset which, along with our large language model analysis, demonstrate a measure of the ability of scientific documentaries to engage with the public.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for WebSci 2025</p></details> |
| **[Modelling pathwise uncertainty of Stochastic Differential Equations samplers via Probabilistic Numerics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03338v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers have been introduced over the past decade as uncertainty-aware numerical integrators. They typically proceed by assuming a functional prior to the ODE solution, which is then queried on a grid to form a posterior distribution over the ODE solution. As the queries span the integration interval, the approximate posterior solution then converges to the true deterministic one. Gaussian ODE filters, in particular, have enjoyed a lot of attention due to their computational efficiency, the simplicity of their implementation, as well as their provable fast convergence rates. In this article, we extend the methodology to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and propose a probabilistic simulator for SDEs. Our approach involves transforming the SDE into a sequence of random ODEs using piecewise differentiable approximations of the Brownian motion. We then apply probabilistic ODE solvers to the individual ODEs, resulting in a pathwise probabilistic solution to the SDE\@. We establish worst-case strong $1.5$ local and $1.0$ global convergence orders for a specific instance of our method. We further show how we can marginalise the Brownian approximations, by incorporating its coefficients as part of the prior ODE model, allowing for computing exact transition densities under our model. Finally, we numerically validate the theoretical findings, showcasing reasonable weak convergence properties in the marginalised version.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, accepted to Bayesian Analysis, to be announced</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation of Architectural Synthesis Using Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02861v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal Generative AI have the potential to democratize specialized architectural tasks, such as interpreting technical drawings and creating 3D CAD models, which traditionally require expert knowledge. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of two systems: GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, in the task of architectural 3D synthesis. We conduct a case study on two buildings from Palladio's Four Books of Architecture (1965): Villa Rotonda and Palazzo Porto. High-level architectural models and drawings of these buildings were prepared, inspired by Palladio's original texts and drawings. Through sequential text and image prompting, we assess the systems' abilities in (1) interpreting 2D and 3D representations of buildings from drawings, (2) encoding the buildings into a CAD software script, and (3) self-improving based on outputs. While both systems successfully generate individual parts, they struggle to accurately assemble these parts into the desired spatial relationships, with Claude 3.5 demonstrating better performance, particularly in self-correcting its output. This study contributes to ongoing research on benchmarking the strengths and weaknesses of off-the-shelf AI systems in performing intelligent human tasks that require discipline-specific knowledge. The findings highlight the potential of language-enabled AI systems to act as collaborative technical assistants in the architectural design process.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Unsupervised Attributed Dynamic Network Embedding with Stability Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02859v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stability for dynamic network embeddings ensures that nodes behaving the same at different times receive the same embedding, allowing comparison of nodes in the network across time. We present attributed unfolded adjacency spectral embedding (AUASE), a stable unsupervised representation learning framework for dynamic networks in which nodes are attributed with time-varying covariate information. To establish stability, we prove uniform convergence to an associated latent position model. We quantify the benefits of our dynamic embedding by comparing with state-of-the-art network representation learning methods on three real attributed networks. To the best of our knowledge, AUASE is the only attributed dynamic embedding that satisfies stability guarantees without the need for ground truth labels, which we demonstrate provides significant improvements for link prediction and node classification.</p></details> | 27 pages, 5 figures |
| **[(How) Do Language Models Track State?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02854v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Exact matching as an alternative to propensity score matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02850v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The comparison of different medical treatments from observational studies or across different clinical studies is often biased by confounding factors such as systematic differences in patient demographics or in the inclusion criteria for the trials. Propensity score matching is a popular method to adjust for such confounding. It compares weighted averages of patient responses. The weights are calculated from logistic regression models with the intention to reduce differences between the confounders in the treatment groups. However, the groups are only "roughly matched" with no generally accepted principle to determine when a match is "good enough". In this manuscript, we propose an alternative approach to the matching problem by considering it as a constrained optimization problem. We investigate the conditions for exact matching in the sense that the average values of confounders are identical in the treatment groups after matching. Our approach is similar to the matching-adjusted indirect comparison approach by Signorovitch et al. (2010) but with two major differences: First, we do not impose any specific functional form on the matching weights; second, the proposed approach can be applied to individual patient data from several treatment groups as well as to a mix of individual patient and aggregated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Deep Learning for Subtype Classification in Breast Cancer Using Histopathological Images and Gene Expression Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02849v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular subtyping of breast cancer is crucial for personalized treatment and prognosis. Traditional classification approaches rely on either histopathological images or gene expression profiling, limiting their predictive power. In this study, we propose a deep multimodal learning framework that integrates histopathological images and gene expression data to classify breast cancer into BRCA.Luminal and BRCA.Basal / Her2 subtypes. Our approach employs a ResNet-50 model for image feature extraction and fully connected layers for gene expression processing, with a cross-attention fusion mechanism to enhance modality interaction. We conduct extensive experiments using five-fold cross-validation, demonstrating that our multimodal integration outperforms unimodal approaches in terms of classification accuracy, precision-recall AUC, and F1-score. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning for robust and interpretable breast cancer subtype classification, paving the way for improved clinical decision-making.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm for Maximum Marginal Likelihood Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13429v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a class of interacting particle systems for implementing a maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) procedure to estimate the parameters of a latent variable model. We achieve this by formulating a continuous-time interacting particle system which can be seen as a Langevin diffusion over an extended state space of parameters and latent variables. In particular, we prove that the parameter marginal of the stationary measure of this diffusion has the form of a Gibbs measure where number of particles acts as the inverse temperature parameter in classical settings for global optimisation. Using a particular rescaling, we then prove geometric ergodicity of this system and bound the discretisation error in a manner that is uniform in time and does not increase with the number of particles. The discretisation results in an algorithm, termed Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithm (IPLA) which can be used for MMLE. We further prove nonasymptotic bounds for the optimisation error of our estimator in terms of key parameters of the problem, and also extend this result to the case of stochastic gradients covering practical scenarios. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the empirical behaviour of our algorithm in the context of logistic regression with verifiable assumptions. Our setting provides a straightforward way to implement a diffusion-based optimisation routine compared to more classical approaches such as the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm, and allows for especially explicit nonasymptotic bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ESAIM: Probability and Statistics</p></details> |
| **[Mask-DPO: Generalizable Fine-grained Factuality Alignment of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02846v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit hallucinations (i.e., unfaithful or nonsensical information) when serving as AI assistants in various domains. Since hallucinations always come with truthful content in the LLM responses, previous factuality alignment methods that conduct response-level preference learning inevitably introduced noises during training. Therefore, this paper proposes a fine-grained factuality alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), called Mask-DPO. Incorporating sentence-level factuality as mask signals, Mask-DPO only learns from factually correct sentences in the preferred samples and prevents the penalty on factual contents in the not preferred samples, which resolves the ambiguity in the preference learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Mask-DPO can significantly improve the factuality of LLMs responses to questions from both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, although these questions and their corresponding topics are unseen during training. Only trained on the ANAH train set, the score of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the ANAH test set is improved from 49.19% to 77.53%, even surpassing the score of Llama3.1-70B-Instruct (53.44%), while its FactScore on the out-of-domain Biography dataset is also improved from 30.29% to 39.39%. We further study the generalization property of Mask-DPO using different training sample scaling strategies and find that scaling the number of topics in the dataset is more effective than the number of questions. We provide a hypothesis of what factual alignment is doing with LLMs, on the implication of this phenomenon, and conduct proof-of-concept experiments to verify it. We hope the method and the findings pave the way for future research on scaling factuality alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025.

| **[LABIIUM: AI-Enhanced Zero-configuration Measurement Automation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16172v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify instrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE I2MTC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Layer Swapping for Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01335v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging, such as model souping, is the practice of combining different models with the same architecture together without further training. In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, Spotlight Paper, In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2025</p></details> |

The improvement of the capabilities of such an agent is highly dependent on the availability of relevant training environments. In order to facilitate the development of such systems, we introduce a novel simulation environment (built on top of robosuite) that makes use of the MuJoCo physics engine and high-quality renderer Blender to provide realistic visual observations that are also accurate to the physical state of the scene. It is the first simulator focusing on long-horizon robot manipulation tasks preserving accurate physics modeling. MuBlE can generate mutlimodal data for training and enable design of closed-loop methods through environment interaction on two levels: visual - action loop, and control - physics loop. Together with the simulator, we propose SHOP-VRB2, a new benchmark composed of 10 classes of multi-step reasoning scenarios that require simultaneous visual and physical measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/michaal94/MuBlE. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2404.15194</p></details> |
| **[The Shift from Writing to Pruning Software: A Bonsai-Inspired IDE for Reshaping AI Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02833v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI-driven coding assistants signals a fundamental shift in how software is built. While AI coding assistants have been integrated into existing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), their full potential remains largely untapped. A key challenge is that these AI assistants can suffer from hallucinations, leading developers down decision paths that the AI should not dictate, sometimes even without the users awareness or consent. Moreover, current static-file IDEs lack the mechanisms to address critical issues such as tracking the provenance of AI-generated code and integrating version control in a way that aligns with the dynamic nature of AI-assisted development. As a result, developers are left without the necessary tools to manage, refine, and validate AI generated code systematically, making it difficult to ensure correctness, maintainability, and trust in the development process. Existing IDEs treat AI-generated code as static text, offering limited support for managing its evolution, refinement, or multiple alternative paths. Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused on balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to IDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free from traditional file structures. This approach fosters a more fluid and interactive method for code evolution. We introduce the concept of a Bonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and multiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit their needs. Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model toward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of generated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather than merely serving as a place to write and edit code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop</p></details> |
| **[AlignDistil: Token-Level Language Model Alignment as Adaptive Policy Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02832v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Decentralized Adversarial Training over Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13326v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks has been attracting considerable attention in recent years. Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of distributed learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. Specifically, we devise two decentralized adversarial training algorithms by relying on two popular decentralized learning strategies--diffusion and consensus. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed framework for strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.01936</p></details> |
| **[Developing a PET/CT Foundation Model for Cross-Modal Anatomical and Functional Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02824v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In oncology, Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET/CT) is widely used in cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment monitoring, as it combines anatomical details from CT with functional metabolic activity and molecular marker expression information from PET. However, existing artificial intelligence-driven PET/CT analyses rely predominantly on task-specific models trained from scratch or on limited datasets, limiting their generalizability and robustness. To address this, we propose a foundation model approach specifically designed for multimodal PET/CT imaging. We introduce the Cross-Fraternal Twin Masked Autoencoder (FratMAE), a novel framework that effectively integrates whole-body anatomical and functional or molecular information. FratMAE employs separate Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders for PET and CT scans, along with cross-attention decoders that enable synergistic interactions between modalities during masked autoencoder training. Additionally, it incorporates textual metadata to enhance PET representation learning. By pre-training on PET/CT datasets, FratMAE captures intricate cross-modal relationships and global uptake patterns, achieving superior performance on downstream tasks and demonstrating its potential as a generalizable foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This article explores multimodal generative models capable of converting taste information into music, building on this foundational research. We provide a brief review of the state of the art in this field, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We present an experiment in which a fine-tuned version of a generative music model (MusicGEN) is used to generate music based on detailed taste descriptions provided for each musical piece. The results are promising: according the participants' ($n=111$) evaluation, the fine-tuned model produces music that more coherently reflects the input taste descriptions compared to the non-fine-tuned model. This study represents a significant step towards understanding and developing embodied interactions between AI, sound, and taste, opening new possibilities in the field of generative AI.

Open Source Software Licenses (OSS licenses) ensure that software can be sold or distributed as part of aggregate programs from various sources without requiring a royalty or fee. The quality of such code rivals that of commercial software, with open source libraries forming large parts of the supply chain for critical commercial systems in industry. Despite this, most open source projects rely on volunteer contributions, and unpaid library maintainers face significant pressure to sustain their projects. One potential solution for these projects is to change their licensing to ensure that maintainers are compensated accordingly for their work. In this paper, we explore the potential of licensing to help alleviate funding issues, with a review of three different cases where OSS licenses were modified to allow for monetization. In addition, we explore licensing concerns related to the emergence of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in software development. We argue that open source is at a crossroads, with a growing need to redefine its licensing models and support communities and critical software. We identify specific research opportunities and conclude with a research agenda comprising a series of research questions to guide future studies in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop</p></details> |

Their computational complexity has been actively studied and is tightly connected to topological quantum computing. In this article, we prove that for any 3-manifold quantum invariant in the Reshetikhin-Turaev model, there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given as input an arbitrary closed 3-manifold $M$, outputs a closed 3-manifold $M'$ with same quantum invariant, such that $M'$ is hyperbolic, contains no low genus embedded incompressible surface, and is presented by a strongly irreducible Heegaard diagram. Our construction relies on properties of Heegaard splittings and the Hempel distance. At the level of computational complexity, this proves that the hardness of computing a given quantum invariant of 3-manifolds is preserved even when severely restricting the topology and the combinatorics of the input. This positively answers a question raised by Samperton.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

The particle method couples a geometrically-exact treatment of advection; Wasserstein gradient-flow dynamics; and a Kullback-Leibler representation of the entropy. General boundary conditions are enforced by introducing an adsorption/depletion layer at the boundary wherein particles are added or removed as dictated by the boundary conditions. We demonstrate the range and scope of the method through a number of examples of application, including absorption of particles into a sphere and flow through pipes of square and circular cross section, with and without occlusions. In all cases, the solution is observed to converge weakly, or in the sense of local averages.</p></details> | 26 pages, 16 figures |
| **[A Minimalist Example of Edge-of-Stability and Progressive Sharpening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02809v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning optimization have unveiled two intriguing phenomena under large learning rates: Edge of Stability (EoS) and Progressive Sharpening (PS), challenging classical Gradient Descent (GD) analyses. Current research approaches, using either generalist frameworks or minimalist examples, face significant limitations in explaining these phenomena. This paper advances the minimalist approach by introducing a two-layer network with a two-dimensional input, where one dimension is relevant to the response and the other is irrelevant. Through this model, we rigorously prove the existence of progressive sharpening and self-stabilization under large learning rates, and establish non-asymptotic analysis of the training dynamics and sharpness along the entire GD trajectory. Besides, we connect our minimalist example to existing works by reconciling the existence of a well-behaved ``stable set" between minimalist and generalist analyses, and extending the analysis of Gradient Flow Solution sharpness to our two-dimensional input scenario. These findings provide new insights into the EoS phenomenon from both parameter and input data distribution perspectives, potentially informing more effective optimization strategies in deep learning practice.</p></details> | 39 pages, 15 figures |

However, current approaches are typically data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistically sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark-Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities-which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. Our benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We leverage LAMBDA to benchmark current end-to-end learning methods and a modular neuro-symbolic approaches that combines foundation models with task and motion planning. We find that end-to-end methods-even when pretrained-yield lower success rates, while neuro-symbolic methods perform significantly better and require less data.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Semantic Volume: Quantifying and Detecting both External and Internal Uncertainty in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21239v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks by encoding vast amounts of factual knowledge. However, they are still prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or misleading information, often accompanied by high uncertainty. Existing methods for hallucination detection primarily focus on quantifying internal uncertainty, which arises from missing or conflicting knowledge within the model. However, hallucinations can also stem from external uncertainty, where ambiguous user queries lead to multiple possible interpretations. In this work, we introduce Semantic Volume, a novel mathematical measure for quantifying both external and internal uncertainty in LLMs. Our approach perturbs queries and responses, embeds them in a semantic space, and computes the determinant of the Gram matrix of the embedding vectors, capturing their dispersion as a measure of uncertainty. Our framework provides a generalizable and unsupervised uncertainty detection method without requiring white-box access to LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on both external and internal uncertainty detection, demonstrating that our Semantic Volume method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both tasks. Additionally, we provide theoretical insights linking our measure to differential entropy, unifying and extending previous sampling-based uncertainty measures such as the semantic entropy. Semantic Volume is shown to be a robust and interpretable approach to improving the reliability of LLMs by systematically detecting uncertainty in both user queries and model responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper needs approval from Amazon for open resource release</p></details> |

Whereas existing literature often resolves confounding by removing confounder-related information from latent representations, this strategy risks affecting image reconstruction quality in generative models, thus limiting their applicability in feature visualization. To tackle this, we propose a different strategy that retains confounder-related information in latent representations while finding an alternative confounder-free representation of the image data. Our approach views the latent space of an autoencoder as a vector space, where imaging-related variables, such as the learning target (t) and confounder (c), have a vector capturing their variability. The confounding problem is addressed by searching a confounder-free vector which is orthogonal to the confounder-related vector but maximally collinear to the target-related vector. To achieve this, we introduce a novel correlation-based loss that not only performs vector searching in the latent space, but also encourages the encoder to generate latent representations linearly correlated with the variables. Subsequently, we interpret the confounder-free representation by sampling and reconstructing images along the confounder-free vector. The efficacy and flexibility of our proposed method are demonstrated across three applications, accommodating multiple confounders and utilizing diverse image modalities. Results affirm the method's effectiveness in reducing confounder influences, preventing wrong or misleading associations, and offering a unique visual interpretation for in-depth investigations by clinical and epidemiological researchers.

Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time series data without requiring fine-tuning on specific datasets. The framework's adaptability mechanism enables it to adjust its understanding of normal operating conditions dynamically, thus increasing detection accuracy. We validate this methodology through a real-world application for a plastics manufacturing plant and the Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). Results show significant improvements over our previous model with an accuracy increase from 70.7 to 89.1 on the real-world dataset. By allowing for the enriching of input series data with semantics, RAAD-LLM incorporates multimodal capabilities that facilitate more collaborative decision-making between the model and plant operators. Overall, our findings support RAAD-LLM's ability to revolutionize anomaly detection methodologies in PdM, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in how anomaly detection is implemented across various industries.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.00914</p></details> |
| **[Spike-and-Slab Posterior Sampling in High Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02798v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Posterior sampling with the spike-and-slab prior [MB88], a popular multimodal distribution used to model uncertainty in variable selection, is considered the theoretical gold standard method for Bayesian sparse linear regression [CPS09, Roc18]. However, designing provable algorithms for performing this sampling task is notoriously challenging. Existing posterior samplers for Bayesian sparse variable selection tasks either require strong assumptions about the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [YWJ16], only work when the measurement count grows at least linearly in the dimension [MW24], or rely on heuristic approximations to the posterior. We give the first provable algorithms for spike-and-slab posterior sampling that apply for any SNR, and use a measurement count sublinear in the problem dimension. Concretely, assume we are given a measurement matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and noisy observations $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{\theta}^\star + \mathbf{\xi}$ of a signal $\mathbf{\theta}^\star$ drawn from a spike-and-slab prior $\pi$ with a Gaussian diffuse density and expected sparsity k, where $\mathbf{\xi} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbb{0}_n, \sigma^2\mathbf{I}_n)$. We give a polynomial-time high-accuracy sampler for the posterior $\pi(\cdot \mid \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{y})$, for any SNR $\sigma^{-1}$ > 0, as long as $n \geq k^3 \cdot \text{polylog}(d)$ and $X$ is drawn from a matrix ensemble satisfying the restricted isometry property. We further give a sampler that runs in near-linear time $\approx nd$ in the same setting, as long as $n \geq k^5 \cdot \text{polylog}(d)$. To demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, we extend our result to spike-and-slab posterior sampling with Laplace diffuse densities, achieving similar guarantees when $\sigma = O(\frac{1}{k})$ is bounded.</p></details> | 53 pages |

Classical model-based approaches often struggle with nonlinearities and unstructured disturbances, while RL-based methods can be fragile when encountering unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Neural Internal Model Control, which integrates model-based control with RL-based control to enhance robustness. Our framework streamlines the predictive model by applying Newton-Euler equations for rigid-body dynamics, eliminating the need to capture complex high-dimensional nonlinearities. This internal model combines model-free RL algorithms with predictive error feedback. Such a design enables a closed-loop control structure to enhance the robustness and generalizability of the control system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both quadrotors and quadrupedal robots, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment on a quadrotor with rope-suspended payloads highlights the framework's robustness in sim-to-real transfer. Our code is released at https://github.com/thu-uav/NeuralIMC.</p></details> | Submitted to RAL |

| **[Modelling pathwise uncertainty of Stochastic Differential Equations samplers via Probabilistic Numerics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03338v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers have been introduced over the past decade as uncertainty-aware numerical integrators. They typically proceed by assuming a functional prior to the ODE solution, which is then queried on a grid to form a posterior distribution over the ODE solution. As the queries span the integration interval, the approximate posterior solution then converges to the true deterministic one. Gaussian ODE filters, in particular, have enjoyed a lot of attention due to their computational efficiency, the simplicity of their implementation, as well as their provable fast convergence rates. In this article, we extend the methodology to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and propose a probabilistic simulator for SDEs. Our approach involves transforming the SDE into a sequence of random ODEs using piecewise differentiable approximations of the Brownian motion. We then apply probabilistic ODE solvers to the individual ODEs, resulting in a pathwise probabilistic solution to the SDE\@. We establish worst-case strong $1.5$ local and $1.0$ global convergence orders for a specific instance of our method. We further show how we can marginalise the Brownian approximations, by incorporating its coefficients as part of the prior ODE model, allowing for computing exact transition densities under our model. Finally, we numerically validate the theoretical findings, showcasing reasonable weak convergence properties in the marginalised version.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, accepted to Bayesian Analysis, to be announced</p></details> |

How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 17 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for IEEE I2MTC 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, Spotlight Paper, In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2025</p></details> |

While AI coding assistants have been integrated into existing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), their full potential remains largely untapped. A key challenge is that these AI assistants can suffer from hallucinations, leading developers down decision paths that the AI should not dictate, sometimes even without the users awareness or consent. Moreover, current static-file IDEs lack the mechanisms to address critical issues such as tracking the provenance of AI-generated code and integrating version control in a way that aligns with the dynamic nature of AI-assisted development. As a result, developers are left without the necessary tools to manage, refine, and validate AI generated code systematically, making it difficult to ensure correctness, maintainability, and trust in the development process. Existing IDEs treat AI-generated code as static text, offering limited support for managing its evolution, refinement, or multiple alternative paths. Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused on balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to IDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free from traditional file structures. This approach fosters a more fluid and interactive method for code evolution. We introduce the concept of a Bonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and multiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit their needs. Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model toward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of generated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather than merely serving as a place to write and edit code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop</p></details> |

Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</p></details> |

However, existing artificial intelligence-driven PET/CT analyses rely predominantly on task-specific models trained from scratch or on limited datasets, limiting their generalizability and robustness. To address this, we propose a foundation model approach specifically designed for multimodal PET/CT imaging. We introduce the Cross-Fraternal Twin Masked Autoencoder (FratMAE), a novel framework that effectively integrates whole-body anatomical and functional or molecular information. FratMAE employs separate Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders for PET and CT scans, along with cross-attention decoders that enable synergistic interactions between modalities during masked autoencoder training. Additionally, it incorporates textual metadata to enhance PET representation learning. By pre-training on PET/CT datasets, FratMAE captures intricate cross-modal relationships and global uptake patterns, achieving superior performance on downstream tasks and demonstrating its potential as a generalizable foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

When using these tools, we are often faced with turning infinite-series expressions into more compact finite series (e.g., the Euler-Rodriques formula), which can sometimes be onerous. In this paper, we identify some useful integral forms in matrix Lie group expressions that offer a more streamlined pathway for computing compact analytic results. Moreover, we present some recursive structures in these integral forms that show many of these expressions are interrelated. Key to our approach is that we are able to apply the minimal polynomial for a Lie algebra quite early in the process to keep expressions compact throughout the derivations. With the series approach, the minimal polynomial is usually applied at the end, making it hard to recognize common analytic expressions in the result. We show that our integral method can reproduce several series-derived results from the literature.</p></details> | 22 pages |

For a long time, the dominant philosophy has been to `reuse as much as possible, without thought for what is being depended upon', resulting in the formation of large dependency supply chains that spread throughout entire software ecosystems. Such heavy reliance on third-party packages has eventually brought forward resilience and maintenance concerns, such as security attacks and outdated dependencies. In this vision paper, we investigate packages that challenge the typical concepts of reuse--that is, packages with no dependencies themselves that bear the responsibility of being at the end of the dependency supply chain. We find that these end-of-chain packages vary in characteristics and not just packages that can be easily replaced: an active, well-maintained package at the end of the chain; a "classical" package that has remained unchanged for 11 years; a trivial package nested deep in the dependency chain; a package that may appear trivial; and a package that bundled up and absorbed its dependencies. The vision of this paper is to advocate for a shift in software development practices toward minimizing reliance on third-party packages, particularly those at the end of dependency supply chains. We argue that these end-of-chain packages offer unique insights, as they play a key role in the ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop</p></details> |

Analyzing VQA datasets is essential for developing robust models that can handle the complexities of multimodal reasoning. Several approaches have been developed to examine these datasets, each offering distinct perspectives on question diversity, answer distribution, and visual-textual correlations. Despite significant progress, existing VQA models face challenges related to dataset bias, limited model complexity, commonsense reasoning gaps, rigid evaluation methods, and generalization to real world scenarios. This paper offers a detailed study of the original VQA dataset, baseline models and methods along with a comparative study of five advanced VQA models, ABC-CNN, KICNLE, Masked Vision and Language Modeling, BLIP-2, and OFA, each employing distinct methods to address these ongoing challenges.</p></details> | 8 pages, No figures |
| **[Undertrained Image Reconstruction for Realistic Degradation in Blind Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02767v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most super-resolution (SR) models struggle with real-world low-resolution (LR) images. This issue arises because the degradation characteristics in the synthetic datasets differ from those in real-world LR images. Since SR models are trained on pairs of high-resolution (HR) and LR images generated by downsampling, they are optimized for simple degradation. However, real-world LR images contain complex degradation caused by factors such as the imaging process and JPEG compression. Due to these differences in degradation characteristics, most SR models perform poorly on real-world LR images. This study proposes a dataset generation method using undertrained image reconstruction models. These models have the property of reconstructing low-quality images with diverse degradation from input images. By leveraging this property, this study generates LR images with diverse degradation from HR images to construct the datasets. Fine-tuning pre-trained SR models on our generated datasets improves noise removal and blur reduction, enhancing performance on real-world LR images. Furthermore, an analysis of the datasets reveals that degradation diversity contributes to performance improvements, whereas color differences between HR and LR images may degrade performance. 11 pages, (11 figures and 2 tables)</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/vila-u.

Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, research paper</p></details> |

Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to hierarchically represent building structures as a program, which can be efficiently converted into a mesh. We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArcPro outperforms both traditional architectural proxy reconstruction and learning-based abstraction methods. We further explore its potential to work with multi-view image and natural language inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Patent Protected); Project page: https://vcc.tech/research/2025/ArcPro</p></details> |

However, a major challenge remains ensuring safe and efficient navigation in environments filled with both dynamic alive (e.g., humans) and dynamic inanimate (e.g., non-living objects) obstacles. In this paper, we propose ImpedanceGPT, a novel system that combines a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enable real-time reasoning for adaptive navigation of mini-drone swarms in complex environments. The key innovation of ImpedanceGPT lies in the integration of VLM and RAG, which provides the drones with enhanced semantic understanding of their surroundings. This enables the system to dynamically adjust impedance control parameters in response to obstacle types and environmental conditions. Our approach not only ensures safe and precise navigation but also improves coordination between drones in the swarm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. The VLM-RAG framework achieved an obstacle detection and retrieval accuracy of 80 % under optimal lighting. In static environments, drones navigated dynamic inanimate obstacles at 1.4 m/s but slowed to 0.7 m/s with increased separation around humans. In dynamic environments, speed adjusted to 1.0 m/s near hard obstacles, while reducing to 0.6 m/s with higher deflection to safely avoid moving humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods such as UniDexGrasp++, which require complex, multi-step training pipelines, UniGraspTransformer follows a streamlined process: first, dedicated policy networks are trained for individual objects using reinforcement learning to generate successful grasp trajectories; then, these trajectories are distilled into a single, universal network. Our approach enables UniGraspTransformer to scale effectively, incorporating up to 12 self-attention blocks for handling thousands of objects with diverse poses. Additionally, it generalizes well to both idealized and real-world inputs, evaluated in state-based and vision-based settings. Notably, UniGraspTransformer generates a broader range of grasping poses for objects in various shapes and orientations, resulting in more diverse grasp strategies. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art, UniDexGrasp++, across various object categories, achieving success rate gains of 3.5%, 7.7%, and 10.1% on seen objects, unseen objects within seen categories, and completely unseen objects, respectively, in the vision-based setting.

Long documents, specifically the scientific documents that are densely packed with knowledge discovered and developed by humans, remain relatively unexplored. These documents often come with a set of complex and more realistic questions, adding to their complexity. We present a zero-shot pipeline framework that enables social science researchers to perform question-answering tasks that are complex yet of predetermined question formats on full-length research papers without requiring machine learning expertise. Our approach integrates pre-trained language models to handle challenging scenarios including multi-span extraction, multi-hop reasoning, and long-answer generation. Evaluating on MLPsych, a novel dataset of social psychology papers with annotated complex questions, we demonstrate that our framework achieves strong performance through combination of extractive and generative models.

| **[TReND: Transformer derived features and Regularized NMF for neonatal functional network Delineation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02685v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise parcellation of functional networks (FNs) of early developing human brain is the fundamental basis for identifying biomarker of developmental disorders and understanding functional development. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) enables in vivo exploration of functional changes, but adult FN parcellations cannot be directly applied to the neonates due to incomplete network maturation. No standardized neonatal functional atlas is currently available. To solve this fundamental issue, we propose TReND, a novel and fully automated self-supervised transformer-autoencoder framework that integrates regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (RNMF) to unveil the FNs in neonates. TReND effectively disentangles spatiotemporal features in voxel-wise rs-fMRI data. The framework integrates confidence-adaptive masks into transformer self-attention layers to mitigate noise influence. A self supervised decoder acts as a regulator to refine the encoder's latent embeddings, which serve as reliable temporal features. For spatial coherence, we incorporate brain surface-based geodesic distances as spatial encodings along with functional connectivity from temporal features. The TReND clustering approach processes these features under sparsity and smoothness constraints, producing robust and biologically plausible parcellations. We extensively validated our TReND framework on three different rs-fMRI datasets: simulated, dHCP and HCP-YA against comparable traditional feature extraction and clustering techniques. Our results demonstrated the superiority of the TReND framework in the delineation of neonate FNs with significantly better spatial contiguity and functional homogeneity. Collectively, we established TReND, a novel and robust framework, for neonatal FN delineation. TReND-derived neonatal FNs could serve as a neonatal functional atlas for perinatal populations in health and disease.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 5 figures |

Rather than designing a single compression matrix as in conventional compressed sensing, structured compressed sensing yields dimension-specific compression matrices, reducing the number of optimizable parameters. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled task-based supervised learning of subsampling matrices, albeit at the expense of complex downstream models. Additionally, the sampling resource allocation across dimensions is often determined in advance through heuristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Structured COmpressed Sensing with Automatic Resource Allocation (SCOSARA) with an information theory-based unsupervised learning strategy. SCOSARA adaptively distributes samples across sampling dimensions while maximizing Fisher information content. Using ultrasound localization as a case study, we compare SCOSARA to state-of-the-art ML-based and greedy search algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that SCOSARA can produce high-quality subsampling matrices that achieve lower Cram\'er-Rao Bound values than the baselines. In addition, SCOSARA outperforms other ML-based algorithms in terms of the number of trainable parameters, computational complexity, and memory requirements while automatically choosing the number of samples per axis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unsup...</summary><p>Unsupervised Learning, Information Theory, Compressed Sensing, Subsampling</p></details> |

However, existing tools do not sufficiently link the data contexts such as schemas and values with the code being edited. This not only leads to poor code suggestions, but also frequent interruptions in coding processes as users need additional code to locate and understand relevant data. We introduce Xavier, a tool designed to enhance data wrangling script authoring in computational notebooks. Xavier maintains users' awareness of data contexts while providing data-aware code suggestions. It automatically highlights the most relevant data based on the user's code, integrates both code and data contexts for more accurate suggestions, and instantly previews data transformation results for easy verification. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of Xavier, we conducted a user study with 16 data analysts, showing its potential to streamline data wrangling scripts authoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

In this paper, we innovatively transform the problem of threat assessment into a reinforcement learning problem, and through systematic reinforcement learning training, we successfully construct an efficient neural network evaluator. The evaluator can not only comprehensively integrate the multidimensional attribute features of the enemy, but also effectively combine our state information, thus realizing a more accurate and scientific threat assessment.</p></details> | 10 pages,9 figures |

Interpolation is modelled as a diffeomorphic transformation using a smooth, time-varying flow field governed by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). This ensures topological consistency and non-intersecting trajectories while accommodating hard constraints, such as volume preservation, and soft constraints, \eg physical priors. Correspondence is recovered using an efficient Varifold formulation, that is effective on high-fidelity surfaces with differing parameterisations. By providing a simple skeleton for the source shape only, we impose physically motivated constraints on the deformation field and resolve symmetric ambiguities. This is achieved without relying on skinning weights or any prior knowledge of the skeleton's target pose configuration. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate competitive or superior performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches in both shape correspondence and interpolation tasks across standard datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs. Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs. Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text). To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens. This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time. Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sony/aki, and we will release our AKI-4B model to encourage further advancements in MLLMs across various directions.</p></details> | Preprint |

We first show that MPPI can be interpreted as performing gradient ascent on a smoothed energy function. We then demonstrate that Policy Gradient methods reduce to MPPI by applying an exponential transformation to the objective function. Additionally, we establish that the reverse sampling process in diffusion models follows the same update rule as MPPI.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>updated RL subsection in Main section</p></details> |

Despite their significance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and published in Findings of EMNLP 2024.

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

However, their memory consumption increases quadratically with input resolution, rendering them impractical for high-resolution images. In this paper, we present MeFlow, a novel memory-efficient method for high-resolution optical flow estimation. The key of MeFlow is a recurrent local orthogonal cost volume representation, which decomposes the 2D search space dynamically into two 1D orthogonal spaces, enabling our method to scale effectively to very high-resolution inputs. To preserve essential information in the orthogonal space, we utilize self attention to propagate feature information from the 2D space to the orthogonal space. We further propose a radius-distribution multi-scale lookup strategy to model the correspondences of large displacements at a negligible cost. We verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our method on the challenging Sintel and KITTI benchmarks, and real-world 4K ($2160\!\times\!3840$) images. Our method achieves competitive performance on both Sintel and KITTI benchmarks, while maintaining the highest memory efficiency on high-resolution inputs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, due to the intrinsic complexity of LLMs, effective prompting is more challenging than it may seem. This highlights the need for innovative educational and support strategies that are both widely accessible and seamlessly integrated into task workflows. Yet, LLM prompting is highly task- and domain-dependent, limiting the effectiveness of generic approaches. In this study, we explore whether LLM-based methods can facilitate learning assessments by using ad-hoc guidelines and a minimal number of annotated prompt samples. Our framework transforms these guidelines into features that can be identified within learners' prompts. Using these feature descriptions and annotated examples, we create few-shot learning detectors. We then evaluate different configurations of these detectors, testing three state-of-the-art LLMs and ensembles. We run experiments with cross-validation on a sample of original prompts, as well as tests on prompts collected from task-naive learners. Our results show how LLMs perform on feature detection. Notably, GPT- 4 demonstrates strong performance on most features, while closely related models, such as GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Turbo (Instruct), show inconsistent behaviors in feature classification. These differences highlight the need for further research into how design choices impact feature selection and prompt detection. Our findings contribute to the fields of generative AI literacy and computer-supported learning assessment, offering valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for Publication in Educational Technology & Society (ET&S)</p></details> |

In contrast to conventional spatially discrete antenna arrays, CAPAs can exploit the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by emitting information-bearing electromagnetic (EM) waves through continuous source current distributed across the aperture. Nevertheless, such an operation renders the beamforming optimization problem as a non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, which is challenging for conventional discrete optimization methods. A couple of low-complexity approaches are proposed to solve the functional programming problem. 1) Calculus of variations (CoV)-based approach: Closed-form structure of the optimal continuous source patterns are derived based on CoV, inspiring a low-complexity integral-free iterative algorithm for solving the functional programming problem. 2) Correlation-based zero-forcing (Corr-ZF) approach: Closed-form ZF source current patterns that completely eliminate the inter-user interference are derived based on the channel correlations. By using these patterns, the original functional programming problem is transformed to a simple power allocation problem, which can be solved using the classical water-filling approach with reduced complexity. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) compared to the state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization approach, the proposed CoV-based approach not only improves communication performance but also reduces computational complexity by up to hundreds of times for large CAPA apertures and high frequencies, and ii) the proposed Corr-ZF approach achieves asymptotically optimal performance compared to the CoV-based approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Previous methods manually parse tool documentation and create in-context demonstrations, transforming tools into structured formats for LLMs to use in their step-by-step reasoning. However, this manual process requires domain expertise and struggles to scale to large toolsets. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on ad-hoc inference techniques or special tokens to integrate free-form LLM generation with tool-calling actions, limiting the LLM's flexibility in handling diverse tool specifications and integrating multiple tools. In this work, we propose AutoTools, a framework that enables LLMs to automate the tool-use workflow. Specifically, the LLM automatically transforms tool documentation into callable functions, verifying syntax and runtime correctness. Then, the LLM integrates these functions into executable programs to solve practical tasks, flexibly grounding tool-use actions into its reasoning processes. Extensive experiments on existing and newly collected, more challenging benchmarks illustrate the superiority of our framework. Inspired by these promising results, we further investigate how to improve the expertise of LLMs, especially open-source LLMs with fewer parameters, within AutoTools. Thus, we propose the AutoTools-learning approach, training the LLMs with three learning tasks on 34k instances of high-quality synthetic data, including documentation understanding, relevance learning, and function programming. Fine-grained results validate the effectiveness of our overall training approach and each individual task. Our methods are an important step towards the use of LLMs for solving real-world tasks with external tools.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |

However, the promoting effect of combining the two mechanisms on efficient generation remains under-explored. Through empirical investigation, we find that the combination of quantization and cache mechanisms for DiT is not straightforward, and two key challenges lead to severe catastrophic performance degradation: (i) the sample efficacy of calibration datasets in post-training quantization (PTQ) is significantly eliminated by cache operation; (ii) the combination of the above mechanisms introduces more severe exposure bias within sampling distribution, resulting in amplified error accumulation in the image generation process. In this work, we take advantage of these two acceleration mechanisms and propose a hybrid acceleration method by tackling the above challenges, aiming to further improve the efficiency of DiTs while maintaining excellent generation capability. Concretely, a temporal-aware parallel clustering (TAP) is designed to dynamically improve the sample selection efficacy for the calibration within PTQ for different diffusion steps. A variance compensation (VC) strategy is derived to correct the sampling distribution. It mitigates exposure bias through an adaptive correction factor generation. Extensive experiments have shown that our method has accelerated DiTs by 12.7x while preserving competitive generation capability.

However, expert in exist MoE paradigm works as an individual, thereby lacking high-quality expert interactions. Moreover, they have not been effectively extended to attention block, which constrains further efficiency improvements. To tackle these issues, we propose Union-of-Experts (UoE), which decomposes transformer into an equitant group of experts, and then implement dynamic routing on input data and experts. Our approach advances MoE design with three key innovations: (1) We conducted equitant expert decomposition on both MLP blocks and attention blocks based on matrix partition in tensor parallelism. (2) We developed two routing paradigms: patch wise data selection and expert selection, to apply routing across different levels. (3) We design the architecture of UoE model, including Selective Multi-Head Attention (SMHA) and Union-of-MLP-Experts (UoME). (4) We develop parallel implementation of UoE's routing and computation operation, and optimize efficiency based on the hardware processing analysis. The experiments demonstrate that the model employed with UoE surpass Full Attention, state-of-art MoEs and efficient transformers in several tasks across image and natural language domains.

However, their lengthy denoising process and computationally intensive score estimation network impede their scalability in low-latency and resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses and accelerates diffusion models without retraining, but it inevitably introduces additional quantization noise, resulting in mean and variance deviations. In this work, we propose D2-DPM, a dual denoising mechanism aimed at precisely mitigating the adverse effects of quantization noise on the noise estimation network. Specifically, we first unravel the impact of quantization noise on the sampling equation into two components: the mean deviation and the variance deviation. The mean deviation alters the drift coefficient of the sampling equation, influencing the trajectory trend, while the variance deviation magnifies the diffusion coefficient, impacting the convergence of the sampling trajectory. The proposed D2-DPM is thus devised to denoise the quantization noise at each time step, and then denoise the noisy sample through the inverse diffusion iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that D2-DPM achieves superior generation quality, yielding a 1.42 lower FID than the full-precision model while achieving 3.99x compression and 11.67x bit-operation acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, acceptted by AAAI2025, the code is available at https://github.com/taylorjocelyn/d2-dpm</p></details> |

An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025</p></details> |

However, in outdoor conditions typical in agricultural remote sensing, cameras based on UC-FPAs may suffer from drift in offset and gain. To tackle the persistent drift, the system requires continuous calibration. Our goal in this study was to eliminate this requirement via a computational schema. In a former study, we estimated unknown gain and offset values and thermographic images of an object from a sequence of pairs of successive images taken at two different blur levels.In the current work, we took on a similar problem using a sequence of shifted images, with relative shifts caused by realistic drone hovering modeled by homography transformation. This places our work in the realm of scene-based nonuniformity correction problems. We show that an object's thermographic values, as well as gain and offset, can be jointly estimated by relying on a few sets of shifted images. We use a minimum likelihood estimator, which is found using alternating minimization. Registration is done using a generalized Lucas-Kanade method. Simulations show promising accuracy with mean Pearson correlation of more than 0.9999998 between ground truth and restoration. Under ideal assumptions, this is equivalent to a mean restoration error of less than 0.01 Celsius degree.</p></details> | <details><summary>Imagi...</summary><p>Imaging, Inverse problems, Functional analysis, Blind deconvolution</p></details> |

Under such scenarios, traditional frame-based cameras may fail to capture the structure and color information due to the exposure time limitation. Event cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that respond to pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously. Event cameras' high dynamic range is pivotal for visual perception in extreme low-light scenarios, surpassing traditional cameras and enabling applications in challenging dark environments. In this paper, inspired by the success of the retinex theory for traditional frame-based low-light image restoration, we introduce the first methods that combine the retinex theory with event cameras and propose a novel retinex-based low-light image restoration framework named ERetinex. Among our contributions, the first is developing a new approach that leverages the high temporal resolution data from event cameras with traditional image information to estimate scene illumination accurately. This method outperforms traditional image-only techniques, especially in low-light environments, by providing more precise lighting information. Additionally, we propose an effective fusion strategy that combines the high dynamic range data from event cameras with the color information of traditional images to enhance image quality. Through this fusion, we can generate clearer and more detail-rich images, maintaining the integrity of visual information even under extreme lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a gain of 1.0613 dB in PSNR while reducing FLOPS by \textbf{84.28}\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

They typically proceed by assuming a functional prior to the ODE solution, which is then queried on a grid to form a posterior distribution over the ODE solution. As the queries span the integration interval, the approximate posterior solution then converges to the true deterministic one. Gaussian ODE filters, in particular, have enjoyed a lot of attention due to their computational efficiency, the simplicity of their implementation, as well as their provable fast convergence rates. In this article, we extend the methodology to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and propose a probabilistic simulator for SDEs. Our approach involves transforming the SDE into a sequence of random ODEs using piecewise differentiable approximations of the Brownian motion. We then apply probabilistic ODE solvers to the individual ODEs, resulting in a pathwise probabilistic solution to the SDE\@. We establish worst-case strong $1.5$ local and $1.0$ global convergence orders for a specific instance of our method. We further show how we can marginalise the Brownian approximations, by incorporating its coefficients as part of the prior ODE model, allowing for computing exact transition densities under our model. Finally, we numerically validate the theoretical findings, showcasing reasonable weak convergence properties in the marginalised version.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, accepted to Bayesian Analysis, to be announced</p></details> |

However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

Recent work (Cai et al., 2024) showed that a broad class of learning dynamics, including Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update (OMWU), can exhibit arbitrarily slow last-iterate convergence even in simple $2 \times 2$ matrix games, despite many of these dynamics being known to converge asymptotically in the last iterate. It remains unclear, however, whether these algorithms achieve fast non-ergodic convergence under weaker criteria, such as best-iterate convergence. We show that for $2\times 2$ matrix games, OMWU achieves an $O(T^{-1/6})$ best-iterate convergence rate, in stark contrast to its slow last-iterate convergence in the same class of games. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound showing that OMWU does not achieve any polynomial random-iterate convergence rate, measured by the expected duality gaps across all iterates. This result challenges the conventional wisdom that random-iterate convergence is essentially equivalent to best-iterate convergence, with the former often used as a proxy for establishing the latter. Our analysis uncovers a new connection to dynamic regret and presents a novel two-phase approach to best-iterate convergence, which could be of independent interest.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to hierarchically represent building structures as a program, which can be efficiently converted into a mesh. We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArcPro outperforms both traditional architectural proxy reconstruction and learning-based abstraction methods. We further explore its potential to work with multi-view image and natural language inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Patent Protected); Project page: https://vcc.tech/research/2025/ArcPro</p></details> |

For a proper comparison of numeral systems across different languages, however, it is important to code them in a standardized form that allows for the comparison of basic properties. Here, we present a simple but effective coding scheme for numeral annotation, along with a workflow that helps to code numeral systems in a computer-assisted manner, providing sample data for numerals from 1 to 40 in 25 typologically diverse languages. We perform a thorough analysis of the sample, focusing on the systematic comparison between the underlying and the surface morphological structure. We further experiment with automated models for morpheme segmentation, where we find allomorphy as the major reason for segmentation errors. Finally, we show that subword tokenization algorithms are not viable for discovering morphemes in low-resource scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 7th Workshop on Research in Computational Linguistic Typology and Multilingual NLP (SIGTYP)</p></details> |

Query embedding approaches this problem by computing the low-dimensional vector representations of entities, relations, and logical queries. KGs exhibit relational patterns such as symmetry and composition and modeling the patterns can further enhance the performance of query embedding models. However, the role of such patterns in answering FOL queries by query embedding models has not been yet studied in the literature. In this paper, we fill in this research gap and empower FOL queries reasoning with pattern inference by introducing an inductive bias that allows for learning relation patterns. To this end, we develop a novel query embedding method, RoConE, that defines query regions as geometric cones and algebraic query operators by rotations in complex space. RoConE combines the advantages of Cone as a well-specified geometric representation for query embedding, and also the rotation operator as a powerful algebraic operation for pattern inference. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets confirm the advantage of relational patterns for enhancing logical query answering task.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The results reported in this paper are included in our accepted paper arXiv:2407.09212 at ECAI 2024</p></details> |

The algorithm works as follows: at inference time, N samples are drawn from the language model, and the sample with the highest reward, as judged by a reward model, is returned as the output. Despite its effectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput by a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is to fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To achieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then propose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to the BoN distribution. Our approach is analogous to mean-field variational inference and, thus, we term it variational BoN (vBoN). To the extent this fine-tuning is successful and we end up with a good approximation, we have reduced the inference cost by a factor of N. Our experiments on controlled generation and summarization tasks show that BoN is the most effective alignment method, and our variational approximation to BoN achieves the closest performance to BoN and surpasses models fine-tuned using the standard KL-constrained RL objective. In the controlled generation task, vBoN appears more frequently on the Pareto frontier of reward and KL divergence compared to other alignment methods. In the summarization task, vBoN achieves high reward values across various sampling temperatures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

The invariant features model is a new paradigm for multi-source data integration which posits that a small number of covariates affect the outcome identically across all possible environments.

In this work, we provide a general framework for estimation under the invariant features model that is computationally efficient and statistically flexible. We also provide a robust extension of our proposed method to protect against possibly corrupted or misspecified data sources. We demonstrate the robust properties of our method via simulations, and use it to build a transferable prediction model for end stage renal disease using electronic health records from the All of Us research program.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

Smaller language models (SLMs), typically with < 13B parameters, have been improved by using the data generated from very-large LMs through knowledge distillation. However, various practical constraints such as API costs, copyright, legal and ethical policies restrict using large (often opaque) models to train smaller models for commercial use. Limited success has been achieved at improving the ability of an SLM to explore the space of possible rationales and evaluate them by itself through self-deliberation. To address this, we propose COALITION, a trainable framework that facilitates interaction between two variants of the same SLM and trains them to generate and refine rationales optimized for the end-task. The variants exhibit different behaviors to produce a set of diverse candidate rationales during the generation and refinement steps. The model is then trained via Selective Rationale Optimization (SRO) to prefer generating rationale candidates that maximize the likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. During inference, COALITION employs a controller to select the suitable variant for generating and refining the rationales. On five different datasets covering mathematical problems, commonsense reasoning, and natural language inference, COALITION outperforms several baselines by up to 5%. Our ablation studies reveal that cross-communication between the two variants performs better than using the single model to self-refine the rationales. We also demonstrate the applicability of COALITION for LMs of varying scales (4B to 14B parameters) and model families (Mistral, Llama, Qwen, Phi).

Over the past few years, the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has made significant progress in rendering quality but behaves poorly in run-time performance due to the low efficiency of volumetric rendering.

| **[Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symmetry rules that atoms obey when they bond together to form an ordered crystal play a fundamental role in determining their physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. Consistently generating stable crystal structures is still an open challenge, specifically because such symmetry rules are not accounted for. To address this issue, we propose WyFormer, a generative model for materials conditioned on space group symmetry. We use Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer and an absence of positional encoding. WyFormer has a unique and powerful synergy of attributes, proven by extensive experimentation: best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, physics-motivated inductive bias, competitive stability of the generated structures, competitive material property prediction quality, and unparalleled inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SymmetryAdvantage/WyckoffTransformer</p></details> |
| **[Unified Video Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00200v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A unified video and action model holds significant promise for robotics, where videos provide rich scene information for action prediction, and actions provide dynamics information for video prediction. However, effectively combining video generation and action prediction remains challenging, and current video generation-based methods struggle to match the performance of direct policy learning in action accuracy and inference speed. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes video and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action inference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation and decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges the visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between video and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two lightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing video generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables versatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking actions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy learning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation. Via an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a general-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy learning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without compromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific applications.

Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92\% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, In submission to IROS2025</p></details> |

The Collaboration-of-Experts (CoE) approach integrates multiple expert models, improving the accuracy of generated results and offering great potential for precision-critical applications, such as automatic circuit board quality inspection. However, deploying CoE serving systems presents challenges to memory capacity due to the large number of experts required, which can lead to significant performance overhead from frequent expert switching across different memory and storage tiers. We propose CoServe, an efficient CoE model serving system on heterogeneous CPU and GPU with limited memory. CoServe reduces unnecessary expert switching by leveraging expert dependency, a key property of CoE inference. CoServe introduces a dependency-aware request scheduler and dependency-aware expert management for efficient inference. It also introduces an offline profiler to automatically find optimal resource allocation on various processors and devices. In real-world intelligent manufacturing workloads, CoServe achieves 4.5$\times$ to 12$\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASPLOS '25</p></details> |

We introduce Audio-Reasoner, a large-scale audio language model for deep reasoning in audio tasks. We meticulously curated a large-scale and diverse multi-task audio dataset with simple annotations. Then, we leverage closed-source models to conduct secondary labeling, QA generation, along with structured COT process. These datasets together form a high-quality reasoning dataset with 1.2 million reasoning-rich samples, which we name CoTA. Following inference scaling principles, we train Audio-Reasoner on CoTA, enabling it to achieve great logical capabilities in audio reasoning.

A "visual analogy" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the "what" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the "how" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-o1, performs better in tasks involving simple surface-level visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of extrinsic spatial properties in the physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

| **[Accelerating Auto-regressive Text-to-Image Generation with Training-free Speculative Jacobi Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01699v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current large auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, high-resolution images, but these models require hundreds or even thousands of steps of next-token prediction during inference, resulting in substantial time consumption. In existing studies, Jacobi decoding, an iterative parallel decoding algorithm, has been used to accelerate the auto-regressive generation and can be executed without training. However, the Jacobi decoding relies on a deterministic criterion to determine the convergence of iterations. Thus, it works for greedy decoding but is incompatible with sampling-based decoding which is crucial for visual quality and diversity in the current auto-regressive text-to-image generation. In this paper, we propose a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm, Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD), to accelerate auto-regressive text-to-image generation. By introducing a probabilistic convergence criterion, our SJD accelerates the inference of auto-regressive text-to-image generation while maintaining the randomness in sampling-based token decoding and allowing the model to generate diverse images. Specifically, SJD facilitates the model to predict multiple tokens at each step and accepts tokens based on the probabilistic criterion, enabling the model to generate images with fewer steps than the conventional next-token-prediction paradigm. We also investigate the token initialization strategies that leverage the spatial locality of visual data to further improve the acceleration ratio under specific scenarios. We conduct experiments for our proposed SJD on multiple auto-regressive text-to-image generation models, showing the effectiveness of model acceleration without sacrificing the visual quality.

This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</p></details> |

To address this, we present TweedieMix, a novel method for composing customized diffusion models during the inference phase. By analyzing the properties of reverse diffusion sampling, our approach divides the sampling process into two stages. During the initial steps, we apply a multiple object-aware sampling technique to ensure the inclusion of the desired target objects. In the later steps, we blend the appearances of the custom concepts in the de-noised image space using Tweedie's formula. Our results demonstrate that TweedieMix can generate multiple personalized concepts with higher fidelity than existing methods. Moreover, our framework can be effortlessly extended to image-to-video diffusion models, enabling the generation of videos that feature multiple personalized concepts.

| **[Continual Multi-Robot Learning from Black-Box Visual Place Recognition Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02256v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of visual place recognition (VPR), continual learning (CL) techniques offer significant potential for avoiding catastrophic forgetting when learning new places. However, existing CL methods often focus on knowledge transfer from a known model to a new one, overlooking the existence of unknown black-box models. We explore a novel multi-robot CL approach that enables knowledge transfer from black-box VPR models (teachers), such as those of local robots encountered by traveler robots (students) in unknown environments. Specifically, we introduce Membership Inference Attack, or MIA, the only major privacy attack applicable to black-box models, and leverage it to reconstruct pseudo training sets, which serve as the key knowledge to be exchanged between robots, from black-box VPR models. Furthermore, we aim to overcome the inherently low sampling efficiency of MIA by leveraging insights on place class prediction distribution and un-learned class detection imported from the VPR literature as a prior distribution. We also analyze both the individual effects of these methods and their combined impact. Experimental results demonstrate that our black-box MIA (BB-MIA) approach is remarkably powerful despite its simplicity, significantly enhancing the VPR capability of lower-performing robots through brief communication with other robots. This study contributes to optimizing knowledge sharing between robots in VPR and enhancing autonomy in open-world environments with multi-robot systems that are fault-tolerant and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |

One of the main challenges for the 50G PON is implementing burst-mode digital signal processing (BM-DSP) for the burst upstream signal. In this paper, we demonstrate a real-time BM-DSP for burst reception of 25Gbit/s on-off keying signal to meet the asymmetric-mode 50G PON demand. The real-time BM-DSP includes the BM frequency-domain timing recovery and BM frequency-domain equalizer, which can be fast converged based on the 42ns designed preamble. Meanwhile, the simplified implementations for fast-Fourier-transform, minimum-mean-square-error, and decision-directed least-mean-square-error algorithms decrease the DSP resources by 28.57%, enabling the loading of real-time BM-DSP in the field programmable gate array with the limited DSP resources. The real-time implementation of BM-DSP can guide the design of application-specific integrated circuits for 50G PON.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Journal of Optical Communications and Networking</p></details> |

Existing approaches have only limited successes in LLM personalization, due to the absence of personalized learning or the reliance on shared personal data. This paper proposes a new approach for a few-shot personalization of LLMs with their mis-aligned responses (Fermi). Our key idea is to learn a set of personalized prompts for each user by progressively improving the prompts using LLMs, based on user profile (e.g., demographic information) and a few examples of previous opinions. During an iterative process of prompt improvement, we incorporate the contexts of mis-aligned responses by LLMs, which are especially crucial for the effective personalization of LLMs. In addition, we develop an effective inference method to further leverage the context of the test query and the personalized prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that Fermi significantly improves performance across various benchmarks, compared to best-performing baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 25 (main, long), 32 pages</p></details> |

Our proposed fusion methods focus on the memory cell state and the hidden state in the seq2seq decoder long short-term memory (LSTM), and the memory cell state is updated by the LM unlike the prior studies. This means the memory retained by the main seq2seq would be adjusted by the external LM. These fusion methods have several variants depending on the architecture of this memory cell update and the use of memory cell and hidden states which directly affects the final label inference. We performed the experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in a mono-lingual ASR setup on the Librispeech corpus and in a transfer learning setup from a multilingual ASR (MLASR) base model to a low-resourced language. In Librispeech, our best model improved WER by 3.7%, 2.4% for test clean, test other relatively to the shallow fusion baseline, with multi-level decoding. In transfer learning from an MLASR base model to the IARPA Babel Swahili model, the best scheme improved the transferred model on eval set by 9.9%, 9.8% in CER, WER relatively to the 2-stage transfer baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables, ICASSP 2019, A notice added to the previous version</p></details> |

In practical scenarios, tuning the step-size and momentum parameters of the method is a prohibitively expensive and time-consuming process. In this work, inspired by the recent advantages of stochastic Polyak step-size in the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we propose and explore new Polyak-type variants suitable for the update rule of the SHB method. In particular, using the Iterate Moving Average (IMA) viewpoint of SHB, we propose and analyze three novel step-size selections: MomSPS$_{\max}$, MomDecSPS, and MomAdaSPS. For MomSPS$_{\max}$, we provide convergence guarantees for SHB to a neighborhood of the solution for convex and smooth problems (without assuming interpolation). If interpolation is also satisfied, then using MomSPS$_{\max}$, SHB converges to the true solution at a fast rate matching the deterministic HB. The other two variants, MomDecSPS and MomAdaSPS, are the first adaptive step-size for SHB that guarantee convergence to the exact minimizer - without a priori knowledge of the problem parameters and without assuming interpolation. Our convergence analysis of SHB is tight and obtains the convergence guarantees of stochastic Polyak step-size for SGD as a special case. We supplement our analysis with experiments validating our theory and demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>13th ...</summary><p>13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Since the quantile loss function is neither smooth nor strongly convex, we view such SGD iterates as an irreducible and positive recurrent Markov chain. By leveraging this interpretation, we show the existence of a unique asymptotic stationary distribution, regardless of the arbitrarily fixed initialization. To characterize the exact form of this limiting distribution, we derive bounds for its moment generating function and tail probabilities, controlling over the first and second moments of SGD iterates. By these techniques, we prove that the stationary distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution as the constant learning rate $\eta\rightarrow0$. Our findings provide the first central limit theorem (CLT)-type theoretical guarantees for the last iterate of constant learning-rate SGD in non-smooth and non-strongly convex settings. We further propose a recursive algorithm to construct confidence intervals of SGD iterates in an online manner. Numerical studies demonstrate strong finite-sample performance of our proposed quantile estimator and inference method. The theoretical tools in this study are of independent interest to investigate general transition kernels in Markov chains.</p></details> | 27 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Can LLMs Lie? Investigation beyond Hallucination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03518v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics, shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in high-stakes environments.

| **[LumiNet: Latent Intrinsics Meets Diffusion Models for Indoor Scene Relighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00177v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LumiNet, a novel architecture that leverages generative models and latent intrinsic representations for effective lighting transfer. Given a source image and a target lighting image, LumiNet synthesizes a relit version of the source scene that captures the target's lighting. Our approach makes two key contributions: a data curation strategy from the StyleGAN-based relighting model for our training, and a modified diffusion-based ControlNet that processes both latent intrinsic properties from the source image and latent extrinsic properties from the target image. We further improve lighting transfer through a learned adaptor (MLP) that injects the target's latent extrinsic properties via cross-attention and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional ControlNet, which generates images with conditional maps from a single scene, LumiNet processes latent representations from two different images - preserving geometry and albedo from the source while transferring lighting characteristics from the target. Experiments demonstrate that our method successfully transfers complex lighting phenomena including specular highlights and indirect illumination across scenes with varying spatial layouts and materials, outperforming existing approaches on challenging indoor scenes using only images as input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrects an evaluation bug in Table 1 due to a data normalization error.

| **[Easier Painting Than Thinking: Can Text-to-Image Models Set the Stage, but Not Direct the Play?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03516v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile, these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive, inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.

| **[Bayesian Multivariate Sparse Functional PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03512v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA) provides a parsimonious, semi-parametric model for multivariate, sparsely-observed functional data. Frequentist FPCA approaches estimate principal components (PCs) from the data, then condition on these estimates in subsequent analyses. As an alternative, we propose a fully Bayesian inferential framework for multivariate, sparse functional data (MSFAST) which explicitly models the PCs and incorporates their uncertainty. MSFAST builds upon the FAST approach to FPCA for univariate, densely-observed functional data. Like FAST, MSFAST represents PCs using orthonormal splines, samples the orthonormal spline coefficients using parameter expansion, and enforces eigenvalue ordering during model fit. MSFAST extends FAST to multivariate, sparsely-observed data by (1) standardizing each functional covariate to mitigate poor posterior conditioning due to disparate scales; (2) using a better-suited orthogonal spline basis; (3) parallelizing likelihood calculations over covariates; (4) updating parameterizations and priors for computational stability; (5) using a Procrustes-based posterior alignment procedure; and (6) providing efficient prediction routines. We evaluated MSFAST alongside existing implementations using simulations. MSFAST produces uniquely valid inferences and accurate estimates, particularly for smaller signals. MSFAST is motivated by and applied to a study of child growth, with an accompanying vignette illustrating the implementation step-by-step.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures for main text.

| **[Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with uncertainty quantification and model comparison using Bayesian normalizing flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05657v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations can be costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate population synthesis runs to enable simulation-based inference from observed catalogs and data augmentation for feature prediction in rarely synthesizable sub-populations. However, flow predictions can be wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work, we develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by implementing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function naturally associated with density estimators, we sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. We demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, inference, and data-augmentation impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. We outline the applications of the proposed methodology in the context of simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and feature prediction, with state-of-the-art binary evolution simulators, now marginalized over model and data uncertainties.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |
| **[MPCritic: A plug-and-play MPC architecture for reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01086v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) communities have developed vast ecosystems of theoretical approaches and computational tools for solving optimal control problems. Given their conceptual similarities but differing strengths, there has been increasing interest in synergizing RL and MPC. However, existing approaches tend to be limited for various reasons, including computational cost of MPC in an RL algorithm and software hurdles towards seamless integration of MPC and RL tools. These challenges often result in the use of "simple" MPC schemes or RL algorithms, neglecting the state-of-the-art in both areas. This paper presents MPCritic, a machine learning-friendly architecture that interfaces seamlessly with MPC tools. MPCritic utilizes the loss landscape defined by a parameterized MPC problem, focusing on "soft" optimization over batched training steps; thereby updating the MPC parameters while avoiding costly minimization and parametric sensitivities. Since the MPC structure is preserved during training, an MPC agent can be readily used for online deployment, where robust constraint satisfaction is paramount. We demonstrate the versatility of MPCritic, in terms of MPC architectures and RL algorithms that it can accommodate, on classic control benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CDC 2...</summary><p>CDC 2025 final version</p></details> |
| **[The Nah Bandit: Modeling User Non-compliance in Recommendation Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07897v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommendation systems now pervade the digital world, ranging from advertising to entertainment. However, it remains challenging to implement effective recommendation systems in the physical world, such as in mobility or health. This work focuses on a key challenge: in the physical world, it is often easy for the user to opt out of taking any recommendation if they are not to her liking, and to fall back to her baseline behavior. It is thus crucial in cyber-physical recommendation systems to operate with an interaction model that is aware of such user behavior, lest the user abandon the recommendations altogether. This paper thus introduces the Nah Bandit, a tongue-in-cheek reference to describe a Bandit problem where users can say `nah' to the recommendation and opt for their preferred option instead. As such, this problem lies in between a typical bandit setup and supervised learning. We model the user non-compliance by parameterizing an anchoring effect of recommendations on users. We then propose the Expert with Clustering (EWC) algorithm, a hierarchical approach that incorporates feedback from both recommended and non-recommended options to accelerate user preference learning. In a recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ clusters, EWC achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$, achieving superior theoretical performance in the short term compared to LinUCB algorithm. Experimental results also highlight that EWC outperforms both supervised learning and traditional contextual bandit approaches. This advancement reveals that effective use of non-compliance feedback can accelerate preference learning and improve recommendation accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future research in Nah Bandit, providing a robust framework for more effective recommendation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems</p></details> |
| **[LimiX: Unleashing Structured-Data Modeling Capability for Generalist Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03505v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 56 pages |
| **[Strefer: Empowering Video LLMs with Space-Time Referring and Reasoning via Synthetic Instruction Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03501v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments. Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally, these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This technical report serves as the archival version of our paper accepted at the ICCV 2025 Workshop.

| **[Real-Time Instrument Planning and Perception for Novel Measurements of Dynamic Phenomena](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03500v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in onboard computing mean remote sensing agents can employ state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning at the edge. These capabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint measurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an automated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in look-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a follow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of magnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument compared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of 18th Symposium on Advanced Space Technologies in Robotics and Automation</p></details> |

In this study, a novel benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers. The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, dataset available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBARI-org/DeepSea-MOT</p></details> |
| **[OneCAT: Decoder-Only Auto-Regressive Model for Unified Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03498v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Online Resource Allocation with Cancellations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11570v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We initiate the study of two-sided online resource allocation with costly cancellations. Our focus is on edge-weighted online bipartite matching (and several of its extensions), where nodes arrive online and request offline resources. In contrast to the classic literature, any fraction of an offline resource that was preallocated to an earlier online node can be reclaimed, resulting in the loss of the previously allocated edge-weight plus an additional penalty equal to a non-negative constant factor $f$ times the edge-weight. Parameterizing the problem by the buyback factor $f$, our main result is the development of optimal competitive algorithms for \emph{all possible values} of $f$ through a novel primal-dual family of algorithms in the fractional (or equivalently, large capacity) setting, and establishing their optimality by deriving matching lower bounds. Interestingly, our results reveal a phase transition: for the small buyback regime ($f < \frac{e-2}{2}$), the optimal competitive ratio is $\frac{e}{e-(1+f)}$, and for the large buyback regime ($f \geq \frac{e-2}{2}$), the competitive ratio is $-W_{-1}\left(\frac{-1}{e(1+f)}\right)$, where $W_{-1}$ is the non-principal branch of the Lambert $W$ function. We also study variants of this model, such as matching with deterministic integral allocations. We again show a phase transition: for the small buyback regime ($f < \frac{1}{3}$), the optimal competitive ratio is $\frac{2}{1-f}$, while for the large buyback regime ($f \geq \frac{1}{3}$), the competitive ratio is $1 + 2f + 2\sqrt{f(1+f)}$. We further consider various extensions, including to configuration allocations and submodular welfare maximization, as well as negative values of $f$, modeling a secondary supply channels or overflow capacities available at discounted rates. Our unifying primal-dual framework achieves the exact optimal competitive ratio across all these variants</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary conference version of this work has appeared in the ACM Economics and Computations(EC) 2023 conference under the title "Online Resource Allocation with Buyback: Optimal Algorithms via Primal-Dual." ; An earlier version of this paper was distributed under the title "Online Matching with Cancellation Costs."</p></details> |
| **[Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03495v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, accepted for the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids 2025</p></details> |

Rip currents are dangerous, fast-moving flows that pose a major risk to beach safety worldwide, making accurate visual detection an important and underexplored research task. The challenge builds on RipVIS, the largest available rip current dataset, and focuses on single-class instance segmentation, where precise delineation is critical to fully capture the extent of rip currents. The dataset spans diverse locations, rip current types, and camera orientations, providing a realistic and challenging benchmark. In total, $75$ participants registered for this first edition, resulting in $5$ valid test submissions. Teams were evaluated on a composite score combining $F_1$, $F_2$, $AP_{50}$, and $AP_{[50:95]}$, ensuring robust and application-relevant rankings. The top-performing methods leveraged deep learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse conditions. This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip current segmentation. We conclude with a discussion of key challenges, lessons learned from the submissions, and future directions for expanding RipSeg.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chall...</summary><p>Challenge report paper from AIM2025 Workshop at ICCVW 2025</p></details> |
| **[Globally Asymptotically Stable Trajectory Tracking of Underactuated UAVs using Geometric Algebra](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03484v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper employs Geometric Algebra (GA) tools to model the dynamics of objects in 3-dimensional space, serving as a proof of concept to facilitate control design for trajectory tracking in underactuated systems. For control purposes, the model is structured as a cascade system, where a rotational subsystem drives a translational one. The rotational subsystem is linear, while the translational subsystem follows a linear-plus-perturbation form, thereby reducing the complexity of control design. A control strategy requiring only simple operations, no memory, and no iterative search loops is presented to illustrate the main features of the GA model. By employing GA to model both translations and rotations, a singularity-free and geometrically intuitive representation can be achieved through the use of the geometric product. Closed-loop stability is rigorously established using input-to-state stability methods. Numerical simulations of a quad tilt-rotorcraft performing trajectory tracking in a windy environment validate the controller's stability and performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TAES for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Efficiently Editing Mixture-of-Experts Models with Compressed Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00634v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a key approach for scaling large language models efficiently by activating only a subset of experts during training and inference. Typically, the number of activated experts presents a trade-off: fewer experts reduce computational costs, while more experts improve performance. Recent studies reveal that not all activated experts contribute equally to model performance, with some providing minimal utility, particularly when finetuning pretrained MoE models for specialized downstream tasks. The co-existence of significant and redundant parameters in experts provides us an opportunity to reduce the number of activated experts while maintaining model performance. In this work, we propose the concept of compressed experts, lightweight modules that serve as compact representations of full experts. Our approach preserves the most important experts while replacing other auxiliary activated experts with compressed experts. The reduction of active parameters significantly lowers inference costs while achieving comparable performance. Extensive experiments on models including Phi-MoE and OLMoE demonstrate that compressed experts recover over 90% of full expert performance across various tasks while reducing more than 30% active parameters and saving 20% in inference costs. This approach enables efficient deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained settings and facilitates scaling to larger models with manageable overhead.

However, evaluation benchmarks for LLM agents rarely feature natural questions that are both information-seeking and genuinely time-consuming for humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural and time-consuming questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and manually answer real-world time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and hallucinations. Our results underscore the limitations of LLM-powered agents in handling the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world information-seeking tasks -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource for tracking such progress.

At the same time, soft robotic research has made considerable strides toward general modeling and control, despite soft robots and deformable objects being very similar from a mechanical standpoint. In this work, we leverage these recent results to develop a control-oriented, fully dynamic framework of slender deformable objects grasped at one end by a robotic manipulator. We introduce a dynamic model of this system using functional strain parameterizations and describe the manipulation challenge as a regulation control problem. This enables us to define a fully model-based control architecture, for which we can prove analytically closed-loop stability and provide sufficient conditions for steady state convergence to the desired state. The nature of this work is intended to be markedly experimental. We provide an extensive experimental validation of the proposed ideas, tasking a robot arm with controlling the distal end of six different cables, in a given planar position and orientation in space.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 18 figures.

| **[Insertion Language Models: Sequence Generation with Arbitrary-Position Insertions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05755v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive models (ARMs), which predict subsequent tokens one-by-one ``from left to right,'' have achieved significant success across a wide range of sequence generation tasks. However, they struggle to accurately represent sequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential dependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking multiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs cannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be filled in is not known in advance. In this work, we introduce Insertion Language Models (ILMs), which learn to insert tokens at arbitrary positions in a sequence -- that is, they select jointly both the position and the vocabulary element to be inserted. By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent strong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in arbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token dependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs, we propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising objective. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that ILMs outperform both ARMs and MDMs on common planning tasks. Furthermore, we show that ILMs outperform MDMs and perform on par with ARMs in an unconditional text generation task while offering greater flexibility than MDMs in arbitrary-length text infilling.

| **[Temporal Exposure Dependence Bias in Vaccine Efficacy Trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03476v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using time-to-event methods such as Cox proportional hazards models, it is well established that unmeasured heterogeneity in exposure or infection risk can lead to downward bias in point estimates of the per-contact vaccine efficacy (VE) in infectious disease trials. In this study, we explore an unreported source of bias-arising from temporally correlated exposure status-that is typically unmeasured and overlooked in standard analyses. Although this form of bias can plausibly affect a wide range of VE trials, it has received limited empirical attention. We develop a mathematical framework to characterize the mechanism of this bias and derive a closed-form approximation to quantify its magnitude without requiring direct measurement of exposure. Our findings show that, under realistic parameter settings, the resulting bias can be substantial. These results suggest that temporally correlated exposure should be recognized as a potentially important factor in the design and analysis of infectious disease vaccine trials.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

| **[OneCAT: Decoder-Only Auto-Regressive Model for Unified Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03498v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Efficiently Editing Mixture-of-Experts Models with Compressed Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00634v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a key approach for scaling large language models efficiently by activating only a subset of experts during training and inference. Typically, the number of activated experts presents a trade-off: fewer experts reduce computational costs, while more experts improve performance. Recent studies reveal that not all activated experts contribute equally to model performance, with some providing minimal utility, particularly when finetuning pretrained MoE models for specialized downstream tasks. The co-existence of significant and redundant parameters in experts provides us an opportunity to reduce the number of activated experts while maintaining model performance. In this work, we propose the concept of compressed experts, lightweight modules that serve as compact representations of full experts. Our approach preserves the most important experts while replacing other auxiliary activated experts with compressed experts. The reduction of active parameters significantly lowers inference costs while achieving comparable performance. Extensive experiments on models including Phi-MoE and OLMoE demonstrate that compressed experts recover over 90% of full expert performance across various tasks while reducing more than 30% active parameters and saving 20% in inference costs. This approach enables efficient deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained settings and facilitates scaling to larger models with manageable overhead.

L-GATr represents data in a geometric algebra over space-time and is equivariant under Lorentz transformations. The underlying architecture is a versatile and scalable transformer, which is able to break symmetries if needed. We demonstrate the power of L-GATr for amplitude regression and jet classification, and then benchmark it as the first Lorentz-equivariant generative network. For all three LHC tasks, we find significant improvements over previous architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables. v2: added table 5, improved tagging results. v3: added table 7, incorporate feedback</p></details> |
| **[Continuous Saudi Sign Language Recognition: A Vision Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03467v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language (SL) is an essential communication form for hearing-impaired and deaf people, enabling engagement within the broader society. Despite its significance, limited public awareness of SL often leads to inequitable access to educational and professional opportunities, thereby contributing to social exclusion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where over 84,000 individuals depend on Saudi Sign Language (SSL) as their primary form of communication. Although certain technological approaches have helped to improve communication for individuals with hearing impairments, there continues to be an urgent requirement for more precise and dependable translation techniques, especially for Arabic sign language variants like SSL. Most state-of-the-art solutions have primarily focused on non-Arabic sign languages, resulting in a considerable absence of resources dedicated to Arabic sign language, specifically SSL. The complexity of the Arabic language and the prevalence of isolated sign language datasets that concentrate on individual words instead of continuous speech contribute to this issue. To address this gap, our research represents an important step in developing SSL resources. To address this, we introduce the first continuous Saudi Sign Language dataset called KAU-CSSL, focusing on complete sentences to facilitate further research and enable sophisticated recognition systems for SSL recognition and translation. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based model, utilizing a pretrained ResNet-18 for spatial feature extraction and a Transformer Encoder with Bidirectional LSTM for temporal dependencies, achieving 99.02\% accuracy at signer dependent mode and 77.71\% accuracy at signer independent mode. This development leads the way to not only improving communication tools for the SSL community but also making a substantial contribution to the wider field of sign language.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning Mechanism Underlying NLP Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03407v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks. The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT) increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently, higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token. These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 18 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-Based Power Optimization for Max-Min Fairness in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03561v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Power allocation is an important task in wireless communication networks. Classical optimization algorithms and deep learning methods, while effective in small and static scenarios, become either computationally demanding or unsuitable for large and dynamic networks with varying user loads. This letter explores the potential of transformer-based deep learning models to address these challenges. We propose a transformer neural network to jointly predict optimal uplink and downlink power using only user and access point positions. The max-min fairness problem in cell-free massive multiple input multiple output systems is considered. Numerical results show that the trained model provides near-optimal performance and adapts to varying numbers of users and access points without retraining, additional processing, or updating its neural network architecture. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving robust and flexible power allocation for dynamic networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal: IEEE Wireless Communications Letters Publication Date: AUGUST 2025</p></details> |
| **[In-place Double Stimulus Methodology for Subjective Assessment of High Quality Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09777v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel double stimulus subjective assessment methodology for the evaluation of high quality images to address the limitations of existing protocols in detecting subtle perceptual differences. The In-place Double Stimulus Quality Scale (IDSQS) allows subjects to alternately view a reference and a distorted image at the same spatial location, facilitating a more intuitive detection of differences in quality, especially at high to visually lossless quality levels. A large-scale crowdsourcing study employing this methodology was conducted, generating a comprehensive public dataset to evaluate perceived image quality across several compression algorithms and distortion levels. An additional contribution is the modeling of quality scores using a Beta distribution, allowing for the assessment of variability and subject consistency. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the IDSQS methodology in achieving high correlation with more precise subjective evaluation benchmarks. The dataset, subjective data, and graphical user interface developed for this study are publicly available at https://github.com/shimamohammadi/IDSQS</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted at European Workshop on Visual Information Processing</p></details> |
| **[The distribution of calibrated likelihood functions on the probability-likelihood Aitchison simplex](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03365v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses. Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability and the reliability of the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Improving Perceptual Audio Aesthetic Assessment via Triplet Loss and Self-Supervised Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03292v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a system for automatic multi-axis perceptual quality prediction of generative audio, developed for Track 2 of the AudioMOS Challenge 2025. The task is to predict four Audio Aesthetic Scores--Production Quality, Production Complexity, Content Enjoyment, and Content Usefulness--for audio generated by text-to-speech (TTS), text-to-audio (TTA), and text-to-music (TTM) systems. A main challenge is the domain shift between natural training data and synthetic evaluation data. To address this, we combine BEATs, a pretrained transformer-based audio representation model, with a multi-branch long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor and use a triplet loss with buffer-based sampling to structure the embedding space by perceptual similarity. Our results show that this improves embedding discriminability and generalization, enabling domain-robust audio quality assessment without synthetic training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop(ASRU), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accountability Framework for Healthcare AI Systems: Towards Joint Accountability in Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03286v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime. Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate the collaborative process.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in AAAI AIES 2025</p></details> |
| **[HydroVision: Predicting Optically Active Parameters in Surface Water Using Computer Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01882v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water. HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors, industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its operational utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under peer review for IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Population-Scale Network Embeddings Expose Educational Divides in Network Structure Related to Right-Wing Populist Voting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21236v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations -- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood, work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. After transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network differences in education to right-wing populist voting.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 6 figures, Supplementary Materials available at https://github.com/odissei-explainable-network/netaudit; small textual changes, update Figure 6</p></details> |
| **[SynBT: High-quality Tumor Synthesis for Breast Tumor Segmentation by 3D Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03267v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025 Deep-Breath Workshop.

In our work, we propose a novel solution - the Progressive Prompt Decision Transformer (P2DT). This method enhances a transformer-based model by dynamically appending decision tokens during new task training, thus fostering task-specific policies. Our approach mitigates forgetting in continual and offline reinforcement learning scenarios. Moreover, P2DT leverages trajectories collected via traditional reinforcement learning from all tasks and generates new task-specific tokens during training, thereby retaining knowledge from previous studies. Preliminary results demonstrate that our model effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and scales well with increasing task environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 49th IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[ORMind: A Cognitive-Inspired End-to-End Reasoning Framework for Operations Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01326v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing, logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition, implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Annual Meetings of the Association for Computational Linguistics 2025</p></details> |
| **[NeurStore: Efficient In-database Deep Learning Model Management System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03228v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication. Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figures, Accepted at SIGMOD 2026</p></details> |
| **[HodgeFormer: Transformers for Learnable Operators on Triangular Meshes through Data-Driven Hodge Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01839v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Words: Interjection Classification for Improved Human-Computer Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03181v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of human-computer interaction, fostering a natural dialogue between humans and machines is paramount. A key, often overlooked, component of this dialogue is the use of interjections such as "mmm" and "hmm". Despite their frequent use to express agreement, hesitation, or requests for information, these interjections are typically dismissed as "non-words" by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) engines. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel task dedicated to interjection classification, a pioneer in the field to our knowledge. This task is challenging due to the short duration of interjection signals and significant inter- and intra-speaker variability. In this work, we present and publish a dataset of interjection signals collected specifically for interjection classification. We employ this dataset to train and evaluate a baseline deep learning model. To enhance performance, we augment the training dataset using techniques such as tempo and pitch transformation, which significantly improve classification accuracy, making models more robust. The interjection dataset, a Python library for the augmentation pipeline, baseline model, and evaluation scripts, are available to the research community.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Quantum singular value transformation without block encodings: Near-optimal complexity with minimal ancilla](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02385v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop new algorithms for Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT), a unifying framework that encapsulates most known quantum algorithms and serves as the foundation for new ones. Existing implementations of QSVT rely on block encoding, incurring an intrinsic $O(\log L)$ ancilla overhead and circuit depth $\widetilde{O}(L d\lambda )$ for polynomial transformations of a Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{k=1}^L H_k$, where $d$ is the polynomial degree and $\lambda=\sum_{k}\|H_k\|$. We introduce a simple yet powerful approach that utilizes only basic Hamiltonian simulation techniques, namely, Trotter methods, to: (i) eliminate the need for block encoding, (ii) reduce the ancilla overhead to only a single qubit, and (iii) still maintain near-optimal complexity. Our method achieves a circuit depth of $\widetilde{O}(L(d\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}})^{1+o(1)})$, without requiring any complicated multi-qubit controlled gates. Moreover, $\lambda_{\mathrm{comm}}$ depends on the nested commutators of the terms of $H$ and can be substantially smaller than $\lambda$ for many physically relevant Hamiltonians, a feature absent in standard QSVT. To achieve these results, we make use of Richardson extrapolation in a novel way, systematically eliminating errors in any interleaved sequence of arbitrary unitaries and Hamiltonian evolution operators, thereby establishing a general framework that encompasses QSVT but is more broadly applicable. As applications, we develop end-to-end quantum algorithms for solving linear systems and estimating ground state properties of Hamiltonians, both achieving near-optimal complexity without relying on oracular access. Overall, our results establish a new framework for quantum algorithms, significantly reducing hardware overhead while maintaining near-optimal performance, with implications for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been split into two parts.

| **[Beyond Feature Mapping GAP: Integrating Real HDRTV Priors for Superior SDRTV-to-HDRTV Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10775v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of HDR-WCG display devices has highlighted the need to convert SDRTV to HDRTV, as most video sources are still in SDR. Existing methods primarily focus on designing neural networks to learn a single-style mapping from SDRTV to HDRTV. However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles in real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby constraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by generative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion guided by real HDRTV priors. Despite the limited information in SDRTV, introducing real HDRTV as reference priors significantly constrains the solution space of the originally high-dimensional ill-posed problem. This shift transforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a referenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the first stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to capture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input SDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs. We evaluate our method on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with significant improvements in both objective and subjective metrics across real and synthetic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[FastCaps: A Design Methodology for Accelerating Capsule Network on Field Programmable Gate Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03103v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown significant improvement in understanding the variation in images along with better generalization ability compared to traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CapsNet preserves spatial relationship among extracted features and apply dynamic routing to efficiently learn the internal connections between capsules. However, due to the capsule structure and the complexity of the routing mechanism, it is non-trivial to accelerate CapsNet performance in its original form on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Most of the existing works on CapsNet have achieved limited acceleration as they implement only the dynamic routing algorithm on FPGA, while considering all the processing steps synergistically is important for real-world applications of Capsule Networks. Towards this, we propose a novel two-step approach that deploys a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. First, we prune the network using a novel Look-Ahead Kernel Pruning (LAKP) methodology that uses the sum of look-ahead scores of the model parameters. Next, we simplify the nonlinear operations, reorder loops, and parallelize operations of the routing algorithm to reduce CapsNet hardware complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work accelerating a full-fledged CapsNet on FPGA. Experimental results on the MNIST and F-MNIST datasets (typical in Capsule Network community) show that the proposed LAKP approach achieves an effective compression rate of 99.26% and 98.84%, and achieves a throughput of 82 FPS and 48 FPS on Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA, respectively. Furthermore, reducing the hardware complexity of the routing algorithm increases the throughput to 1351 FPS and 934 FPS respectively. As corroborated by our results, this work enables highly performance-efficient deployment of CapsNets on low-cost FPGA that are popular in modern edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)</p></details> |

Unlike general restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy, which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.</p></details> | Paper Under Review |

SPNv3 is designed and trained to be computationally efficient while providing robustness to spaceborne images that have not been observed during offline training and validation on the ground. These characteristics are essential to deploying NNs on space-grade edge devices. They are achieved through careful NN design choices, and an extensive trade-off analysis reveals features such as data augmentation, transfer learning and vision transformer architecture as a few of those that contribute to simultaneously maximizing robustness and minimizing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that the final SPNv3 can achieve state-of-the-art pose accuracy on hardware-in-the-loop images from a robotic testbed while having trained exclusively on computer-generated synthetic images, effectively bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real imagery. At the same time, SPNv3 runs well above the update frequency of modern satellite navigation filters when tested on a representative graphical processing unit system with flight heritage. Overall, SPNv3 is an efficient, flight-ready NN model readily applicable to close-range rendezvous and proximity operations with target resident space objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets</p></details> |
| **[Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03054v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

Digital Twin (DT) technology, with its various digital capabilities, holds great potential to facilitate the transformation of the communication network from passive responding to proactive adaptation. Thus, in this paper, we propose a multi-layer DT system that coordinates local DT, edge DT, and cloud DT for future network architecture and functions. In our vision, the proposed DT system will not only achieve real-time data-driven decision-making and digital agent functions previously handled by centralized DT, but will do so in a more distributed, mobile, layer-by-layer manner. Moreover, it will supply essential data, pre-trained models, and open interfaces for future metaverse applications, enabling creators and users to efficiently develop and experience metaverse services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Wireless Communications</p></details> |

In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can secure these systems, but a significant challenge in applying FHE to recommendation systems is efficiently handling the inherently large and sparse user-item rating matrices. FHE operations are computationally intensive, and naively processing various sparse matrices in recommendation systems would be prohibitively expensive. Additionally, the communication overhead between parties remains a critical concern in encrypted domains. We propose a novel approach combining Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) representation with FHE-based matrix factorization that efficiently handles matrix sparsity in the encrypted domain while minimizing communication costs. Our experimental results demonstrate high recommendation accuracy with encrypted data while achieving the lowest communication costs, effectively preserving user privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted at the 21st IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience'25) and will be published soon.

However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile, these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive, inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements from prompts.

| **[Bayesian Multivariate Sparse Functional PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03512v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional Principal Components Analysis (FPCA) provides a parsimonious, semi-parametric model for multivariate, sparsely-observed functional data. Frequentist FPCA approaches estimate principal components (PCs) from the data, then condition on these estimates in subsequent analyses. As an alternative, we propose a fully Bayesian inferential framework for multivariate, sparse functional data (MSFAST) which explicitly models the PCs and incorporates their uncertainty. MSFAST builds upon the FAST approach to FPCA for univariate, densely-observed functional data. Like FAST, MSFAST represents PCs using orthonormal splines, samples the orthonormal spline coefficients using parameter expansion, and enforces eigenvalue ordering during model fit. MSFAST extends FAST to multivariate, sparsely-observed data by (1) standardizing each functional covariate to mitigate poor posterior conditioning due to disparate scales; (2) using a better-suited orthogonal spline basis; (3) parallelizing likelihood calculations over covariates; (4) updating parameterizations and priors for computational stability; (5) using a Procrustes-based posterior alignment procedure; and (6) providing efficient prediction routines. We evaluated MSFAST alongside existing implementations using simulations. MSFAST produces uniquely valid inferences and accurate estimates, particularly for smaller signals. MSFAST is motivated by and applied to a study of child growth, with an accompanying vignette illustrating the implementation step-by-step.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures for main text.

| **[Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with uncertainty quantification and model comparison using Bayesian normalizing flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05657v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations can be costly to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can emulate population synthesis runs to enable simulation-based inference from observed catalogs and data augmentation for feature prediction in rarely synthesizable sub-populations. However, flow predictions can be wrought with uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work, we develop a method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by implementing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function naturally associated with density estimators, we sample the posterior distribution of flow parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow uncertainties. We demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, inference, and data-augmentation impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole populations formed through common envelope evolution. We outline the applications of the proposed methodology in the context of simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and feature prediction, with state-of-the-art binary evolution simulators, now marginalized over model and data uncertainties.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid, training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio, missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification, regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.</p></details> | 56 pages |

Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.</p></details> | technical report |

Rip currents are dangerous, fast-moving flows that pose a major risk to beach safety worldwide, making accurate visual detection an important and underexplored research task. The challenge builds on RipVIS, the largest available rip current dataset, and focuses on single-class instance segmentation, where precise delineation is critical to fully capture the extent of rip currents. The dataset spans diverse locations, rip current types, and camera orientations, providing a realistic and challenging benchmark. In total, $75$ participants registered for this first edition, resulting in $5$ valid test submissions. Teams were evaluated on a composite score combining $F_1$, $F_2$, $AP_{50}$, and $AP_{[50:95]}$, ensuring robust and application-relevant rankings. The top-performing methods leveraged deep learning architectures, domain adaptation techniques, pretrained models, and domain generalization strategies to improve performance under diverse conditions. This report outlines the dataset details, competition framework, evaluation metrics, and final results, providing insights into the current state of rip current segmentation.

| **[Efficiently Editing Mixture-of-Experts Models with Compressed Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00634v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become a key approach for scaling large language models efficiently by activating only a subset of experts during training and inference. Typically, the number of activated experts presents a trade-off: fewer experts reduce computational costs, while more experts improve performance. Recent studies reveal that not all activated experts contribute equally to model performance, with some providing minimal utility, particularly when finetuning pretrained MoE models for specialized downstream tasks. The co-existence of significant and redundant parameters in experts provides us an opportunity to reduce the number of activated experts while maintaining model performance. In this work, we propose the concept of compressed experts, lightweight modules that serve as compact representations of full experts. Our approach preserves the most important experts while replacing other auxiliary activated experts with compressed experts. The reduction of active parameters significantly lowers inference costs while achieving comparable performance. Extensive experiments on models including Phi-MoE and OLMoE demonstrate that compressed experts recover over 90% of full expert performance across various tasks while reducing more than 30% active parameters and saving 20% in inference costs. This approach enables efficient deployment of MoE models in resource-constrained settings and facilitates scaling to larger models with manageable overhead.

We propose Robult, a scalable framework designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled (PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2) a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IJCAI 2025 in Montreal, Canada</p></details> |

Traditional approaches such as Discrete Event Simulation (DES) face limitations in terms of computational cost and accuracy. This paper introduces RouteNet-Gauss, a novel integration of a testbed network with a Machine Learning (ML) model to address these challenges. By using the testbed as a hardware accelerator, RouteNet-Gauss generates training datasets rapidly and simulates network scenarios with high fidelity to real-world conditions. Experimental results show that RouteNet-Gauss significantly reduces prediction errors by up to 95% and achieves a 488x speedup in inference time compared to state-of-the-art DES-based methods. RouteNet-Gauss's modular architecture is dynamically constructed based on the specific characteristics of the network scenario, such as topology and routing. This enables it to understand and generalize to different network configurations beyond those seen during training, including networks up to 10x larger. Additionally, it supports Temporal Aggregated Performance Estimation (TAPE), providing configurable temporal granularity and maintaining high accuracy in flow performance metrics. This approach shows promise in improving both simulation efficiency and accuracy, offering a valuable tool for network operators.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

However, gradient reconstruction and membership-inference attacks show that model updates still leak information. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) can address those privacy concerns but it suffers from ciphertext expansion and requires prohibitive overhead on resource-constrained devices. We propose the first Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption (HHE) framework for FL that pairs the PASTA symmetric cipher with the BFV FHE scheme. Clients encrypt local model updates with PASTA and send both the lightweight ciphertexts and the PASTA key (itself BFV-encrypted) to the server, which performs a homomorphic evaluation of the decryption circuit of PASTA and aggregates the resulting BFV ciphertexts. A prototype implementation, developed on top of the Flower FL framework, shows that on independently and identically distributed MNIST dataset with 12 clients and 10 training rounds, the proposed HHE system achieves 97.6% accuracy, just 1.3% below plaintext, while reducing client upload bandwidth by over 2,000x and cutting client runtime by 30% compared to a system based solely on the BFV FHE scheme. However, server computational cost increases by roughly 15621x for each client participating in the training phase, a challenge to be addressed in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 8 figures, To be published in the conference Security and Trust Management(STM), ESORICS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Mechanism Underlying NLP Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03407v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language processing (NLP) enables the understanding and generation of meaningful human language, typically using a pre-trained complex architecture on a large dataset to learn the language and next fine-tune its weights to implement a specific task. Twofold goals are examined; to understand the mechanism underlying successful pre-training and to determine the interplay between the pre-training accuracy and the fine-tuning of classification tasks. The following main results were obtained; the accuracy per token (APT) increased with its appearance frequency in the dataset, and its average over all tokens served as an order parameter to quantify pre-training success, which increased along the transformer blocks. Pre-training broke the symmetry among tokens and grouped them into finite, small, strong match token clusters, as inferred from the presented token confusion matrix. This feature was sharpened along the transformer blocks toward the output layer, enhancing its performance considerably compared with that of the embedding layer. Consequently, higher-order language structures were generated by pre-training, even though the learning cost function was directed solely at identifying a single token. These pre-training findings were reflected by the improved fine-tuning accuracy along the transformer blocks. Additionally, the output label prediction confidence was found to be independent of the average input APT, as the input meaning was preserved since the tokens are replaced primarily by strong match tokens. Finally, although pre-training is commonly absent in image classification tasks, its underlying mechanism is similar to that used in fine-tuning NLP classification tasks, hinting at its universality. The results were based on the BERT-6 architecture pre-trained on the Wikipedia dataset and fine-tuned on the FewRel and DBpedia classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 18 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes, preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach, CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, access to only the denoising kernels is often insufficient. In many applications, we need the knowledge of the marginal densities along the generation trajectory, which enables tasks such as inference-time control. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE). Based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions, it reveals a fundamental connection between marginal densities and transition kernels, providing a flexible plug-and-play framework that unifies diffusion density estimation, inference-time control, and energy-based diffusion training under a single perspective. Experiments demonstrated that RNE delivers strong results in inference-time control applications, such as annealing and model composition, with promising inference-time scaling performance. Moreover, RNE provides a simple yet efficient regularisation for training energy-based diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages; 15 figures; Add more experiments on energy-based training, fix several typos and an error in RNC-TDS paragraph</p></details> |
| **[Variational Uncertainty Decomposition for In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02327v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) gain popularity in conducting prediction tasks in-context, understanding the sources of uncertainty in in-context learning becomes essential to ensuring reliability. The recent hypothesis of in-context learning performing predictive Bayesian inference opens the avenue for Bayesian uncertainty estimation, particularly for decomposing uncertainty into epistemic uncertainty due to lack of in-context data and aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the in-context prediction task. However, the decomposition idea remains under-explored due to the intractability of the latent parameter posterior from the underlying Bayesian model. In this work, we introduce a variational uncertainty decomposition framework for in-context learning without explicitly sampling from the latent parameter posterior, by optimising auxiliary queries as probes to obtain an upper bound to the aleatoric uncertainty of an LLM's in-context learning procedure, which also induces a lower bound to the epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tasks, we show quantitatively and qualitatively that the decomposed uncertainties obtained from our method exhibit desirable properties of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixin...</summary><p>Fixing author order; typo p.20</p></details> |

In this paper, we advocate a new profiled transfer learning framework, ProTrans, to address confounding effects in the target dataset, when additional source datasets that possess similar confounding structures are available. We introduce the concept of profiled residuals to characterize the shared confounding patterns between source and target datasets. By incorporating these profiled residuals into the target debiasing step, we effectively mitigates the latent confounding effects. We also propose a source selection strategy to enhance robustness of ProTrans against noninformative sources. As a byproduct, ProTrans can also be utilized to estimate treatment effects when potential confounders exist, without the use of auxiliary features such as instrumental or proxy variables, which are often challenging to select in practice. Theoretically, we prove that the resulting estimated model shift from sources to target is confounding-free without any assumptions imposed on the true confounding structure, and that the target parameter estimation achieves the minimax optimal rate under mild conditions. Simulated and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ProTrans and support the theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need to further refine this paper</p></details> |

The widespread use of open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences. In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack: a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large, representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> |

However, leveraging such models in a Plug & Play (PnP), zero-shot manner remains challenging because it requires identifying a suitable text prompt for the unknown image of interest. Also, existing text-to-image PnP approaches are highly computationally expensive. We herein address these challenges by proposing a novel PnP inference paradigm specifically designed for embedding generative models within stochastic inverse solvers, with special attention to Latent Consistency Models (LCMs), which distill LDMs into fast generators. We leverage our framework to propose LAtent consisTency INverse sOlver (LATINO), the first zero-shot PnP framework to solve inverse problems with priors encoded by LCMs. Our conditioning mechanism avoids automatic differentiation and reaches SOTA quality in as little as 8 neural function evaluations. As a result, LATINO delivers remarkably accurate solutions and is significantly more memory and computationally efficient than previous approaches. We then embed LATINO within an empirical Bayesian framework that automatically calibrates the text prompt from the observed measurements by marginal maximum likelihood estimation.

| **[Enhancing Natural Language Inference Performance with Knowledge Graph for COVID-19 Automated Fact-Checking in Indonesian Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00061v4)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of ICT Research and Applications (JICTRA)</p></details> |
| **[Interaction-Aware Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contract Bytecodes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20712v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a significant challenge. While numerous tools are available for analyzing smart contracts in source code, only about 1.79% of smart contracts on Ethereum are open-source. For existing tools that target bytecodes, most of them only consider the semantic logic context and disregard function interface information in the bytecodes. In this paper, we propose COBRA, a novel framework that integrates semantic context and function interfaces to detect vulnerabilities in bytecodes of the smart contract. To our best knowledge, COBRA is the first framework that combines these two features. Moreover, to infer the function signatures that are not present in signature databases, we propose SRIF, automatically learn the rules of function signatures from the smart contract bytecodes. The bytecodes associated with the function signatures are collected by constructing a control flow graph (CFG) for the SRIF training. We optimize the semantic context using the operation code in the static single assignment (SSA) format. Finally, we integrate the context and function interface representations in the latent space as the contract feature embedding. The contract features in the hidden space are decoded for vulnerability classifications with a decoder and attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that SRIF can achieve 94.76% F1-score for function signature inference. Furthermore, when the ground truth ABI exists, COBRA achieves 93.45% F1-score for vulnerability classification. In the absence of ABI, the inferred function feature fills the encoder, and the system accomplishes an 89.46% recall rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by TDSC</p></details> |
| **[FinDER: Financial Dataset for Question Answering and Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15800v3)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the fast-paced financial domain, accurate and up-to-date information is critical to addressing ever-evolving market conditions. Retrieving this information correctly is essential in financial Question-Answering (QA), since many language models struggle with factual accuracy in this domain. We present FinDER, an expert-generated dataset tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in finance. Unlike existing QA datasets that provide predefined contexts and rely on relatively clear and straightforward queries, FinDER focuses on annotating search-relevant evidence by domain experts, offering 5,703 query-evidence-answer triplets derived from real-world financial inquiries. These queries frequently include abbreviations, acronyms, and concise expressions, capturing the brevity and ambiguity common in the realistic search behavior of professionals. By challenging models to retrieve relevant information from large corpora rather than relying on readily determined contexts, FinDER offers a more realistic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems. We further present a comprehensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art retrieval models and Large Language Models, showcasing challenges derived from a realistic benchmark to drive future research on truthful and precise RAG in the financial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, ICLR 2025 Workshop Advances in Financial AI</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Learning of Local Updates for Maximum Independent Set in Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13754v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first unsupervised learning model for finding Maximum Independent Sets (MaxIS) in dynamic graphs where edges change over time. Our method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against a mixed integer programming solver and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods for MaxIS on static graphs (ICML 2020; NeurIPS 2020, 2023). Across synthetic and empirical dynamic graphs of 50-1,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning methods in solution quality, runtime, and memory usage. When generalizing to graphs of 10,000 nodes (100x larger than the ones used for training), our model produces MaxIS solutions 1.05-1.18x larger than any other learning method, even while maintaining competitive runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[EverTracer: Hunting Stolen Large Language Models via Stealthy and Robust Probabilistic Fingerprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03058v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified concerns over model theft and license violations, necessitating robust and stealthy ownership verification. Existing fingerprinting methods either require impractical white-box access or introduce detectable statistical anomalies. We propose EverTracer, a novel gray-box fingerprinting framework that ensures stealthy and robust model provenance tracing. EverTracer is the first to repurpose Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) for defensive use, embedding ownership signals via memorization instead of artificial trigger-output overfitting. It consists of Fingerprint Injection, which fine-tunes the model on any natural language data without detectable artifacts, and Verification, which leverages calibrated probability variation signal to distinguish fingerprinted models. This approach remains robust against adaptive adversaries, including input level modification, and model-level modifications. Extensive experiments across architectures demonstrate EverTracer's state-of-the-art effectiveness, stealthness, and resilience, establishing it as a practical solution for securing LLM intellectual property. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/EverTracer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2025 Main</p></details> |
| **[Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03054v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in {-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However, such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007 bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA 3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original 7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90. Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

In industry practice, RTL simulation is divided into two phases: functional debug and system validation. While system validation demands high simulation speed and is typically accelerated using FPGAs, functional debug relies on rapid compilation-rendering multi-core CPUs the primary choice. However, the limited simulation speed of CPUs has become a major bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose CCSS, a scalable multi-core RTL simulation platform that achieves both fast compilation and high simulation throughput. CCSS accelerates combinational logic computation and sequential logic synchronization through specialized architecture and compilation strategies. It employs a balanced DAG partitioning method and efficient boolean computation cores for combinational logic, and adopts a low-latency network-on-chip (NoC) design to synchronize sequential states across cores efficiently. Experimental results show that CCSS delivers up to 12.9x speedup over state-of-the-art multi-core simulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>We pl...</summary><p>We plan to add more experiments and refine the figures in the paper.

| **[Enhancing Diffusion Model Stability for Image Restoration via Gradient Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06656v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum (ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results.

| **[Multimodal learning of melt pool dynamics in laser powder bed fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03029v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process. Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals, using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone. Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has broad applicability in additive manufacturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

The key innovation is a method that transforms binary testing decisions into compound $e-$values, enabling the combination of findings across diverse data sources or studies. We demonstrate that IRT ensures overall false discovery rate (FDR) control, provided the individual studies maintain their respective FDR levels. This approach is highly flexible and is a powerful alternative for fusing inferences in meta-analysis where some studies report summary statistics while the rest reveal only the rejections under a pre-specified FDR level. Extensions to alternative Type I error control measures are explored.</p></details> | Revised version |
| **[Learning a Neural Association Network for Self-supervised Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11514v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework to learn data association for multi-object tracking in a self-supervised manner. Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections.</p></details> | BMVC2025 poster |
| **[Network-Level Prompt and Trait Leakage in Local Research Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20282v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be deployed locally by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit $70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique fingerprinting attacks. Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over 73% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing attack effectiveness by an average of 29%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/umass-aisec/wra</p></details> |

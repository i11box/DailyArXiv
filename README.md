FlowSeek marries the latest advances on the design space of optical flow networks with cutting-edge single-image depth foundation models and classical low-dimensional motion parametrization, implementing a compact, yet accurate architecture. FlowSeek is trained on a single consumer-grade GPU, a hardware budget about 8x lower compared to most recent methods, and still achieves superior cross-dataset generalization on Sintel Final and KITTI, with a relative improvement of 10 and 15% over the previous state-of-the-art SEA-RAFT, as well as on Spring and LayeredFlow datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 - Project Page: https://flowseek25.github.io/ - Code: https://github.com/mattpoggi/flowseek</p></details> |

When running such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the algorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems addressing this, which we call "Quality Control Problems." These problems are specified by a (positive, real-valued) "quality function" $\rho$ and a distribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is "high quality," meaning its $\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept inputs $x \sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$ with $\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker than either component problem: testing for "$\rho(x) \approx 1$" or testing if $x \sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms. In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control problem, where $D \in \Delta(\{0,1\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D ,\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we consider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \binom{n}2$), and the $k$-clique count function $\rho_k := C_k(G)/\mathbb{E}_{G' \sim G_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing if $G \sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to the sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\rho_k(G)\approx 1$ requires $p^{-\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control problem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with respect to $\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing quality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting. More generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\Delta(H)$, the respective quality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\Delta(H))}$ queries and running time.</p></details> | 70 pages |
| **[Simple Yet Effective: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Multi-LLM Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07236v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs, indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance compared to single-model and na\"ive ensemble baselines. In addition, we explore using MUSE as guided signals with chain-of-thought distillation to fine-tune LLMs for calibration. MUSE is available at:https://github.com/LARK-NLP-Lab/MUSE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Conversational Education at Scale: A Multi-LLM Agent Workflow for Procedural Learning and Pedagogic Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05528v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced virtual educators and learners, bridging NLP with AI4Education. Existing work often lacks scalability and fails to leverage diverse, large-scale course content, with limited frameworks for assessing pedagogic quality. To this end, we propose WikiHowAgent, a multi-agent workflow leveraging LLMs to simulate interactive teaching-learning conversations. It integrates teacher and learner agents, an interaction manager, and an evaluator to facilitate procedural learning and assess pedagogic quality. We introduce a dataset of 114,296 teacher-learner conversations grounded in 14,287 tutorials across 17 domains and 727 topics. Our evaluation protocol combines computational and rubric-based metrics with human judgment alignment. Results demonstrate the workflow's effectiveness in diverse setups, offering insights into LLM capabilities across domains. Our datasets and implementations are fully open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Elucidating the Design Space of Decay in Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05282v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions: parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies, scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart. However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies, scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear attention mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

| **[CFaults: Model-Based Diagnosis for Fault Localization in C Programs with Multiple Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09337v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development. Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |
| **[Bridge Modal Identification using Single Moving Sensor under Random Traffic Loading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05277v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing the response recorded by a single moving sensor to identify the modal parameters of a bridge system under different loading conditions, such as known excitation and unknown random traffic-induced vibrations. The sensor traverses the bridge and captures its dynamic response (acceleration). The natural frequencies and damping ratios are identified using the moving sensor data in the frequency domain. In the case of known inputs, these parameters are then used to obtain the mode shapes, expressed as a linear combination of basic orthonormal polynomials (BOPs), with the coefficients of the BOPs in the linear combinations obtained via optimization. A statistical formulation is proposed to estimate the mode shapes in the case of unknown random traffic-induced vibrations, including the effect of road roughness. It is shown that the absolute value of the mode shapes are proportional to the ensemble standard deviation (SD) of the modal responses. This approach requires the sensor to traverse the bridge multiple times, with the mode shapes identified in both the time domain using variances, and in frequency domain through the evolutionary power spectrum of these responses. The random traffic loading is modeled such that vehicle arrival times follow a Poisson distribution, while the mass and velocity of the vehicles are assumed to follow uniform distributions. To incorporate the effect of road roughness, modeled as a homogeneous random field, a vehicle-bridge-interaction (VBI) model is utilized. Numerical validation under the different loading conditions demonstrates that a single moving sensor can be used to identify the modal parameters quite accurately, with high spatial resolution of the identified mode shapes, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative for bridge health monitoring.</p></details> | 56 pages, 18 figures |
| **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v7)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by up to 12% on MSE and 6% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Greener Deep Reinforcement Learning: Analysis of Energy and Carbon Efficiency Across Atari Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05273v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C, ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage, CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs. RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance. This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a journal - under review</p></details> |
| **[NISE-PE Constraint: Data-Driven Predictive Control with Persistence of Excitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04548v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Persistence of excitation (PE) is an important requirement for the successful operation of data-driven predictive control, as it ensures that the input-output data contains sufficient information about the underlying system dynamics. Nonetheless, this property is usually assumed rather than guaranteed. This paper introduces a novel data-driven predictive control formulation that maintains PE. The technical development that allows this is the characterisation of the nonexciting input set (NIS), i.e., the set of inputs that lead to loss of PE, and the consequent derivation of a pair of disjoint, linear inequality constraints on the input, termed NIS exclusion PE (NIS-PE) constraint, that, if satisfied, maintain PE. When used in a predictive control formulation, these constraints lead to a mixed-integer optimal control problem with a single binary variable or, equivalently, a pair of disjoint quadratic programming problems that can be efficiently and reliably solved. Numerical examples show how these constraints are able to maintain PE during the controller's operation, resulting in improved performance over conventional approaches for both time-invariant and time-varying systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures.

| **[DiMo-GUI: Advancing Test-time Scaling in GUI Grounding via Modality-Aware Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00008v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies: dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Arg-LLaDA: Argument Summarization via Large Language Diffusion Models and Sufficiency-Aware Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19081v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported, redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Inferring Change Points in High-Dimensional Regression via Approximate Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07864v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of localizing change points in a generalized linear model (GLM), a model that covers many widely studied problems in statistical learning including linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression. We propose a novel and computationally efficient Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations, and rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional limit where the number of parameters $p$ is proportional to the number of samples $n$. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which allows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic Hausdorff error of our change point estimates, and allows us to tailor the algorithm to take advantage of any prior structural information on the signals and change points. Moreover, we show how our AMP iterates can be used to efficiently compute a Bayesian posterior distribution over the change point locations in the high-dimensional limit. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic and real data in the settings of linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 9 figures.

| **[A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Interpretable Cyberattack Detection in AGC Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05259v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems, considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.</p></details> | Peer-reviewed |

Generative models can fill-in missing or corrupted details based on their strong prior understanding of the data domain. We present a system for editing individual sound events within complex scenes able to delete, insert, and enhance individual sound events based on textual edit descriptions (e.g., ``enhance Door'') and a graphical representation of the event timing derived from an ``event roll'' transcription. We present an encoder-decoder transformer working on SoundStream representations, trained on synthetic (input, desired output) audio example pairs formed by adding isolated sound events to dense, real-world backgrounds. Evaluation reveals the importance of each part of the edit descriptions -- action, class, timing. Our work demonstrates ``recomposition'' is an important and practical application.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Computing Lindahl Equilibrium for Public Goods with and without Funding Caps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16414v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lindahl equilibrium is a solution concept for allocating a fixed budget across several divisible public goods. It always lies in the weak core, meaning that the equilibrium allocation satisfies desirable stability and proportional fairness properties. We consider a model where agents have separable linear utility functions over the public goods, and the output assigns to each good an amount of spending, summing to at most the available budget. In the uncapped setting, each of the public goods can absorb any amount of funding. In this case, it is known that Lindahl equilibrium is equivalent to maximizing Nash social welfare, and this allocation can be computed by a public-goods variant of the proportional response dynamics. We introduce a new convex programming formulation for computing this solution and show that it is related to Nash welfare maximization through double duality and reformulation. We then show that the proportional response dynamics is equivalent to running mirror descent on our new formulation. Our new formulation has similarities to Shmyrev's convex program for Fisher market equilibrium. In the capped setting, each public good has an upper bound on the amount of funding it can receive, which is a type of constraint that appears in fractional committee selection and participatory budgeting. In this setting, existence of Lindahl equilibrium was only known via fixed-point arguments. The existence of an efficient algorithm computing one has been a long-standing open question. We prove that our new convex program continues to work when the cap constraints are added, and its optimal solutions are Lindahl equilibria. Thus, we establish that approximate Lindahl equilibrium can be efficiently computed. Our result also implies that approximately core-stable allocations can be efficiently computed for the class of separable piecewise-linear concave (SPLC) utilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Thoro...</summary><p>Thoroughly revised version with new sections on convergence rates (Sec. 4.6) and on approximately optimal solutions (Sec. 5.3)</p></details> |
| **[Structure of sparse Boolean functions over Abelian groups, and its application to testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18700v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Fourier-sparse Boolean functions over general finite Abelian groups. A Boolean function $f : \mathcal{G} \to \{-1,+1\}$ is $s$-sparse if it has at most $s$ non-zero Fourier coefficients. We introduce a general notion of \emph{granularity} of Fourier coefficients and prove that every non-zero coefficient of an $s$-sparse Boolean function has magnitude at least \[ \frac{1}{2^{\varphi(\lcmG)/2} \, s^{\varphi(\lcmG)/2}}, \] where $\Delta$ denotes the exponent of the group $\mathcal{G}$ (that is, the maximum order of an element in $\mathcal{G}$) and $\varphi$ is the Euler's totient function. This generalizes the celebrated result of Gopalan et al. (SICOMP 2011) for $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$, extending it to all finite Abelian groups via new techniques from group theory and algebraic number theory. Using our new structural results on the Fourier coefficients of sparse functions, we design an efficient sparsity testing algorithm for Boolean functions. The tester distinguishes whether a given function is $s$-sparse or $\epsilon$-far from every $s$-sparse Boolean function, with query complexity $poly\left((2s)^{\varphi(\lcmG)},1/\epsilon \right)$. In addition, we generalize the classical notion of Boolean degree to arbitrary Abelian groups and establish an $\Omega(\sqrt{s})$ lower bound for adaptive sparsity testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work generalizes our MFCS 2024 paper, "On Fourier Analysis of Sparse Boolean Functions over Certain Abelian Groups'', in which we studied sparse Boolean functions on groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1}^{n_1} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_t}^{n_t}$ with distinct primes $p_i$</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Network Defense](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17351v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have created opportunities to solve complex real-world tasks. Cybersecurity is a notable application area, where defending networks against sophisticated adversaries remains a challenging task typically performed by teams of security operators. In this work, we explore novel MARL strategies for building autonomous cyber network defenses that address challenges such as large policy spaces, partial observability, and stealthy, deceptive adversarial strategies. To facilitate efficient and generalized learning, we propose a hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) architecture that decomposes the cyber defense task into specific sub-tasks like network investigation and host recovery. Our approach involves training sub-policies for each sub-task using PPO enhanced with cybersecurity domain expertise. These sub-policies are then leveraged by a master defense policy that coordinates their selection to solve complex network defense tasks. Furthermore, the sub-policies can be fine-tuned and transferred with minimal cost to defend against shifts in adversarial behavior or changes in network settings. We conduct extensive experiments using CybORG Cage 4, the state-of-the-art MARL environment for cyber defense. Comparisons with multiple baselines across different adversaries show that our hierarchical learning approach achieves top performance in terms of convergence speed, episodic return, and several interpretable metrics relevant to cybersecurity, including the fraction of clean machines on the network, precision, and false positives.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, RLC Paper</p></details> |

To address this issue, we introduce COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28 interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to support continued research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 ma...</summary><p>10 main pages, 3 figure, appendix available</p></details> |

Existing works have explored injecting watermarks into local models to enable intellectual property protection. However, these methods either focus on non-traceable watermarks or traceable but white-box watermarks. We identify a gap in the literature regarding the formal definition of traceable black-box watermarking and the formulation of the problem of injecting such watermarks into FL systems. In this work, we first formalize the problem of injecting traceable black-box watermarks into FL. Based on the problem, we propose a novel server-side watermarking method, $\mathbf{TraMark}$, which creates a traceable watermarked model for each client, enabling verification of model leakage in black-box settings. To achieve this, $\mathbf{TraMark}$ partitions the model parameter space into two distinct regions: the main task region and the watermarking region. Subsequently, a personalized global model is constructed for each client by aggregating only the main task region while preserving the watermarking region. Each model then learns a unique watermark exclusively within the watermarking region using a distinct watermark dataset before being sent back to the local client. Extensive results across various FL systems demonstrate that $\mathbf{TraMark}$ ensures the traceability of all watermarked models while preserving their main task performance.</p></details> | Preprint |

| **[First Steps Towards Overhearing LLM Agents: A Case Study With Dungeons & Dragons Gameplay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22809v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much work has been done on conversational LLM agents which directly assist human users with tasks. We present an alternative paradigm for interacting with LLM agents, which we call "overhearing agents". These overhearing agents do not actively participate in conversation -- instead, they "listen in" on human-to-human conversations and perform background tasks or provide suggestions to assist the user. In this work, we explore the overhearing agents paradigm through the lens of Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. We present an in-depth study using large multimodal audio-language models as overhearing agents to assist a Dungeon Master. We perform a human evaluation to examine the helpfulness of such agents and find that some large audio-language models have the emergent ability to perform overhearing agent tasks using implicit audio cues.

In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp, while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |

We present a framework for difficulty-aware reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO) preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.</p></details> | 28 Pages |

However, evaluating how faithfully these agents adhere to their personas remains a significant challenge, particularly in free-form settings that demand consistency across diverse, persona-relevant environments. We introduce PersonaGym, the first dynamic evaluation framework for persona agents, and PersonaScore, a human-aligned automatic metric grounded in decision theory that enables comprehensive large-scale evaluation. Our evaluation of 10 leading LLMs across 200 personas and 10,000 questions reveals significant advancement opportunities. For example, GPT-4.1 had the exact same PersonaScore as LLaMA-3-8b despite being a more recent and advanced closed source model. Importantly, increased model size and complexity do not necessarily enhance persona agent capabilities, underscoring the need for algorithmic and architectural innovation toward faithful, performant persona agents.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |

Portable programming models exist, but they require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for different hardware architectures. Large language models (LLMs) may help to reduce this programmer burden. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of programming models and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness, categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling to larger codebases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, their theoretical analysis remains a challenge, especially in complex settings like reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce Q-Learning with Posterior Sampling (PSQL), a simple Q-learning-based algorithm that uses Gaussian posteriors on Q-values for exploration, akin to the popular Thompson Sampling algorithm in the multi-armed bandit setting. We show that in the tabular episodic MDP setting, PSQL achieves a regret bound of $\tilde O(H^2\sqrt{SAT})$, closely matching the known lower bound of $\Omega(H\sqrt{SAT})$. Here, S, A denote the number of states and actions in the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), and $T=KH$ with $K$ being the number of episodes and $H$ being the planning horizon. Our work provides several new technical insights into the core challenges in combining posterior sampling with dynamic programming and TD-learning-based RL algorithms, along with novel ideas for resolving those difficulties. We hope this will form a starting point for analyzing this efficient and important algorithmic technique in even more complex RL settings.</p></details> | bugs fixed |

Existing mitigation strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |

We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (32 pages, 12 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/SGP-Gen/)</p></details> |

However, due to the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to 3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2505.10806</p></details> |

Our survey illuminates gaps in the field's dominant methodological design choices (e.g., preference for certain languages, scarcity of multilingual mitigation experiments) while cataloging common issues encountered and solutions implemented in adapting bias benchmarks across languages and cultures. Drawing from the implications of our findings, we chart directions for future research that can reinforce the multilingual bias literature's inclusivity, cross-cultural appropriateness, and alignment with state-of-the-art NLP advancements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

Web service traffic is characterized by frequent and drastic fluctuations over time and are influenced by heterogeneous web user behaviors, making accurate prediction a challenging task. Previous research has extensively explored statistical approaches, and neural networks to mine features from preceding service traffic time series for prediction. However, these methods have largely overlooked the causal relationships between services. Drawing inspiration from causality in ecological systems, we empirically recognize the causal relationships between web services. To leverage these relationships for improved web service traffic prediction, we propose an effective neural network module, CCMPlus, designed to extract causal relationship features across services. This module can be seamlessly integrated with existing time series models to consistently enhance the performance of web service traffic predictions. We theoretically justify that the causal correlation matrix generated by the CCMPlus module captures causal relationships among services. Empirical results on real-world datasets from Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Group, and Ant Group confirm that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for predicting service traffic time series. These findings highlight the efficacy of leveraging causal relationships for improved predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>time ...</summary><p>time series, web service, web traffic, causality, more experiments</p></details> |

Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs, do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of agentic LLMs. We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing, evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings. Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services, showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and stakeholder roles. By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways, TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice, supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of agentic AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 9 tables and 2 figures</p></details> |

However, the commonly used ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably, Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model efficiency for 3D point cloud classification.

Generative models can fill-in missing or corrupted details based on their strong prior understanding of the data domain. We present a system for editing individual sound events within complex scenes able to delete, insert, and enhance individual sound events based on textual edit descriptions (e.g., ``enhance Door'') and a graphical representation of the event timing derived from an ``event roll'' transcription. We present an encoder-decoder transformer working on SoundStream representations, trained on synthetic (input, desired output) audio example pairs formed by adding isolated sound events to dense, real-world backgrounds. Evaluation reveals the importance of each part of the edit descriptions -- action, class, timing. Our work demonstrates ``recomposition'' is an important and practical application.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

To address this issue, we introduce COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28 interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to support continued research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 ma...</summary><p>10 main pages, 3 figure, appendix available</p></details> |

While traditional machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used, they struggle to capture spatial dependencies and poor boundary delineation between susceptibility classes. This study introduces the first application of a graph transformer (GT) architecture for flood susceptibility mapping to the flood-prone French Riviera (e.g., 2020 Storm Alex) using topography, hydrology, geography, and environmental data. GT incorporates watershed topology using Laplacian positional encoders (PEs) and attention mechanisms. The developed GT model has an AUC-ROC (0.9739), slightly lower than XGBoost (0.9853). However, the GT model demonstrated better clustering and delineation with a higher Moran's I value (0.6119) compared to the random forest (0.5775) and XGBoost (0.5311) with p-value lower than 0.0001. Feature importance revealed a striking consistency across models, with elevation, slope, distance to channel, and convergence index being the critical factors. Dimensionality reduction on Laplacian PEs revealed partial clusters, indicating they could capture spatial information; however, their importance was lower than flood factors. Since climate and land use changes aggravate flood risk, susceptibility maps are developed for the 2050 year under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and railway track vulnerability is assessed. All RCP scenarios revealed increased area across susceptibility classes, except for the very low category. RCP 8.5 projections indicate that 17.46% of the watershed area and 54% of railway length fall within very-high susceptible zones, compared to 6.19% and 35.61%, respectively, under current conditions. The developed maps can be integrated into a multi-hazard framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

The method combines a one-time, offline-trained quantum generative model with a classical autoregressive predictor for spatiotemporal field generation. The quantum model learns a quantum prior (Q-Prior) that guides the representation of small-scale interactions and improves the modeling of fine-scale dynamics. We evaluate QIML on three representative systems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and a cross-section of fully developed three-dimensional turbulent channel flow used as a realistic inflow condition. Compared to the classical baseline, QIML yields up to 17.25% improvement in predictive distribution accuracy and a 29.36% improvement in the fidelity of the predicted full energy spectrum. For turbulent channel inflow, the Q-Prior is essential: without it, the model fails to evolve in time, while QIML produces stable, physically consistent forecasts that surpass leading machine learning models for PDEs, including the Fourier Neural Operator and Markov Neural Operator, whose errors diverge. Beyond accuracy, QIML also achieves a memory advantage, compressing multi-megabyte datasets into a kilobyte-scale Q-Prior that captures only the invariant measure needed to guide the classical model, thus circumventing Holevo's bound by avoiding full data reconstruction. Our findings provide a practical and scalable pathway for integrating the advantages brought by quantum devices into large-scale scientific, engineering modeling and simulation.</p></details> | 41 pages, 15 figures |

In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer (MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration.

We present the first large-scale empirical study of ten state-of-the-art TPL detection techniques across over 6,000 apps, enabled by a new ground truth dataset with precise version-level annotations for both remote and local dependencies. Our evaluation exposes tool fragility to R8-era transformations, weak version discrimination, inaccurate correspondence of candidate libraries, difficulty in generalizing similarity thresholds, and prohibitive runtime/memory overheads at scale. Beyond tool assessment, we further analyze how TPLs shape downstream tasks, including vulnerability analysis, malware detection, secret leakage assessment, and LLM-based evaluation. From this perspective, our study provides concrete insights into how TPL characteristics affect these tasks and informs future improvements in security analysis.</p></details> | 20pages, 7figures |

These factors make it difficult to resolve ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e., BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings. Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1) continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation, and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than boost accuracy.

| **[Ground-Aware Octree-A* Hybrid Path Planning for Memory-Efficient 3D Navigation of Ground Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04950v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a 3D path planning method that integrates the A* algorithm with the octree structure. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and legged robots have been extensively studied, enabling locomotion across a variety of terrains. Advances in mobility have enabled obstacles to be regarded not only as hindrances to be avoided, but also as navigational aids when beneficial. A modified 3D A* algorithm generates an optimal path by leveraging obstacles during the planning process. By incorporating a height-based penalty into the cost function, the algorithm enables the use of traversable obstacles to aid locomotion while avoiding those that are impassable, resulting in more efficient and realistic path generation. The octree-based 3D grid map achieves compression by merging high-resolution nodes into larger blocks, especially in obstacle-free or sparsely populated areas. This reduces the number of nodes explored by the A* algorithm, thereby improving computational efficiency and memory usage, and supporting real-time path planning in practical environments. Benchmark results demonstrate that the use of octree structure ensures an optimal path while significantly reducing memory usage and computation time.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures.

The dataset comprises 103 whole-slide images with expert pixel-level annotations for five tissue classes. Participants submitted segmentation masks via Codalab, evaluated using metrics such as macro F-score and mIoU.

While prior work has advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states. Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM agent interaction behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Long Paper)</p></details> |

Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://perfectxu88.github.io/KDP-AD/</p></details> |

Unlike conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based methods, QFT provides a unitary transformation with global phase coherence and energy preservation, enabling improved discrimination between speech and noise. The proposed approach replaces FFT in Wiener and spectral subtraction filters with a QFT operator, ensuring consistent hyperparameter settings for fair comparison. Experiments on clean speech, synthetic tones, and noisy mixtures across diverse signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions, demonstrate statistically significant gains in SNR, with up to 15 dB improvement and reduced artifact generation. Results confirm that QFT based denoising offers robustness under low SNR and nonstationary noise scenarios without additional computational overhead, highlighting its potential as a scalable pathway toward quantum-enhanced speech processing.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Histogram Driven Amplitude Embedding for Qubit Efficient Quantum Image Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04849v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Automated classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures, demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer, achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review in ICSigSys 2025</p></details> |

Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and (2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence - PRICAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Entropy stable finite difference methods via entropy correction artificial viscosity and knapsack limiting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21226v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of computational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a discrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. Schemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave much more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a new strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity preserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in order to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity preserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction artificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy inequality. In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial viscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve high order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and are hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme provably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance tradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2507.14488</p></details> |

Recent works have shown remarkable progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds, meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings. The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence, and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

As users increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models, especially in review generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing 62% fewer parameters.

To improve content encoding under strict latency constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving real-time speech communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ASRU 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Surformer v2, an enhanced multi-modal classification architecture designed to integrate visual and tactile sensory streams through a late(decision level) fusion mechanism. Building on our earlier Surformer v1 framework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by mid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer v2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts to late fusion. The vision branch leverages a CNN-based classifier(Efficient V-Net), while the tactile branch employs an encoder-only transformer model, allowing each modality to extract modality-specific features optimized for classification. Rather than merging feature maps, the model performs decision-level fusion by combining the output logits using a learnable weighted sum, enabling adaptive emphasis on each modality depending on data context and training dynamics. We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a multi-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that Surformer v2 performs well, maintaining competitive inference speed, suitable for real-time robotic applications. These findings underscore the effectiveness of decision-level fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling for enhancing surface understanding in multi-modal robotic perception.</p></details> | 6 pages |

In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies: dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

We propose a novel and computationally efficient Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for estimating both the signals and the change point locations, and rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional limit where the number of parameters $p$ is proportional to the number of samples $n$. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which allows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic Hausdorff error of our change point estimates, and allows us to tailor the algorithm to take advantage of any prior structural information on the signals and change points. Moreover, we show how our AMP iterates can be used to efficiently compute a Bayesian posterior distribution over the change point locations in the high-dimensional limit. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic and real data in the settings of linear, logistic, and rectified linear regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 9 figures.

We present a framework for difficulty-aware reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO) preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.</p></details> | 28 Pages |

Portable programming models exist, but they require significant developer effort to port to and optimize for different hardware architectures. Large language models (LLMs) may help to reduce this programmer burden. In this paper, we present a novel benchmark and testing framework, ParEval-Repo, which can be used to evaluate the efficacy of LLM-based approaches in automatically translating entire codebases across GPGPU execution models. ParEval-Repo includes several scientific computing and AI mini-applications in a range of programming models and levels of repository complexity. We use ParEval-Repo to evaluate a range of state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs, with both a non-agentic and a top-down agentic approach. We assess code generated by the LLMs and approaches in terms of compilability, functional correctness, categories of build errors, and the cost of translation in terms of the number of inference tokens. Our results demonstrate that LLM translation of scientific applications is feasible for small programs but difficulty with generating functional build systems and cross-file dependencies pose challenges in scaling to larger codebases.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost. Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference (Oral)</p></details> |

Trained on a diverse set of datasets of initial and boundary conditions paired with corresponding solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs), ICON learns to map example condition-solution pairs of a given differential equation to an approximation of its solution operator. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that reveals ICON as implicitly performing Bayesian inference, where it computes the mean of the posterior predictive distribution over solution operators conditioned on the provided context, i.e., example condition-solution pairs. The formalism of random differential equations provides the probabilistic framework for describing the tasks ICON accomplishes while also providing a basis for understanding other multi-operator learning methods. This probabilistic perspective provides a basis for extending ICON to \emph{generative} settings, where one can sample from the posterior predictive distribution of solution operators. The generative formulation of ICON (GenICON) captures the underlying uncertainty in the solution operator, which enables principled uncertainty quantification in the solution predictions in operator learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

However, network and storage latencies cannot decrease at a similar pace due to physical constraints, leading to data stalls, and creating a bottleneck for DL tasks. Additionally, managing vast quantities of data and their associated metadata has proven challenging, hampering and slowing the productivity of data scientists. Moreover, existing data loaders have limited network support, necessitating, for maximum performance, that data be stored on local filesystems close to the GPUs, overloading the storage of computing nodes. In this paper we propose a strategy, aimed at DL image applications, to address these challenges by: storing data and metadata in fast, scalable NoSQL databases; connecting the databases to state-of-the-art loaders for DL frameworks; enabling high-throughput data loading over high-latency networks through our out-of-order, incremental prefetching techniques. To evaluate our approach, we showcase our implementation and assess its data loading capabilities through local, medium and high-latency (intercontinental) experiments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Fast-track procedures offer the potential for earlier patient access to innovative products. They involve two registration steps. The applicants can apply first for conditional registration. A successful conditional registration provides a limited funding or approval period and time to prepare the application for permanent registration, which is the second step of the registration process. For conditional registration, typically, products have to fulfil only a part of the requirements necessary for permanent registration. There is interest in valid and efficient study designs for fast-track procedures. This will be addressed in this paper. A motivating example of the paper is the German fast-track registration process of digital health applications (DiGA) for reimbursement by statutory health insurances. The main focus of the paper is the systematic investigation of the utility of adaptive designs in the context of fast-track registration processes. The paper also covers a careful discussion of the different requirements found in the guidelines and their consequences. We demonstrate that the use of adaptive designs in the context of fast-track processes like the DiGA registration process is, in most cases, much more efficient than the current standard of two separate studies.

These agents are typically fine-tuned using small-scale, user-collected data, making them susceptible to stealthy training-time threats. This work introduces VIBMA, the first clean-text backdoor attack targeting VLM-based mobile agents. The attack injects malicious behaviors into the model by modifying only the visual input while preserving textual prompts and instructions, achieving stealth through the complete absence of textual anomalies. Once the agent is fine-tuned on this poisoned data, adding a predefined visual pattern (trigger) at inference time activates the attacker-specified behavior (backdoor). Our attack aligns the training gradients of poisoned samples with those of an attacker-specified target instance, effectively embedding backdoor-specific features into the poisoned data. To ensure the robustness and stealthiness of the attack, we design three trigger variants that better resemble real-world scenarios: static patches, dynamic motion patterns, and low-opacity blended content. Extensive experiments on six Android applications and three mobile-compatible VLMs demonstrate that our attack achieves high success rates (ASR up to 94.67%) while preserving clean-task behavior (FSR up to 95.85%). We further conduct ablation studies to understand how key design factors impact attack reliability and stealth. These findings is the first to reveal the security vulnerabilities of mobile agents and their susceptibility to backdoor injection, underscoring the need for robust defenses in mobile agent adaptation pipelines.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</p></details> | Under review |

To address this challenge, we aim to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted, context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents' goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors, Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed - leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate, shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://www.matteobortoletto.org/protom/</p></details> |

We explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust. As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the STREAM workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Here, we introduce a large-scale, code-submission-based competition comprising two challenges. First, the Transfer Challenge asks participants to build and test a model that can zero-shot decode new tasks and new subjects from their EEG data. Second, the Psychopathology factor prediction Challenge asks participants to infer subject measures of mental health from EEG data. For this, we use an unprecedented, multi-terabyte dataset of high-density EEG signals (128 channels) recorded from over 3,000 child to young adult subjects engaged in multiple active and passive tasks. We provide several tunable neural network baselines for each of these two challenges, including a simple network and demographic-based regression models. Developing models that generalise across tasks and individuals will pave the way for ML network architectures capable of adapting to EEG data collected from diverse tasks and individuals. Similarly, predicting mental health-relevant personality trait values from EEG might identify objective biomarkers useful for clinical diagnosis and design of personalised treatment for psychological conditions. Ultimately, the advances spurred by this challenge could contribute to the development of computational psychiatry and useful neurotechnology, and contribute to breakthroughs in both fundamental neuroscience and applied clinical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appro...</summary><p>Approved at Neurips Competition track. webpage: https://eeg2025.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01807v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. Probabilistic guarantees for its validity with respect to the true, unknown system are obtained by testing on an additional set of posterior samples. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of the 64th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization, thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement, enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH, demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of sticker-guided historical experience utilization.

Assuming that the missingness mechanism depends only on the covariates (missing at random assumption), we present two estimators for the functional mean parameter, using working models for the functional outcome given the covariates, and the probability of missingness given the covariates. We contribute by establishing that both these estimators have Gaussian processes as limiting distributions and explicitly give their covariance functions. One of the estimators is double robust in the sense that the limiting distribution holds whenever at least one of the nuisance models is correctly specified. These results allow us to present simultaneous confidence bands for the mean function with asymptotically guaranteed coverage. A Monte Carlo study shows the finite sample properties of the proposed functional estimators and their associated simultaneous inference. The use of the method is illustrated in an application where the mean of counterfactual outcomes is targeted.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages incl appendices</p></details> |
| **[Learning Multidimensional Urban Poverty Representation with Satellite Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04958v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the inference of urban socioeconomic characteristics from satellite imagery. However, models relying solely on urbanization traits often show weak correlations with poverty indicators, as unplanned urban growth can obscure economic disparities and spatial inequalities. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel representation learning framework that captures multidimensional deprivation-related traits from very high-resolution satellite imagery for precise urban poverty mapping. Our approach integrates three complementary traits: (1) accessibility traits, learned via contrastive learning to encode proximity to essential infrastructure; (2) morphological traits, derived from building footprints to reflect housing conditions in informal settlements; and (3) economic traits, inferred from nightlight intensity as a proxy for economic activity. To mitigate spurious correlations - such as those from non-residential nightlight sources that misrepresent poverty conditions - we incorporate a backdoor adjustment mechanism that leverages morphological traits during training of the economic module. By fusing these complementary features into a unified representation, our framework captures the complex nature of poverty, which often diverges from economic development trends. Evaluations across three capital cities - Cape Town, Dhaka, and Phnom Penh - show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a robust tool for poverty mapping and policy support in data-scarce regions.</p></details> | 10 pages |

As financial transaction data streams grow in scale and complexity, traditional methods often require large labeled datasets, struggle with time series of irregular sampling frequencies and varying sequence lengths. To address these challenges, we extend conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for targeted data augmentation, integrate Bayesian inference to obtain predictive distributions and quantify uncertainty, and leverage log-signatures for robust feature encoding of transaction histories. We introduce a novel Wasserstein distance-based loss to align generated and real unlabeled samples while simultaneously maximizing classification accuracy on labeled data. Our approach is evaluated on the BankSim dataset, a widely used simulator for credit card transaction data, under varying proportions of labeled samples, demonstrating consistent improvements over benchmarks in both global statistical and domain-specific metrics. These findings highlight the effectiveness of GAN-driven semi-supervised learning with log-signatures for irregularly sampled time series and emphasize the importance of uncertainty-aware predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated references in v2</p></details> |

These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks, reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and automated evaluation.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike conventional Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based methods, QFT provides a unitary transformation with global phase coherence and energy preservation, enabling improved discrimination between speech and noise. The proposed approach replaces FFT in Wiener and spectral subtraction filters with a QFT operator, ensuring consistent hyperparameter settings for fair comparison. Experiments on clean speech, synthetic tones, and noisy mixtures across diverse signal to noise ratio (SNR) conditions, demonstrate statistically significant gains in SNR, with up to 15 dB improvement and reduced artifact generation. Results confirm that QFT based denoising offers robustness under low SNR and nonstationary noise scenarios without additional computational overhead, highlighting its potential as a scalable pathway toward quantum-enhanced speech processing.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Assumption-Lean Post-Integrated Inference with Surrogate Control Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04996v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings from high-dimensional outcomes to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, across heterogeneous datasets. However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity using control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects using negative control outcomes. By utilizing surrogate control outcomes as an extension of negative control outcomes, we develop semiparametric inference on projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated with random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with potential unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages for the main text, 32 pages for the appendix, 6 figures for the main text, 7 figures for the appendix</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Speculative Agent Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01920v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%. Our code and data are available through https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

However, these models are vulnerable to misuse, particularly generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as sexually explicit, violent, political, and disturbing images, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. We further enhance its reliability and helpfulness through a divide-and-conquer strategy, which optimizes category-specific soft prompts and combines them into holistic safety guidance. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 3.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Latent Class Bayesian Model for Multivariate Longitudinal Outcomes with Excess Zeros](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04804v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent class models have been successfully used to handle complex datasets in different disciplines. For longitudinal outcomes, we often get a trajectory of the outcome for each individual, and on that basis, we cluster them for a powerful statistical inference. Latent class models have been used to handle multivariate longitudinal outcomes coming from biology, health sciences, and economics. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian latent class model for multivariate outcomes with excess zeros. We consider a Tobit model for zero-inflated continuous outcomes such as out-of-pocket medical expenses (OOPME), a two-part model for financial debt, and a ZIP model for counting outcomes with excess zeros. We develop a Bayesian mixture model and employ an adaptive Lasso-type shrinkage method for variable selection. We analyze data from the Health and Retirement Study conducted by the University of Michigan and consider modeling four important outcomes measuring the physical and financial health of the aged individuals. Our analysis detects several latent clusters for different outcomes. Practical usefulness of the proposed model is validated through a simulation study.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

Recent CLIP-based approaches have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG, which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim 3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

Surveillance cameras are often installed around buildings to detect falling objects, but such detection remains challenging due to the small size and fast motion of the objects. Moreover, the field of falling object detection around buildings (FODB) lacks a large-scale dataset for training learning-based detection methods and for standardized evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a large and diverse video benchmark dataset named FADE. Specifically, FADE contains 2,611 videos from 25 scenes, featuring 8 falling object categories, 4 weather conditions, and 4 video resolutions. Additionally, we develop a novel detection method for FODB that effectively leverages motion information and generates small-sized yet high-quality detection proposals. The efficacy of our method is evaluated on the proposed FADE dataset by comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches in generic object detection, video object detection, and moving object detection.

We perform our regressions on several years of data from Lichess, the free and open-source internet chess server. We use the published player ratings to control for the confounding effect of differential player skill. We adjust for the attenuation bias in regressions due to the noise in observed ratings. We find that major piece values, relative to the value of a pawn, are fairly consistent with historical valuation systems. However we find slightly higher value to bishops than knights. We find that piece values are smaller, in absolute value, in Atomic and Antichess than standard chess. We also present approximate values of the pieces to equalize odds when players of varying skill face off.</p></details> | 53 pages |

Finally, DarkStream anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving real-time speech communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ASRU 2025</p></details> |

We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute as Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time into reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group of parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current policy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy) reconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra inference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two regimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers; (ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria scored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction satisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge scores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all rollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a test-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up to +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning (CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained policy surpassing the initial teacher signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Cin√©aste: A Fine-grained Contextual Movie Question Answering Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14227v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions, scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for advancements in long-form movie comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[MAVL: A Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Dataset for Animated Song Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18614v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lyrics translation requires both accurate semantic transfer and preservation of musical rhythm, syllabic structure, and poetic style. In animated musicals, the challenge intensifies due to alignment with visual and auditory cues. We introduce Multilingual Audio-Video Lyrics Benchmark for Animated Song Translation (MAVL), the first multilingual, multimodal benchmark for singable lyrics translation. By integrating text, audio, and video, MAVL enables richer and more expressive translations than text-only approaches. Building on this, we propose Syllable-Constrained Audio-Video LLM with Chain-of-Thought SylAVL-CoT, which leverages audio-video cues and enforces syllabic constraints to produce natural-sounding lyrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SylAVL-CoT significantly outperforms text-based models in singability and contextual accuracy, emphasizing the value of multimodal, multilingual approaches for lyrics translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025, Project Page: https://k1064190.github.io/papers/paper1.html, our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/k1064190/MAVL</p></details> |
| **[Defending Diffusion Models Against Membership Inference Attacks via Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14225v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Off-Policy Inference for M-Estimators Under Model Misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14218v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When data are collected adaptively, such as in bandit algorithms, classical statistical approaches such as ordinary least squares and $M$-estimation will often fail to achieve asymptotic normality. Although recent lines of work have modified the classical approaches to ensure valid inference on adaptively collected data, most of these works assume that the model is correctly specified. We propose a method that provides valid inference for M-estimators that use adaptively collected bandit data with a (possibly) misspecified working model. A key ingredient in our approach is the use of flexible machine learning approaches to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data collection. A major novelty is that our procedure enables the construction of valid confidence sets even in settings where treatment policies are unstable and non-converging, such as when there is no unique optimal arm and standard bandit algorithms are used. Empirical results on semi-synthetic datasets constructed from the Osteoarthritis Initiative demonstrate that the method maintains type I error control, while existing methods for inference in adaptive settings do not cover in the misspecified case.</p></details> | 36 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Universal Banach--Bregman Framework for Stochastic Iterations: Unifying Stochastic Mirror Descent, Learning and LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14216v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic optimization powers the scalability of modern artificial intelligence, spanning machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language model training. Yet, existing theory remains largely confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, natural gradient descent in information geometry, or Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations, establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization. It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations ($\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks), deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning (actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>69 pa...</summary><p>69 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Unconditionally separating noisy $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ from bounded polynomial threshold circuits of constant depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16378v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of quantum devices fuels concerted efforts to experimentally establish quantum advantage over classical computing. Many demonstrations of quantum advantage, however, rely on computational assumptions and face verification challenges. Furthermore, steady advances in classical algorithms and machine learning make the issue of provable, practically demonstrable quantum advantage a moving target. In this work, we unconditionally demonstrate that parallel quantum computation can exhibit greater computational power than previously recognized. We prove that polynomial-size biased threshold circuits of constant depth -- which model neural networks with tunable expressivity -- fail to solve certain problems solvable by small constant-depth quantum circuits with local gates, for values of the bias that allow quantifiably large computational power. Additionally, we identify a family of problems that are solvable in constant depth by a universal quantum computer over prime-dimensional qudits with bounded connectivity, but remain hard for polynomial-size biased threshold circuits. We thereby bridge the foundational theory of non-local games in higher dimensions with computational advantage on emerging devices operating on a wide range of physical platforms. Finally, we show that these quantum advantages are robust to noise across all prime qudit dimensions with all-to-all connectivity, enhancing their practical appeal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Close...</summary><p>Close to published version</p></details> |
| **[Calibrating LLMs for Text-to-SQL Parsing by Leveraging Sub-clause Frequencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23804v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration, provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency" (SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection over traditional Platt scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Active Inference Framework for Closed-Loop Sensing, Communication, and Control in UAV Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14201v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a core technology for 6G, and its application to closed-loop sensing, communication, and control (SCC) enables various services. Existing SCC solutions often treat sensing and control separately, leading to suboptimal performance and resource usage. In this work, we introduce the active inference framework (AIF) into SCC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for joint state estimation, control, and sensing resource allocation. By formulating a unified generative model, the problem reduces to minimizing variational free energy for inference and expected free energy for action planning. Simulation results show that both control cost and sensing cost are reduced relative to baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Learning for Maze Navigation: Emergence of Mental Representations via Second-Order Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14195v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental representation, characterized by structured internal models mirroring external environments, is fundamental to advanced cognition but remains challenging to investigate empirically. Existing theory hypothesizes that second-order learning -- learning mechanisms that adapt first-order learning (i.e., learning about the task/domain) -- promotes the emergence of such environment-cognition isomorphism. In this paper, we empirically validate this hypothesis by proposing a hierarchical architecture comprising a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) as a first-order learner and an MLP controller as a second-order learner. The GCN directly maps node-level features to predictions of optimal navigation paths, while the MLP dynamically adapts the GCN's parameters when confronting structurally novel maze environments. We demonstrate that second-order learning is particularly effective when the cognitive system develops an internal mental map structurally isomorphic to the environment. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight significant performance improvements and robust generalization on unseen maze tasks, providing empirical support for the pivotal role of structured mental representations in maximizing the effectiveness of second-order learning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Text-to-Speech for Unseen Speakers via Low-Complexity Discrete Unit-Based Frame Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17432v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing the voices of unseen speakers remains a persisting challenge in multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS). Existing methods model speaker characteristics through speaker conditioning during training, leading to increased model complexity and limiting reproducibility and accessibility. A low-complexity alternative would broaden the reach of speech synthesis research, particularly in settings with limited computational and data resources. To this end, we propose SelectTTS, a simple and effective alternative. SelectTTS selects appropriate frames from the target speaker and decodes them using frame-level self-supervised learning (SSL) features. We demonstrate that this approach can effectively capture speaker characteristics for unseen speakers and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art multi-speaker TTS frameworks on both objective and subjective metrics. By directly selecting frames from the target speaker's speech, SelectTTS enables generalization to unseen speakers with significantly lower model complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems such as XTTS-v2 and VALL-E, while requiring over 8x fewer parameters and 270x less training data. Moreover, it demonstrates that frame selection with SSL features offers an efficient path to low-complexity, high-quality multi-speaker TTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for IEEE OJSP</p></details> |
| **[AI and the Future of Academic Peer Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14189v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Peer review remains the central quality-control mechanism of science, yet its ability to fulfill this role is increasingly strained. Empirical studies document serious shortcomings: long publication delays, escalating reviewer burden concentrated on a small minority of scholars, inconsistent quality and low inter-reviewer agreement, and systematic biases by gender, language, and institutional prestige. Decades of human-centered reforms have yielded only marginal improvements. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence, especially large language models (LLMs), is being piloted across the peer-review pipeline by journals, funders, and individual reviewers. Early studies suggest that AI assistance can produce reviews comparable in quality to humans, accelerate reviewer selection and feedback, and reduce certain biases, but also raise distinctive concerns about hallucination, confidentiality, gaming, novelty recognition, and loss of trust. In this paper, we map the aims and persistent failure modes of peer review to specific LLM applications and systematically analyze the objections they raise alongside safeguards that could make their use acceptable. Drawing on emerging evidence, we show that targeted, supervised LLM assistance can plausibly improve error detection, timeliness, and reviewer workload without displacing human judgment. We highlight advanced architectures, including fine-tuned, retrieval-augmented, and multi-agent systems, that may enable more reliable, auditable, and interdisciplinary review. We argue that ethical and practical considerations are not peripheral but constitutive: the legitimacy of AI-assisted peer review depends on governance choices as much as technical capacity. The path forward is neither uncritical adoption nor reflexive rejection, but carefully scoped pilots with explicit evaluation metrics, transparency, and accountability.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[Learning AC Power Flow Solutions using a Data-Dependent Variational Quantum Circuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03495v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interconnection studies require solving numerous instances of the AC load or power flow (AC PF) problem to simulate diverse scenarios as power systems navigate the ongoing energy transition. To expedite such studies, this work leverages recent advances in quantum computing to find or predict AC PF solutions using a variational quantum circuit (VQC). VQCs are trainable models that run on modern-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware to accomplish elaborate optimization and machine learning (ML) tasks. Our first contribution is to pose a single instance of the AC PF as a nonlinear least-squares fit over the VQC trainable parameters (weights) and solve it using a hybrid classical/quantum computing approach. The second contribution is to feed PF specifications as features into a data-embedded VQC and train the resultant quantum ML (QML) model to predict general PF solutions. The third contribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF quantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network. Preliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain enhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much fewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for addressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, accepted for the IEEE International Conference on Communications, Control, and Computing Technologies for Smart Grids 2025</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Sublinear Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05326v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-knowledge proofs allow verification of computations without revealing private information. However, existing systems require memory proportional to the computation size, which has historically limited use in large-scale applications and on mobile and edge devices. We solve this fundamental bottleneck by developing, to our knowledge, the first proof system with sublinear memory requirements for mainstream cryptographic constructions. Our approach processes computations in blocks using a space-efficient tree algorithm, reducing memory from linear scaling to square-root scaling--from $\Theta(T)$ to $O(\sqrt{T} + \log T \log\log T)$ for computation size $T$--while maintaining the same proof generation time through a constant number of streaming passes. For widely-used linear polynomial commitment schemes (KZG/IPA), our method produces identical proofs and verification when using the same parameters and hashing only aggregate commitments into the challenge generation, preserving proof size and security. Hash-based systems also achieve square-root memory scaling though with slightly different proof structures. This advance enables zero-knowledge proofs on everyday devices and makes previously infeasible large computations verifiable, fundamentally democratizing access to privacy-preserving computation. Space-efficient zero knowledge proof systems create opportunities to reshape how trust is established in digital systems--from enabling widespread participation in decentralized networks to making verifiable scientific computing practical at unprecedented scales.</p></details> | 23 pages |

We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems</p></details> |
| **[Catch Me if You Search: When Contextual Web Search Results Affect the Detection of Hallucinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01153v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or 'hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N=560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Computers in Human Behavior</p></details> |

Prior LLM work has focused on support systems for investors and financial planners. Simultaneously, numerous recent studies examine broader personal finance tasks, including budgeting, debt management, retirement, and estate planning, through agentic pipelines that incur high maintenance costs, yielding less than 25% of their expected financial returns. In this study, we introduce a novel and reproducible framework that integrates relevant financial context with behavioral finance studies to construct supervision data for end-to-end advisors. Using this framework, we create a 19k sample reasoning dataset and conduct a comprehensive fine-tuning of the Qwen-3-8B model on the dataset. Through a held-out test split and a blind LLM-jury study, we demonstrate that through careful data curation and behavioral integration, our 8B model achieves performance comparable to significantly larger baselines (14-32B parameters) across factual accuracy, fluency, and personalization metrics while incurring 80% lower costs than the larger counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Using LLMs in Generating Design Rationale for Software Architecture Decisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20781v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Design Rationale (DR) for software architecture decisions refers to the reasoning underlying architectural choices, which provides valuable insights into the different phases of the architecting process throughout software development. However, in practice, DR is often inadequately documented due to a lack of motivation and effort from developers. With the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their capabilities in text comprehension, reasoning, and generation may enable the generation and recovery of DR for architecture decisions. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in generating DR for architecture decisions. First, we collected 50 Stack Overflow (SO) posts, 25 GitHub issues, and 25 GitHub discussions related to architecture decisions to construct a dataset of 100 architecture-related problems. Then, we selected five LLMs to generate DR for the architecture decisions with three prompting strategies, including zero-shot, chain of thought (CoT), and LLM-based agents. With the DR provided by human experts as ground truth, the Precision of LLM-generated DR with the three prompting strategies ranges from 0.267 to 0.278, Recall from 0.627 to 0.715, and F1-score from 0.351 to 0.389. Additionally, 64.45% to 69.42% of the arguments of DR not mentioned by human experts are also helpful, 4.12% to 4.87% of the arguments have uncertain correctness, and 1.59% to 3.24% of the arguments are potentially misleading. To further understand the trustworthiness and applicability of LLM-generated DR in practice, we conducted semi-structured interviews with six practitioners. Based on the experimental and interview results, we discussed the pros and cons of the three prompting strategies, the strengths and limitations of LLM-generated DR, and the implications for the practical use of LLM-generated DR.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 5 images, 9 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Multimodal Attention for Manipulating Deformable Objects with Changing States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14837v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support humans in their daily lives, robots are required to autonomously learn, adapt to objects and environments, and perform the appropriate actions. We tackled on the task of cooking scrambled eggs using real ingredients, in which the robot needs to perceive the states of the egg and adjust stirring movement in real time, while the egg is heated and the state changes continuously. In previous works, handling changing objects was found to be challenging because sensory information includes dynamical, both important or noisy information, and the modality which should be focused on changes every time, making it difficult to realize both perception and motion generation in real time. We propose a predictive recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism that can weigh the sensor input, distinguishing how important and reliable each modality is, that realize quick and efficient perception and motion generation. The model is trained with learning from the demonstration, and allows the robot to acquire human-like skills. We validated the proposed technique using the robot, Dry-AIREC, and with our learning model, it could perform cooking eggs with unknown ingredients. The robot could change the method of stirring and direction depending on the status of the egg, as in the beginning it stirs in the whole pot, then subsequently, after the egg started being heated, it starts flipping and splitting motion targeting specific areas, although we did not explicitly indicate them.</p></details> | Humanoids2025 |
| **[Deconstructing Intraocular Pressure: A Non-invasive Multi-Stage Probabilistic Inverse Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14167v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many critical healthcare decisions are challenged by the inability to measure key underlying parameters. Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness driven by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), provides a stark example. The primary determinant of IOP, a tissue property called trabecular meshwork permeability, cannot be measured in vivo, forcing clinicians to depend on indirect surrogates. This clinical challenge is compounded by a broader computational one: developing predictive models for such ill-posed inverse problems is hindered by a lack of ground-truth data and prohibitive cost of large-scale, high-fidelity simulations. We address both challenges with an end-to-end framework to noninvasively estimate unmeasurable variables from sparse, routine data. Our approach combines a multi-stage artificial intelligence architecture to functionally separate the problem; a novel data generation strategy we term PCDS that obviates the need for hundreds of thousands of costly simulations, reducing the effective computational time from years to hours; and a Bayesian engine to quantify predictive uncertainty. Our framework deconstructs a single IOP measurement into its fundamental components from routine inputs only, yielding estimates for the unmeasurable tissue permeability and a patient's outflow facility. Our noninvasively estimated outflow facility achieved excellent agreement with state-of-the-art tonography with precision comparable to direct physical instruments. Furthermore, the newly derived permeability biomarker demonstrates high accuracy in stratifying clinical cohorts by disease risk, highlighting its diagnostic potential. More broadly, our framework establishes a generalizable blueprint for solving similar inverse problems in other data-scarce, computationally-intensive domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 10 figures (including supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Uni-cot: Towards Unified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across Text and Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05606v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

| **[Enabling Local Neural Operators to perform Equation-Free System-Level Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02308v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Operators (NOs) provide a powerful framework for computations involving physical laws that can be modelled by (integro-) partial differential equations (PDEs), directly learning maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces that bypass both the explicit equation identification and their subsequent numerical solving. Still, NOs have so far primarily been employed to explore the dynamical behavior as surrogates of brute-force temporal simulations/predictions. Their potential for systematic rigorous numerical system-level tasks, such as fixed-point, stability, and bifurcation analysis - crucial for predicting irreversible transitions in real-world phenomena - remains largely unexplored. Toward this aim, inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale framework, we propose and implement a framework that integrates (local) NOs with advanced iterative numerical methods in the Krylov subspace, so as to perform efficient system-level stability and bifurcation analysis of large-scale dynamical systems. Beyond fixed point, stability, and bifurcation analysis enabled by local in time NOs, we also demonstrate the usefulness of local in space as well as in space-time ("patch") NOs in accelerating the computer-aided analysis of spatiotemporal dynamics. We illustrate our framework via three nonlinear PDE benchmarks: the 1D Allen-Cahn equation, which undergoes multiple concatenated pitchfork bifurcations; the Liouville-Bratu-Gelfand PDE, which features a saddle-node tipping point; and the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model, consisting of two coupled PDEs that exhibit both Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations.</p></details> | 35 pages, 13 figures |

We propose to learn such behaviors from expert demonstrations via imitation learning (IL). However, when expert demonstrations are multi-modal, standard IL approaches can struggle to capture the diverse strategies, hindering effective coordination. Diffusion models are known to be effective at handling complex multi-modal trajectory distributions in single-agent systems. Diffusion models have also excelled in multi-agent scenarios where multi-modality is more common and crucial to learning coordinated behaviors. Typically, diffusion-based approaches require a centralized planner or explicit communication among agents, but this assumption can fail in real-world scenarios where robots must operate independently or with agents like humans that they cannot directly communicate with. Therefore, we propose MIMIC-D, a Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm for multi-modal multi-agent imitation learning using diffusion policies. Agents are trained jointly with full information, but execute policies using only local information to achieve implicit coordination. We demonstrate in both simulation and hardware experiments that our method recovers multi-modal coordination behavior among agents in a variety of tasks and environments, while improving upon state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model. Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

Recent studies have shown that abstract images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> |

However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We aim to bring together different approaches in multimodal machine learning and LLMs via a large benchmark. We hope it better allows researchers to follow the state-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, a growing number of testbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models. Thus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team released two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition tracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and industrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of 1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+ baselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available on the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page https://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of upcoming events will be continuously provided.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 MARS2 Workshop and Challenge "Multimodal Reasoning and Slow Thinking in the Large Model Era: Towards System 2 and Beyond''</p></details> |

Previous work on naturalistic scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences between stimuli. However, it is often desirable to assess representations of naturalistic images that vary along a continuum. Traditionally, perceptually continuous variations of naturalistic stimuli have been obtained by morphing a source image into a target image. This produces transitions driven mainly by low-level physical features and can result in semantically ambiguous outcomes. More recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate continuous perceptual variations within a stimulus category. Here we extend and generalize this approach using a different machine learning approach, a text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL), to generate a freely customizable stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions, with each image representing a unique exemplar within a prompted category. We demonstrate the approach by generating a set of 108 object scenes from 6 categories. For each object scene, we generate 10 variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. This ordering was first estimated using a machine learning model of perceptual similarity (LPIPS) and then subsequently validated with a large online sample of human participants. In a subsequent experiment we show that this ordering is also predictive of confusability of stimuli in a working memory experiment. Our image set is suited for studies investigating the graded encoding of naturalistic stimuli in visual perception, attention, and memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>80 pa...</summary><p>80 pages, 26 Figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as $\pi_0$ excel at continuous low-level control but lack an internal signal for identifying when a subtask has finished, making them brittle in sequential settings. We propose SeqVLA, a completion-aware extension of $\pi_0$ that augments the base architecture with a lightweight detection head perceiving whether the current subtask is complete. This dual-head design enables SeqVLA not only to generate manipulation actions but also to autonomously trigger transitions between subtasks. We investigate four finetuning strategies that vary in how the action and detection heads are optimized (joint vs. sequential finetuning) and how pretrained knowledge is preserved (full finetuning vs. frozen backbone). Experiments are performed on two multi-stage tasks: salad packing with seven distinct subtasks and candy packing with four distinct subtasks. Results show that SeqVLA significantly outperforms the baseline $\pi_0$ and other strong baselines in overall success rate. In particular, joint finetuning with an unfrozen backbone yields the most decisive and statistically reliable completion predictions, eliminating sequence-related failures and enabling robust long-horizon execution. Our results highlight the importance of coupling action generation with subtask-aware detection for scalable sequential manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This is a critical gap in high-stakes domains like medical education, where communication is a core competency. This paper introduces a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into immersive VR to create medically coherent virtual patients with distinct, consistent personalities, built on a modular architecture that decouples personality from clinical data. We evaluated our system in a mixed-method, within-subjects study with licensed physicians who engaged in simulated consultations. Results demonstrate that the approach is not only feasible but is also perceived by physicians as a highly rewarding and effective training enhancement. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers critical design principles, including a ``realism-verbosity paradox" where less communicative agents can seem more artificial, and the need for challenges to be perceived as authentic to be instructive. This work provides a validated framework and key insights for developing the next generation of socially intelligent VR training environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>14+4 ...</summary><p>14+4 pages, 6+6 figures</p></details> |

Yet, existing theory remains largely confined to Hilbert spaces, relying on inner-product frameworks and orthogonality. This paradigm fails to capture non-Euclidean settings, such as mirror descent on simplices, Bregman proximal methods for sparse learning, natural gradient descent in information geometry, or Kullback--Leibler-regularized language model training. Unlike Euclidean-based Hilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work introduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations, establishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization. It (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer monotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural gradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations ($\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and elucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems spanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and real-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks), deep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning (actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show up to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over classical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a cornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>69 pa...</summary><p>69 pages, 10 figures.

We extend the PoPStat framework, originally devised to link entire population pyramids with cause-specific mortality by applying it to COVID-19. Using 2019 United Nations World Population Prospects age-sex distributions together with cumulative cases and deaths per million recorded up to 5 May 2023 by Our World in Data, we calculate PoPDivergence (the Kullback-Leibler divergence from an optimised reference pyramid) for 180+ countries and derive PoPStat-COVID19 as the Pearson correlation between that divergence and log-transformed incidence or mortality. Optimisation selects Malta's old-skewed pyramid as the reference, yielding strong negative correlations for cases (r=-0.86, p<0.001, R^2=0.74) and deaths (r=-0.82, p<0.001, R^2=0.67). Sensitivity tests across twenty additional, similarly old-skewed references confirm that these associations are robust to reference choice. Benchmarking against eight standard indicators like gross domestic product per capita, Gini index, Human Development Index, life expectancy at birth, median age, population density, Socio-demographic Index, and Universal Health Coverage Index shows that PoPStat-COVID19 surpasses GDP per capita, median age, population density, and several other traditional measures, and outperforms every comparator for fatality burden. PoPStat-COVID19 therefore provides a concise, distribution-aware scalar for quantifying demographic vulnerability to COVID-19.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 Figures, 25th ICTer Conference</p></details> |

Unlike existing methods, KALL-E directly models the continuous speech distribution conditioned on text, eliminating the need for any diffusion-based components. Specifically, we utilize a Flow-VAE to extract a continuous latent speech representation from waveforms, instead of relying on discrete speech tokens. A single AR Transformer is then trained to predict these continuous speech distributions from text, optimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence loss as its objective. Experimental results demonstrate that KALL-E achieves superior speech synthesis quality and can even adapt to a target speaker from just a single sample. Importantly, KALL-E provides a more direct and effective approach for utilizing continuous speech representations in TTS.</p></details> | 6 figures, 5 tables |

However, cryptanalysis - a critical area for data security and its connection to LLMs' generalization abilities - remains underexplored in LLM evaluations. To address this gap, we evaluate the cryptanalytic potential of state-of-the-art LLMs on ciphertexts produced by a range of cryptographic algorithms. We introduce a benchmark dataset of diverse plaintexts, spanning multiple domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics, paired with their encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few-shot settings along with chain-of-thought prompting, we assess LLMs' decryption success rate and discuss their comprehension abilities. Our findings reveal key insights into LLMs' strengths and limitations in side-channel scenarios and raise concerns about their susceptibility to under-generalization-related attacks. This research highlights the dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing discussion on AI safety and security.</p></details> | EMNLP'25 Findings |
| **[On estimating the trace of quantum state powers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13559v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the computational complexity of estimating the trace of quantum state powers $\text{tr}(\rho^q)$ for an $n$-qubit mixed quantum state $\rho$, given its state-preparation circuit of size $\text{poly}(n)$. This quantity is closely related to and often interchangeable with the Tsallis entropy $\text{S}_q(\rho) = \frac{1-\text{tr}(\rho^q)}{q-1}$, where $q = 1$ corresponds to the von Neumann entropy. For any non-integer $q \geq 1 + \Omega(1)$, we provide a quantum estimator for $\text{S}_q(\rho)$ with time complexity $\text{poly}(n)$, exponentially improving the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (ISIT 2019), Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024), and Wang, Zhang, and Li (TIT 2024), and Wang and Zhang (ESA 2024). Our speedup is achieved by introducing efficiently computable uniform approximations of positive power functions into quantum singular value transformation. Our quantum algorithm reveals a sharp phase transition between the case of $q=1$ and constant $q>1$ in the computational complexity of the Quantum $q$-Tsallis Entropy Difference Problem (TsallisQED$_q$), particularly deciding whether the difference $\text{S}_q(\rho_0) - \text{S}_q(\rho_1)$ is at least $0.001$ or at most $-0.001$: - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq q \leq 2$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete, which implies that Purity Estimation is also $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. - For any $1 \leq q \leq 1 + \frac{1}{n-1}$, TsallisQED$_q$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-hard, leading to hardness of approximating the von Neumann entropy because $\text{S}_q(\rho) \leq \text{S}(\rho)$, as long as $\mathsf{BQP} \subsetneq \mathsf{QSZK}$. The hardness results are derived from reductions based on new inequalities for the quantum $q$-Jensen-(Shannon-)Tsallis divergence with $1\leq q \leq 2$, which are of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages, 3 tables, 3 algorithms. v3: Added a paragraph on recent developments, fixed the proof of Lemma 2.17 (Lemma 2.9 in the SODA proceedings), and made other minor changes. v2: Minor changes (particularly quantum query complexity lower bound for the hard regime, Theorem 5.8 in the SODA proceedings) and added references</p></details> |

As High-Performance Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse hardware. This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents" collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific and systems-oriented applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Adaptive Fourier Network (GAF-Net), a lightweight deep complex network that aims to establish a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The GAF-Net architecture consists of three components. First, a dual-feature encoder combining short-time Fourier transform and gammatone features enhances the robustness of acoustic representation. Second, a channel-independent globally adaptive Fourier modulator efficiently captures long-term temporal dependencies while preserving the spatial cues. Finally, a dynamic gating mechanism is implemented to reduce processing artifacts. Experimental results show that GAF-Net achieves competitive performance, particularly in terms of binaural cues (ILD and IPD error) and objective intelligibility (MBSTOI), with fewer parameters and computational cost. These results confirm that GAF-Net provides a feasible way to achieve high-fidelity binaural processing on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Even more critically, few studies systematically investigate the origins of bias. We propose a methodology grounded in comparative behavioral theory to interpret the complex interaction between training data and model architecture in bias propagation during language modeling. Building on recent work that relates transformers to n-gram LMs, we evaluate how data, model design choices, and temporal dynamics affect bias propagation. Our findings reveal that: (1) n-gram LMs are highly sensitive to context window size in bias propagation, while transformers demonstrate architectural robustness; (2) the temporal provenance of training data significantly affects bias; and (3) different model architectures respond differentially to controlled bias injection, with certain biases (e.g. sexual orientation) being disproportionately amplified. As language models become ubiquitous, our findings highlight the need for a holistic approach -- tracing bias to its origins across both data and model dimensions, not just symptoms, to mitigate harm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning-Driven Peptide Classification in Biological Nanopores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14029v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of ~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time disease diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages (incl. references) 7 figures</p></details> |

We first compress a strong AR$\leftrightarrow$EN teacher to FP8 (yielding $\sim$2$\times$ higher throughput with no quality loss) and use it to create high-fidelity bilingual supervision. A lightweight language model LFM2-1.2B is then fine-tuned on this data and used to translate high-quality English instruction sets into Arabic, producing a million-scale corpus tailored to instruction following. We train Hala models at 350M, 700M, 1.2B, and 9B parameters, and apply slerp merging to balance Arabic specialization with base-model strengths. On Arabic-centric benchmarks, Hala achieves state-of-the-art results within both the "nano" ($\leq$2B) and "small" (7-9B) categories, outperforming their bases.

| **[Efficient Tactile Perception with Soft Electrical Impedance Tomography and Pre-trained Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02824v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tactile sensing is fundamental to robotic systems, enabling interactions through physical contact in multiple tasks. Despite its importance, achieving high-resolution, large-area tactile sensing remains challenging. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) has emerged as a promising approach for large-area, distributed tactile sensing with minimal electrode requirements which can lend itself to addressing complex contact problems in robotics. However, existing EIT-based tactile reconstruction methods often suffer from high computational costs or depend on extensive annotated simulation datasets, hindering its viability in real-world settings. To address this shortcoming, here we propose a Pre-trained Transformer for EIT-based Tactile Reconstruction (PTET), a learning-based framework that bridges the simulation-to-reality gap by leveraging self-supervised pretraining on simulation data and fine-tuning with limited real-world data. In simulations, PTET requires 99.44 percent fewer annotated samples than equivalent state-of-the-art approaches (2,500 vs. 450,000 samples) while achieving reconstruction performance improvements of up to 43.57 percent under identical data conditions. Fine-tuning with real-world data further enables PTET to overcome discrepancies between simulated and experimental datasets, achieving superior reconstruction and detail recovery in practical scenarios. The improved reconstruction accuracy, data efficiency, and robustness in real-world tasks establish it as a scalable and practical solution for tactile sensing systems in robotics, especially for object handling and adaptive grasping under varying pressure conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics</p></details> |

However, the one-bit constraint poses significant challenges for precoding design, as it transforms the problem into a discrete and nonconvex optimization task. In this paper, we investigate a widely adopted ``convex-relaxation-then-quantization" approach for nonlinear symbol-level one-bit precoding. Specifically, we first solve a convex relaxation of the discrete minimum mean square error precoding problem, and then quantize the solution to satisfy the one-bit constraint. To analyze the high-dimensional asymptotic performance of this scheme, we develop a novel analytical framework based on approximate message passing (AMP). This framework enables us to derive a closed-form expression for the symbol error probability (SEP) at the receiver side in the large-system limit, which provides a quantitative characterization of how model and system parameters affect the SEP performance. Our empirical results suggest that the $\ell_\infty^2$ regularizer, when paired with an optimally chosen regularization parameter, achieves optimal SEP performance within a broad class of convex regularization functions. As a first step towards a theoretical justification, we prove the optimality of the $\ell_\infty^2$ regularizer within the mixed $\ell_\infty^2$-$\ell_2^2$ regularization functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the limited endurance and communication range of UAVs necessitate intelligent trajectory planning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been extensively explored for UAV trajectory optimization, its interactive nature entails high costs and risks in real-world environments. Offline RL mitigates these issues but remains susceptible to unstable training and heavily rely on expert-quality datasets. To address these challenges, we formulate a joint UAV trajectory planning and resource allocation problem to maximize energy efficiency of data collection. The resource allocation subproblem is first transformed into an equivalent linear programming formulation and solved optimally with polynomial-time complexity. Then, we propose a large language model (LLM)-empowered critic-regularized decision transformer (DT) framework, termed LLM-CRDT, to learn effective UAV control policies. In LLM-CRDT, we incorporate critic networks to regularize the DT model training, thereby integrating the sequence modeling capabilities of DT with critic-based value guidance to enable learning effective policies from suboptimal datasets. Furthermore, to mitigate the data-hungry nature of transformer models, we employ a pre-trained LLM as the transformer backbone of the DT model and adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, i.e., LoRA, enabling rapid adaptation to UAV control tasks with small-scale dataset and low computational overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM-CRDT outperforms benchmark online and offline RL methods, achieving up to 36.7\% higher energy efficiency than the current state-of-the-art DT approaches.</p></details> | 14pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achieving Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |

Recent work has identified in autoregressive transformer models a class of neurons -- called entropy neurons -- that produce a significant effect on the model output entropy while having an overall moderate impact on the ranking of the predicted tokens. In this paper, we investigate the preliminary claim that these neurons are involved in inhibiting context copying behavior in transformers by looking at their role in resolving conflicts between contextual and parametric information. We show that entropy neurons are responsible for suppressing context copying across a range of LLMs, and that ablating them leads to a significant change in the generation process. These results enhance our understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs when handling conflicting information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

To extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features. To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM), which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

To address these challenges, we propose Auto-Slides, an LLM-driven system that converts research papers into pedagogically structured, multimodal slides (e.g., diagrams and tables). Drawing on cognitive science, it creates a presentation-oriented narrative and allows iterative refinement via an interactive editor, in order to match learners' knowledge level and goals. Auto-Slides further incorporates verification and knowledge retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and contextual completeness. Through extensive user studies, Auto-Slides enhances learners' comprehension and engagement compared to conventional LLM-based reading.

We provided to our classes (1) a LLM-powered chatbot that had access to course materials by RAG and (2) AI-generated audio-only podcasts for each week$\text{'}$s teaching material. At the end of the semester, we surveyed the classes to gauge attitudes towards these tools. The classes were small and from biological courses. The students felt positive about AI generally and that AI tools made a positive impact on teaching. Students found the LLM-powered chatbot easy and enjoyable to use and felt that it enhanced their learning. The podcasts were less popular and only a small proportion of the class listened weekly. The class as a whole was indifferent to whether the podcasts should be used more widely across courses, but those who listened enjoyed them and were in favour.</p></details> | 6 Pages, 1 Figure |

Existing studies remain fragmented, and there is a lack of comprehensive guidance on how GNNs can be systematically applied to NG-IoT systems. As NG-IoT systems evolve toward 6G, they incorporate diverse technologies. These advances promise unprecedented connectivity, sensing, and automation but also introduce significant complexity, requiring new approaches for scalable learning, dynamic optimization, and secure, decentralized decision-making. This survey provides a comprehensive and forward-looking exploration of how GNNs can empower NG-IoT environments. We commence by exploring the fundamental paradigms of GNNs and articulating the motivation for their use in NG-IoT networks. Besides, we intrinsically connect GNNs with the family of low-density parity-check codes, modeling the NG-IoT as dynamic constrained graphs. We highlight the distinct roles of node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks in tackling key challenges and demonstrate the GNNs' ability to overcome the limitations of traditional optimization. We examine the application of GNNs across core NG-enabling technologies and their integration with distributed frameworks to support privacy-preservation and distributed intelligence. We then delve into the challenges posed by adversarial attacks, offering insights into defense mechanisms. Lastly, we examine how GNNs can be integrated with emerging technologies. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of GNNs in improving efficiency, scalability, and security. Finally, we summarize the key lessons learned and outline promising future research directions, along with a set of design guidelines tailored for NG-IoT applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 18 figures, and 6 tables.

Evaluating Prompt-Based Large Language Models (LLM)s for Software Requirements Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13868v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements classification assigns natural language requirements to predefined classes, such as functional and non functional. Accurate classification reduces risk and improves software quality. Most existing models rely on supervised learning, which needs large labeled data that are costly, slow to create, and domain dependent; they also generalize poorly and often require retraining for each task. This study tests whether prompt based large language models can reduce data needs. We benchmark several models and prompting styles (zero shot, few shot, persona, and chain of thought) across multiple tasks on two English datasets, PROMISE and SecReq. For each task we compare model prompt configurations and then compare the best LLM setups with a strong fine tuned transformer baseline. Results show that prompt based LLMs, especially with few shot prompts, can match or exceed the baseline. Adding a persona, or persona plus chain of thought, can yield further gains. We conclude that prompt based LLMs are a practical and scalable option that reduces dependence on large annotations and can improve generalizability across tasks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 12 figures |

Conventional approaches typically determine success or failure after the action has been carried out.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a model, which predicts the alignment between a pre-manipulation egocentric image with the planned trajectory and a given natural language instruction. We introduce a Multi-Level Trajectory Fusion module, which employs a state-of-the-art deep state-space model and a transformer encoder in parallel to capture multi-level time-series self-correlation within the end effector trajectory.

The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NON A...</summary><p>NON ARCHIVAL PRESENTATION 1st workshop on Dataset Distillation CVPR 2024</p></details> |

Unlike most existing speech separation methods, the APSS distinguishes itself by explicitly estimating the phase spectrum for more complete and accurate separation. Specifically, APSS first extracts the amplitude and phase spectra from the mixed speech signal. Subsequently, the extracted amplitude and phase spectra are fused by a feature combiner into joint representations, which are then further processed by a deep processor with time-frequency Transformers to capture temporal and spectral dependencies. Finally, leveraging parallel amplitude and phase separators, the APSS estimates the respective spectra for each speaker from the resulting features, which are then combined via inverse short-time Fourier transform (iSTFT) to reconstruct the separated speech signals. Experimental results indicate that APSS surpasses both time-domain separation methods and implicit-phase-estimation-based time-frequency approaches. Also, APSS achieves stable and competitive results on multiple datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability and practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by APSIPA2025</p></details> |

These cards employ sensitive automatic gain control and separate RF chains, introducing complex and dynamic distortions that render existing compensation methods ineffective. In this paper, we introduce Domino, a new framework that transforms channel state information (CSI) into channel impulse response (CIR) and leverages it for precise distortion compensation. Domino is built on the key insight that hardware-induced distortions impact all signal paths uniformly, allowing the dominant static path to serve as a reliable reference for effective compensation through delay-domain processing. Real-world respiration monitoring experiments show that Domino achieves at least 2x higher mean accuracy over existing methods, maintaining robust performance with a median error below 0.24 bpm, even using a single antenna in both direct line-of-sight and obstructed scenarios.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

This abundance of unnecessary image details creates numerous visual tokens, drastically increasing memory and computational requirements in VLMs. To address this, we propose Contextual Region-Oriented Visual Token Pruning (CROP), a novel framework to compress visual tokens through a two-step process: Localization and Pruning. Specifically, CROP first employs an efficient model to identify the contextual region relevant to the input query. Subsequently, two distinct strategies are introduced for pruning: (1) Pre-LLM Compression (PLC), which adaptively compresses different image regions with varying ratios, and (2) Inner-LLM Pruning (ILP), a training-free method that prunes tokens within early LLM layers guided by the identified contextual region. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VQA tasks demonstrate that CROP significantly outperforms existing visual token pruning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Main |

In recent research, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising method, but their intrinsic design, tailored primarily for sequential token processing, introduces notable challenges in effectively capturing spatial dependencies. Specifically, the inherent limitations of LLMs in modeling spatial relationships and their architectural incompatibility with graph-structured spatial data remain largely unaddressed. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ST-LINK, a novel framework that enhances the capability of Large Language Models to capture spatio-temporal dependencies. Its key components are Spatially-Enhanced Attention (SE-Attention) and the Memory Retrieval Feed-Forward Network (MRFFN). SE-Attention extends rotary position embeddings to integrate spatial correlations as direct rotational transformations within the attention mechanism. This approach maximizes spatial learning while preserving the LLM's inherent sequential processing structure. Meanwhile, MRFFN dynamically retrieves and utilizes key historical patterns to capture complex temporal dependencies and improve the stability of long-term forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-LINK surpasses conventional deep learning and LLM approaches, and effectively captures both regular traffic patterns and abrupt changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to CIKM 2025.

However, existing GNNs and graph Transformers tailored for directed graphs face two major challenges: (1) effectively capturing long-range causal dependencies derived from directed edges; (2) balancing accuracy and training efficiency when processing large-scale graph datasets. In recent years, state space models (SSMs) have achieved substantial progress in causal sequence tasks, and their variants designed for graphs have demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining high efficiency across various graph learning benchmarks. However, existing graph state space models are exclusively designed for undirected graphs, which limits their performance in directed graph learning. To this end, we propose an innovative approach DirEgo2Token which sequentializes directed graphs via k-hop ego graphs. This marks the first systematic extension of state space models to the field of directed graph learning. Building upon this, we develop DirGraphSSM, a novel directed graph neural network architecture that implements state space models on directed graphs via the message-passing mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that DirGraphSSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three representative directed graph learning tasks while attaining competitive performance on two additional tasks with 1.5$\times $ to 2$\times $ training speed improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>curre...</summary><p>currently undergoing review by IEEE Transactions on Big Data</p></details> |

As this new wave of AI permeates various sectors of society, we are continually uncovering both the potential and the limitations of existing AI tools. The need for adjustment is particularly significant in Computer Science Education (CSEd), as LLMs have evolved into core coding tools themselves, blurring the line between programming aids and intelligent systems, and reinforcing CSEd's role as a nexus of technology and pedagogy. The findings of our survey indicate that while AI technologies hold potential for enhancing learning experiences, such as through personalized learning paths, intelligent tutoring systems, and automated assessments, there are also emerging concerns. These include the risk of over-reliance on technology, the potential erosion of fundamental cognitive skills, and the challenge of maintaining equitable access to such innovations. Recent advancements represent a paradigm shift, transforming not only the content we teach but also the methods by which teaching and learning take place. Rather than placing the burden of adapting to AI technologies on students, educational institutions must take a proactive role in verifying, integrating, and applying new pedagogical approaches. Such efforts can help ensure that both educators and learners are equipped with the skills needed to navigate the evolving educational landscape shaped by these technological innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables, preprint (not approved for publication yet)</p></details> |

Building on the concept of (weak) Fr\'echet conditional means, we develop an additive regression model that represents the metric-based discrepancy of the response as a sum of covariate-specific nonlinear functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). To address the absence of linear structure in the response space, we transform the response via squared distances, enabling an interpretable and tractable additive decomposition. Variable selection is performed using Elastic Net regularization, extended to the RKHS setting, and further refined through a local linear approximation scheme that incorporates folded concave penalties such as the SCAD. We establish theoretical guarantees, including variable selection consistency and the strong oracle property, under minimal assumptions tailored to metric-space-valued responses. Simulations and applications to distributional and matrix-valued data demonstrate the scalability, interpretability, and practical effectiveness of the proposed approach. This work provides a principled foundation for statistical learning with random object data.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[PlaneRecTR++: Unified Query Learning for Joint 3D Planar Reconstruction and Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13756v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenging task of 3D planar reconstruction from images involves several sub-tasks including frame-wise plane detection, segmentation, parameter regression and possibly depth prediction, along with cross-frame plane correspondence and relative camera pose estimation. Previous works adopt a divide and conquer strategy, addressing above sub-tasks with distinct network modules in a two-stage paradigm. Specifically, given an initial camera pose and per-frame plane predictions from the first stage, further exclusively designed modules relying on external plane correspondence labeling are applied to merge multi-view plane entities and produce refined camera pose. Notably, existing work fails to integrate these closely related sub-tasks into a unified framework, and instead addresses them separately and sequentially, which we identify as a primary source of performance limitations. Motivated by this finding and the success of query-based learning in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we propose PlaneRecTR++, a Transformer-based architecture, which for the first time unifies all tasks of multi-view planar reconstruction and pose estimation within a compact single-stage framework, eliminating the need for the initial pose estimation and supervision of plane correspondence. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across sub-tasks, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the public ScanNetv1, ScanNetv2, NYUv2-Plane, and MatterPort3D datasets.

| **[Heuristics for the Run-length Encoded Burrows-Wheeler Transform Alphabet Ordering Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16435v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a string transformation technique widely used in areas such as bioinformatics and file compression. Many applications combine a run-length encoding (RLE) with the BWT in a way which preserves the ability to query the compressed data efficiently. However, these methods may not take full advantage of the compressibility of the BWT as they do not modify the alphabet ordering for the sorting step embedded in computing the BWT. Indeed, any such alteration of the alphabet ordering can have a considerable impact on the output of the BWT, in particular on the number of runs. For an alphabet $\Sigma$ containing $\sigma$ characters, the space of all alphabet orderings is of size $\sigma!$. While for small alphabets an exhaustive investigation is possible, finding the optimal ordering for larger alphabets is not feasible. Therefore, there is a need for a more informed search strategy than brute-force sampling the entire space, which motivates a new heuristic approach. In this paper, we explore the non-trivial cases for the problem of minimizing the size of a run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) via selecting a new ordering for the alphabet. We show that random sampling of the space of alphabet orderings usually gives sub-optimal orderings for compression and that a local search strategy can provide a large improvement in relatively few steps. We also inspect a selection of initial alphabet orderings, including ASCII, letter appearance, and letter frequency. While this alphabet ordering problem is computationally hard we demonstrate gain in compressibility.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCV 2025.

We propose turning exploration into supervision through Compute as Teacher (CaT), which converts the model's own exploration at inference-time into reference-free supervision by synthesizing a single reference from a group of parallel rollouts and then optimizing toward it. Concretely, the current policy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy) reconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra inference-time compute into a teacher signal. We turn this into rewards in two regimes: (i) verifiable tasks use programmatic equivalence on final answers; (ii) non-verifiable tasks use self-proposed rubrics-binary, auditable criteria scored by an independent LLM judge, with reward given by the fraction satisfied. Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge scores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all rollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a test-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up to +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench). With reinforcement learning (CaT-RL), we obtain further gains (up to +33% and +30%), with the trained policy surpassing the initial teacher signal.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Defending Diffusion Models Against Membership Inference Attacks via Higher-Order Langevin Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14225v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence applications have raised new data security concerns. This paper focuses on defending diffusion models against membership inference attacks. This type of attack occurs when the attacker can determine if a certain data point was used to train the model. Although diffusion models are intrinsically more resistant to membership inference attacks than other generative models, they are still susceptible. The defense proposed here utilizes critically-damped higher-order Langevin dynamics, which introduces several auxiliary variables and a joint diffusion process along these variables. The idea is that the presence of auxiliary variables mixes external randomness that helps to corrupt sensitive input data earlier on in the diffusion process. This concept is theoretically investigated and validated on a toy dataset and a speech dataset using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curves and the FID metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Off-Policy Inference for M-Estimators Under Model Misspecification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14218v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When data are collected adaptively, such as in bandit algorithms, classical statistical approaches such as ordinary least squares and $M$-estimation will often fail to achieve asymptotic normality. Although recent lines of work have modified the classical approaches to ensure valid inference on adaptively collected data, most of these works assume that the model is correctly specified. We propose a method that provides valid inference for M-estimators that use adaptively collected bandit data with a (possibly) misspecified working model. A key ingredient in our approach is the use of flexible machine learning approaches to stabilize the variance induced by adaptive data collection. A major novelty is that our procedure enables the construction of valid confidence sets even in settings where treatment policies are unstable and non-converging, such as when there is no unique optimal arm and standard bandit algorithms are used. Empirical results on semi-synthetic datasets constructed from the Osteoarthritis Initiative demonstrate that the method maintains type I error control, while existing methods for inference in adaptive settings do not cover in the misspecified case.</p></details> | 36 pages, 6 figures |

Existing SCC solutions often treat sensing and control separately, leading to suboptimal performance and resource usage. In this work, we introduce the active inference framework (AIF) into SCC-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems for joint state estimation, control, and sensing resource allocation. By formulating a unified generative model, the problem reduces to minimizing variational free energy for inference and expected free energy for action planning. Simulation results show that both control cost and sensing cost are reduced relative to baselines.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

Built with a FastConformer encoder and Transformer decoder, it supports 25 languages primarily European. The model was trained on 1.7M hours of total data samples, including Granary and NeMo ASR Set 3.0, with non-speech audio added to reduce hallucinations for ASR and AST. We describe its two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning process with dynamic data balancing, as well as experiments with an nGPT encoder. Results show nGPT scales well with massive data, while FastConformer excels after fine-tuning. For timestamps, Canary-1B-v2 uses the NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) with an auxiliary CTC model, providing reliable segment-level timestamps for ASR and AST. Evaluations show Canary-1B-v2 outperforms Whisper-large-v3 on English ASR while being 10x faster, and delivers competitive multilingual ASR and AST performance against larger models like Seamless-M4T-v2-large and LLM-based systems. We also release Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3, a successor to v2, offering multilingual ASR across the same 25 languages with just 600M parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mini ...</summary><p>Mini Version of it Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, these simulations often require large amounts of resources, necessitating the use of large clusters with thousands of compute nodes and large memory footprints. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end framework that provides an efficient partitioning scheme for large-scale QCs alongside a flexible code generator to offer a portable solution that minimizes data movement between compute nodes. By formulating the distribution of quantum states and circuits as a graph problem, we apply closeness centrality to assess gate importance and design a fast, scalable partitioning method. The resulting partitions are compiled into highly optimized codes that run seamlessly on a wide range of supercomputers, providing critical insights into the performance and scalability of quantum algorithm simulations.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

We focus on universal PPs featuring sampling from arbitrary measures and conditioning/reweighting in unbounded loops. We first equip Probabilistic Program Graphs (PPGs), an automata-theoretic description format of PPs, with an expectation-based semantics over infinite execution traces, which also incorporates trace weights. We then prove a finite approximation theorem that provides bounds to this semantics based on expectations taken over finite, fixed-length traces. This enables us to frame our semantics within a Feynman-Kac (FK) model, and ensures the consistency of the Particle Filtering (PF) algorithm, an instance of SMC, with respect to our semantics. Building on these results, we introduce VPF, a vectorized version of the PF algorithm tailored to PPGs and our semantics. Experiments conducted with a proof-of-concept implementation of VPF show very promising results compared to state-of-the-art PP inference tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GandALF 2025, arXiv:2509.13258</p></details> |

They group the pixels of an image into homogeneous regions while trying to respect existing contours. For all state-of-the-art superpixel decomposition methods, a trade-off is made between 1) computational time, 2) adherence to image contours and 3) regularity and compactness of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a fast method to compute Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP) in an iterative clustering framework. The distance computed when trying to associate a pixel to a superpixel during the clustering is enhanced by considering the linear path to the superpixel barycenter. The proposed framework produces regular and compact superpixels that adhere to the image contours. We provide a detailed evaluation of SCALP on the standard Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. The obtained results outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard superpixel and contour detection metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2016</p></details> |

We show that the set of networks that are consistent with the measurements are related through the nullspace of the observability matrix for the true network. In doing so, we illustrate how potentially many networks are fully consistent with the measurements despite having topologies that are structurally inconsistent with each other, an often neglected consideration in the design of topology inference methods. We then provide an aggregate characterization of the space of possible networks by analytically solving for the most structurally dissimilar network. We find that when observing over 6% of nodes in random network models (e.g., Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and Watts-Strogatz) the rate of edge misclassification drops to ~1%. Extending this discussion, we construct a family of networks that keep measurements $\epsilon$-"close" to each other, and connect the identifiability of these networks to the spectral properties of an augmented observability Gramian.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, in submission</p></details> |

However, deploying these models on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi poses challenges related to computational efficiency and thermal management. In this paper, a comprehensive evaluation of multiple convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for audio tagging on the Raspberry Pi is conducted, encompassing all 1D and 2D models from the Pretrained Audio Neural Networks (PANNs) framework, a ConvNeXt-based model adapted for audio classification, as well as MobileNetV3 architectures. In addition, two PANNs-derived networks, CNN9 and CNN13, recently proposed, are also evaluated. To enhance deployment efficiency and portability across diverse hardware platforms, all models are converted to the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. Unlike previous works that focus on a single model, our analysis encompasses a broader range of architectures and involves continuous 24-hour inference sessions to assess performance stability. Our experiments reveal that, with appropriate model selection and optimization, it is possible to maintain consistent inference latency and manage thermal behavior effectively over extended periods. These findings provide valuable insights for deploying audio tagging models in real-world edge computing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Computing Conference 2026, London, UK</p></details> |

A notable TTS technique is Self-Consistency (SC), which generates multiple reasoning chains in parallel and selects the final answer via majority voting. While effective, the order-of-magnitude computational overhead limits its broad deployment. Prior attempts to accelerate SC mainly rely on model-based confidence scores or heuristics with limited empirical support. For the first time, we theoretically and empirically analyze the inefficiencies of SC and reveal actionable opportunities for improvement. Building on these insights, we propose Slim-SC, a step-wise pruning strategy that identifies and removes redundant chains using inter-chain similarity at the thought level. Experiments on three STEM reasoning datasets and two recent LLM architectures show that Slim-SC reduces inference latency and KVC usage by up to 45% and 26%, respectively, with R1-Distill, while maintaining or improving accuracy, thus offering a simple yet efficient TTS alternative for SC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 (Oral), 9 pages</p></details> |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main text, 11 pages appendix, accepted at the 9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing studies focus on considering the sequential order of items and neglect to handle the temporal dynamics across items, which can imply evolving user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model, Generative Recommender Using Time awareness (GRUT), effectively capturing hidden user preferences via various temporal signals. We first introduce Time-aware Prompting, consisting of two key contexts. The user-level temporal context models personalized temporal patterns across timestamps and time intervals, while the item-level transition context provides transition patterns across users. We also devise Trend-aware Inference, a training-free method that enhances rankings by incorporating trend information about items with generation likelihood. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRUT outperforms state-of-the-art models, with gains of up to 15.4% and 14.3% in Recall@5 and NDCG@5 across four benchmark datasets.

In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |

Event cameras provide $\mu$s-level temporal resolution at mW-level power by asynchronously sensing brightness changes. In this work, we present EvHand-FPV, a lightweight framework for egocentric First-Person-View 3D hand tracking from a single event camera. We construct an event-based FPV dataset that couples synthetic training data with 3D labels and real event data with 2D labels for evaluation to address the scarcity of egocentric benchmarks. EvHand-FPV also introduces a wrist-based region of interest (ROI) that localizes the hand region via geometric cues, combined with an end-to-end mapping strategy that embeds ROI offsets into the network to reduce computation without explicit reconstruction, and a multi-task learning strategy with an auxiliary geometric feature head that improves representations without test-time overhead. On our real FPV test set, EvHand-FPV improves 2D-AUCp from 0.77 to 0.85 while reducing parameters from 11.2M to 1.2M by 89% and FLOPs per inference from 1.648G to 0.185G by 89%. It also maintains a competitive 3D-AUCp of 0.84 on synthetic data. These results demonstrate accurate and efficient egocentric event-based hand tracking suitable for on-device XR applications.

Beyond whole-body coordination and balance, a central difficulty lies in understanding human instructions and translating them into coherent sequences of embodied actions. Recent advances in foundation models provide transferable multimodal representations and reasoning capabilities, yet existing efforts remain largely restricted to either locomotion or manipulation in isolation, with limited applicability to humanoid settings. In this paper, we propose Humanoid-COA, the first humanoid agent framework that integrates foundation model reasoning with an Embodied Chain-of-Action (CoA) mechanism for zero-shot loco-manipulation. Within the perception--reasoning--action paradigm, our key contribution lies in the reasoning stage, where the proposed CoA mechanism decomposes high-level human instructions into structured sequences of locomotion and manipulation primitives through affordance analysis, spatial inference, and whole-body action reasoning. Extensive experiments on two humanoid robots, Unitree H1-2 and G1, in both an open test area and an apartment environment, demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms prior baselines across manipulation, locomotion, and loco-manipulation tasks, achieving robust generalization to long-horizon and unstructured scenarios.

Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

This paper systematically investigate the comparative dynamics of inductive (System 1) versus abductive/deductive (System 2) inference in LLMs. We utilize a controlled analogical reasoning environment, varying modality (textual, visual, symbolic), difficulty, and task format (MCQ / free-text). Our analysis reveals System 2 pipelines generally excel, particularly in visual/symbolic modalities and harder tasks, while System 1 is competitive for textual and easier problems. Crucially, task format significantly influences their relative advantage, with System 1 sometimes outperforming System 2 in free-text rule-execution. These core findings generalize to broader in-context learning.

| **[An Improved Template for Approximate Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06162v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks - i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area. We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures; author format corrected in metadata</p></details> |

Existing methods often convert event streams into intermediate representations such as frames, voxel grids, or point clouds, which inevitably require predefined time windows and thus introduce window latency. Meanwhile, pointwise detection methods face computational challenges that prevent real-time efficiency due to their high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate representations. Our method introduces a lightweight causal spatial neighborhood encoder to efficiently capture local geometric relations, followed by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear complexity. During inference, a controller adaptively adjusts the processing speed according to the event rate, achieving an optimal balance between window latency and inference latency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

In particular, we investigate various soft-prompting strategies, including prefix-tuning, prompt-tuning, P-tuning, and P-tuning V2, as well as LoRA reparameterizations. For the data-efficient strategy, we analyze hard prompting with zero-shot and few-shot inferences to analyze the dialect identification capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). For the parameter-efficient PEFT approaches, we conducted our experiments using Arabic-specific encoder models on several major datasets. We also analyzed the n-shot inferences on open-source decoder-only models, a general multilingual model (Phi-3.5), and an Arabic-specific one(SILMA). We observed that the LLMs generally struggle to differentiate the dialectal nuances in the few-shot or zero-shot setups. The soft-prompted encoder variants perform better, while the LoRA-based fine-tuned models perform best, even surpassing full fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 mai...</summary><p>4 main pages, 4 additional, 5 figures</p></details> |

To simplify access to predefined AI services, this paper introduces MIRA, a pioneering framework for task instruction recommendation that enables intuitive one-touch AI tasking on smartphones. With MIRA, users can long-press on images or text objects to receive contextually relevant instruction recommendations for executing AI tasks. Our work introduces three key innovations: 1) A multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based recommendation pipeline with structured reasoning to extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions; 2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level reasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based constrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction candidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through evaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has demonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction recommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to revolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones, offering a more seamless and efficient experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 6: Industry Track), ACL 2025.

Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation, we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to ICASSP</p></details> |
| **[THOR: Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL for Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13761v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both trajectory-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JingMog/THOR.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Implementing a Logical Inference System for Japanese Comparatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13734v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) involving comparatives is challenging because it requires understanding quantities and comparative relations expressed by sentences. While some approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), we focus on logic-based approaches grounded in compositional semantics, which are promising for robust handling of numerical and logical expressions. Previous studies along these lines have proposed logical inference systems for English comparatives. However, it has been pointed out that there are several morphological and semantic differences between Japanese and English comparatives. These differences make it difficult to apply such systems directly to Japanese comparatives. To address this gap, this study proposes ccg-jcomp, a logical inference system for Japanese comparatives based on compositional semantics. We evaluate the proposed system on a Japanese NLI dataset containing comparative expressions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing its accuracy with that of existing LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Natural Logic Meets Machine Learning (NALOMA)</p></details> |
| **[FSR-VLN: Fast and Slow Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13733v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental challenge in robotic systems, with broad applications for the deployment of embodied agents in real-world environments. Despite recent advances, existing approaches are limited in long-range spatial reasoning, often exhibiting low success rates and high inference latency, particularly in long-range navigation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FSR-VLN, a vision-language navigation system that combines a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) with Fast-to-Slow Navigation Reasoning (FSR). The HMSG provides a multi-modal map representation supporting progressive retrieval, from coarse room-level localization to fine-grained goal view and object identification. Building on HMSG, FSR first performs fast matching to efficiently select candidate rooms, views, and objects, then applies VLM-driven refinement for final goal selection. We evaluated FSR-VLN across four comprehensive indoor datasets collected by humanoid robots, utilizing 87 instructions that encompass a diverse range of object categories. FSR-VLN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all datasets, measured by the retrieval success rate (RSR), while reducing the response time by 82% compared to VLM-based methods on tour videos by activating slow reasoning only when fast intuition fails. Furthermore, we integrate FSR-VLN with speech interaction, planning, and control modules on a Unitree-G1 humanoid robot, enabling natural language interaction and real-time navigation.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Causal Clustering for Conditional Average Treatment Effects Estimation and Subgroup Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05775v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is critical in domains such as personalized medicine, resource allocation, and policy evaluation. A central challenge lies in identifying subpopulations that respond differently to interventions, thereby enabling more targeted and effective decision-making. While clustering methods are well-studied in unsupervised learning, their integration with causal inference remains limited. We propose a novel framework that clusters individuals based on estimated treatment effects using a learned kernel derived from causal forests, revealing latent subgroup structures. Our approach consists of two main steps. First, we estimate debiased Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs) using orthogonalized learners via the Robinson decomposition, yielding a kernel matrix that encodes sample-level similarities in treatment responsiveness. Second, we apply kernelized clustering to this matrix to uncover distinct, treatment-sensitive subpopulations and compute cluster-level average CATEs. We present this kernelized clustering step as a form of regularization within the residual-on-residual regression framework. Through extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, supported by ablation studies and exploratory analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print for camera ready version for IEEE EMBS BHI 2025.

We identify three main prompting styles in financial NLP (FinNLP): (1) standard prompting (zero-shot), (2) unstructured CoT (free-form reasoning), and (3) structured CoT (with explicitly structured reasoning steps). Prior work has mainly focused on the first two, while structured CoT remains underexplored and lacks domain expertise incorporation. Therefore, we evaluate all three prompting approaches across ten CFA-style financial domains and introduce FinCoT as the first structured finance-specific prompting approach incorporating blueprints from domain experts. FinCoT improves the accuracy of a general-purpose model, Qwen3-8B-Base, from 63.2% to 80.5%, and boosts Fin-R1 (7B), a finance-specific model, from 65.7% to 75.7%, while reducing output length by up to 8.9x and 1.16x compared to structured CoT methods, respectively. We find that FinCoT proves most effective for models lacking financial post-training. Our findings show that FinCoT does not only improve performance and reduce inference costs but also yields more interpretable and expert-aligned reasoning traces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FinNLP-2025, EMNLP</p></details> |
| **[Can Large Language Models Robustly Perform Natural Language Inference for Japanese Comparatives?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13695v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) perform remarkably well in Natural Language Inference (NLI). However, NLI involving numerical and logical expressions remains challenging. Comparatives are a key linguistic phenomenon related to such inference, but the robustness of LLMs in handling them, especially in languages that are not dominant in the models' training data, such as Japanese, has not been sufficiently explored. To address this gap, we construct a Japanese NLI dataset that focuses on comparatives and evaluate various LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our results show that the performance of the models is sensitive to the prompt formats in the zero-shot setting and influenced by the gold labels in the few-shot examples. The LLMs also struggle to handle linguistic phenomena unique to Japanese. Furthermore, we observe that prompts containing logical semantic representations help the models predict the correct labels for inference problems that they struggle to solve even with few-shot examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[EdgeProfiler: A Fast Profiling Framework for Lightweight LLMs on Edge Using Analytical Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09061v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA, Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that 4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 fig...</summary><p>4 figures, 7 pages, IEEE conference template</p></details> |
| **[Design and Analysis of Switchback Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.00148v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Switchback experiments, where a firm sequentially exposes an experimental unit to random treatments, are among the most prevalent designs used in the technology sector, with applications ranging from ride-hailing platforms to online marketplaces. Although practitioners have widely adopted this technique, the derivation of the optimal design has been elusive, hindering practitioners from drawing valid causal conclusions with enough statistical power. We address this limitation by deriving the optimal design of switchback experiments under a range of different assumptions on the order of the carryover effect -- the length of time a treatment persists in impacting the outcome. We cast the optimal experimental design problem as a minimax discrete optimization problem, identify the worst-case adversarial strategy, establish structural results, and solve the reduced problem via a continuous relaxation. For switchback experiments conducted under the optimal design, we provide two approaches for performing inference. The first provides exact randomization based p-values, and the second uses a new finite population central limit theorem to conduct conservative hypothesis tests and build confidence intervals. We further provide theoretical results when the order of the carryover effect is misspecified and provide a data-driven procedure to identify the order of the carryover effect. We conduct extensive simulations to study the numerical performance and empirical properties of our results, and conclude with practical suggestions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed a typo in definition (3).

However, existing methods treat instruction conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues, without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid, fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

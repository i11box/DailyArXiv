| **[MagicQuillV2: Precise and Interactive Image Editing with Layered Visual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03046v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software. While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo available at https://magicquill.art/v2/</p></details> |
| **[CAMEO: Correspondence-Attention Alignment for Multi-View Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03045v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/CAMEO/</p></details> |
| **[OneThinker: All-in-one Reasoning Model for Image and Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03043v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/tulerfeng/OneThinker</p></details> |
| **[MultiShotMaster: A Controllable Multi-Shot Video Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03041v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://qinghew.github.io/MultiShotMaster</p></details> |
| **[Video4Spatial: Towards Visuospatial Intelligence with Context-Guided Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03040v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://xizaoqu.github.io/video4spatial/</p></details> |
| **[Amortized Sampling with Transferable Normalizing Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18175v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest towards overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing competitively with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We demonstrate that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 285 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve competitive performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Provable Scaling Laws of Feature Emergence from Learning Dynamics of Grokking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21519v5)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been studied extensively, it remains an open problem whether there is a mathematical framework that characterizes what kind of features will emerge, how and in which conditions it happens, and is closely related to the gradient dynamics of the training, for complex structured inputs. We propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li}_2$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning. At the lazy learning stage, top layer overfits to random hidden representation and the model appears to memorize, and at the same time, the backpropagated gradient $G_F$ from the top layer now carries information about the target label, with a specific structure that enables each hidden node to learn their representation independently. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. When hidden nodes start to interact in the later stage of learning, we provably show how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of feature emergence, memorization and generalization, and reveals why recent optimizers such as Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our analysis can be extended to multi-layers. The code is available at https://github.com/yuandong-tian/understanding/tree/main/ssl/real-dataset/cogo.</p></details> | <details><summary>Find ...</summary><p>Find new mechanism that $G_F$ carries useful signals also at initial stage and thus remove theory's dependency on weight decay.

| **[Learning Physically Consistent Lagrangian Control Models Without Acceleration Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03035v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article investigates the modeling and control of Lagrangian systems involving non-conservative forces using a hybrid method that does not require acceleration calculations. It focuses in particular on the derivation and identification of physically consistent models, which are essential for model-based control synthesis. Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the L4DC 2026</p></details> |
| **[MAViD: A Multimodal Framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03034v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our project website is https://carlyx.github.io/MAViD/</p></details> |
| **[Parallelizing MCMC Across the Sequence Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18413v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are foundational algorithms for Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling. However, most MCMC algorithms are inherently sequential and their time complexity scales linearly with the sequence length. Previous work on adapting MCMC to modern hardware has therefore focused on running many independent chains in parallel. Here, we take an alternative approach: we propose algorithms to evaluate MCMC samplers in parallel across the chain length. To do this, we build on recent methods for parallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence as a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a parallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to parallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the simulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of parallel Newton iterations. Additionally, we develop two new parallel quasi-Newton methods to evaluate nonlinear recursions with lower memory costs and reduced runtime. We find that the proposed parallel algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling across multiple examples, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude compared to sequential evaluation.</p></details> | 36 pages, 19 figures |
| **[SMP: Reusable Score-Matching Motion Priors for Physics-Based Character Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03028v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.

| **[TokenPowerBench: Benchmarking the Power Consumption of LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03024v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI'26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |

However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation strategies of tabular foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The library is open source and available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune</p></details> |
| **[AutoBrep: Autoregressive B-Rep Generation with Unified Topology and Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03018v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes. Code is available at https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/AutoBrep.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Siggraph Asia 2025</p></details> |
| **[Instant Video Models: Universal Adapters for Stabilizing Image-Based Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03014v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[In-Context Sync-LoRA for Portrait Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03013v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sagipolaczek.github.io/Sync-LoRA/</p></details> |
| **[From Moderation to Mediation: Can LLMs Serve as Mediators in Online Flame Wars?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03005v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Invasive Context Engineering to Control Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03001v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on operator control of Large Language Models improves model robustness against adversarial attacks and misbehavior by training on preference examples, prompting, and input/output filtering. Despite good results, LLMs remain susceptible to abuse, and jailbreak probability increases with context length. There is a need for robust LLM security guarantees in long-context situations. We propose control sentences inserted into the LLM context as invasive context engineering to partially solve the problem. We suggest this technique can be generalized to the Chain-of-Thought process to prevent scheming. Invasive Context Engineering does not rely on LLM training, avoiding data shortage pitfalls which arise in training models for long context situations.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Optimised Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12057v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annealed Sequential Monte Carlo (ASMC) samplers are special cases of SMC samplers where the sequence of distributions can be embedded in a smooth path of distributions. Using this underlying path and a performance model based on the variance of the normalising constant estimator, we systematically study dense-schedule limits. From our theory emerges a notion of global barrier, capturing the inherent complexity of normalising constant approximation under our performance model. We then turn the resulting approximations into surrogate objective functions of algorithm performance, using them to guide method development. This leads to novel adaptive methods, Optimised Annealed SMC (OASMC), which address practical difficulties inherent in previous adaptive SMC methods. First, our OASMC algorithms are predictable: they produce a sequence of increasingly precise estimates at deterministic, known times. Second, Optimised Annealed Importance Sampling (OAIS), a special case of OASMC, enables schedule adaptation at a memory cost constant in the number of particles, requiring significantly less communication. Finally, these characteristics make OAIS highly efficient on GPUs. We provide an open-source, high-performance GPU implementation of our method and demonstrate up to a hundred-fold speed improvement compared to state-of-the-art adaptive AIS methods.</p></details> | 88 pages, 14 figures |

To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.neural4d.com/research-page/textrix</p></details> |

Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT) framework, which leverages pretrained language models providing rich prior knowledge for RL tasks and fine-tunes the sequence model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for meta-RL problems. We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model provides the prior knowledge and achieves a similar performance with Prompt-DT under only $10\%$ data in some MuJoCo control tasks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each component, including sequence modeling, language models, prompt regularizations, and prompt strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 10 tables.

| **[PrITTI: Primitive-based Generation of Controllable and Editable 3D Semantic Urban Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19117v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing approaches to 3D semantic urban scene generation predominantly rely on voxel-based representations, which are bound by fixed resolution, challenging to edit, and memory-intensive in their dense form. In contrast, we advocate for a primitive-based paradigm where urban scenes are represented using compact, semantically meaningful 3D elements that are easy to manipulate and compose. To this end, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion model that leverages vectorized object primitives and rasterized ground surfaces for generating diverse, controllable, and editable 3D semantic urban scenes. This hybrid representation yields a structured latent space that facilitates object- and ground-level manipulation. Experiments on KITTI-360 show that primitive-based representations unlock the full capabilities of diffusion transformers, achieving state-of-the-art 3D scene generation quality with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and greater editability than voxel-based methods. Beyond generation, PrITTI supports a range of downstream applications, including scene editing, inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

| **[Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Logical Translation: Reducing Hallucinations with Lang2Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02987v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), particularly large language models (LLMs), have motivated the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal logic without human intervention. This enables automated reasoning and facilitates debugging, finding loop invariants, and adhering to specifications in software systems. However, hallucinations-incorrect outputs generated by LLMs are challenging, particularly for logical translation tasks requiring precision. This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model. Thus, it provides reliable CNF generation.</p></details> | IEEE ISNCC 2025 |

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 19 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[InEx: Hallucination Mitigation via Introspection and Cross-Modal Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02981v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[BEVDilation: LiDAR-Centric Multi-Modal Fusion for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02972v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion.

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+11 ...</summary><p>8+11 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |

Although current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, their accuracy and generalization are limited by the scarcity of failure data. To address this data gap, we propose an automatic robot failure synthesis approach that procedurally perturbs successful trajectories to generate diverse planning and execution failures. This method produces not only binary classification labels but also fine-grained failure categories and step-by-step reasoning traces in both simulation and the real world. With it, we construct three new failure detection benchmarks: RLBench-Fail, BridgeDataV2-Fail, and UR5-Fail, substantially expanding the diversity and scale of existing failure datasets. We then train Guardian, a VLM with multi-view images for detailed failure reasoning and detection. Guardian achieves state-of-the-art performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks. It also effectively improves task success rates when integrated into a state-of-the-art manipulation system in simulation and real robots, demonstrating the impact of our generated failure data.

An interplay between constraints, tinkering, and frequency-dependent selection drives the complex evolutionary trajectories of these socio-technological systems. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling and case studies, drawing on complex network analysis and evolutionary theory to explore how software evolves under the competing forces of novelty generation and imitation. By examining the evolution of programming languages and their impact on developer practices, we illustrate how technological artifacts co-evolve with and shape societal norms, cultural dynamics, and human interactions. This ecological perspective also informs our analysis of the emerging role of AI-driven development tools in software evolution. While large language models (LLMs) provide unprecedented access to information, their widespread adoption introduces new evolutionary pressures that may contribute to cultural stagnation, much like the decline of diversity in past software ecosystems. Understanding the evolutionary pressures introduced by AI-mediated software production is critical for anticipating broader patterns of cultural change, technological adaptation, and the future of software innovation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is a contributed chapter to the SFI edited volume: The Economy as a Complex Evolving System, Part IV (2025)</p></details> |

However, our pilot study reveals that models pretrained with shorter context windows consistently outperform their long-context counterparts under a fixed token budget. This finding motivates us to explore an optimal context window scheduling strategy to better balance long-context capability with pretraining efficiency. To this end, we propose SkyLadder, a simple yet effective approach that implements a short-to-long context window transition. SkyLadder preserves strong standard benchmark performance, while matching or exceeding baseline results on long context tasks. Through extensive experiments, we pre-train 1B-parameter models (up to 32K context) and 3B-parameter models (8K context) on 100B tokens, demonstrating that SkyLadder yields consistent gains of up to 3.7% on common benchmarks, while achieving up to 22% faster training speeds compared to baselines.

Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For associated code and datasets, see https://github.com/8bitsam/actiongraph-testbench</p></details> |

While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and demo available at https://magicquill.art/v2/</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.neural4d.com/research-page/textrix</p></details> |

Recent works have demonstrated that using parts of trajectories from training tasks as prompts in DT enhances its performance on unseen tasks, giving rise to Prompt-DT methods. However, collecting data from specific environments can be both costly and unsafe in many scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance and limited few-shot prompt abilities due to the data-hungry nature of Transformer-based models. Additionally, the limited datasets used in pre-training make it challenging for Prompt-DT type of methods to distinguish between various RL tasks through prompts alone. To address these challenges, we introduce the Language model-initialized Prompt Decision Transformer (LPDT) framework, which leverages pretrained language models providing rich prior knowledge for RL tasks and fine-tunes the sequence model using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for meta-RL problems. We further incorporate prompt regularization to effectively differentiate between tasks based on prompt feature representations. Comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate that initializing with a pre-trained language model provides the prior knowledge and achieves a similar performance with Prompt-DT under only $10\%$ data in some MuJoCo control tasks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to validate the effectiveness of each component, including sequence modeling, language models, prompt regularizations, and prompt strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 10 tables.

In contrast, we advocate for a primitive-based paradigm where urban scenes are represented using compact, semantically meaningful 3D elements that are easy to manipulate and compose. To this end, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion model that leverages vectorized object primitives and rasterized ground surfaces for generating diverse, controllable, and editable 3D semantic urban scenes. This hybrid representation yields a structured latent space that facilitates object- and ground-level manipulation. Experiments on KITTI-360 show that primitive-based representations unlock the full capabilities of diffusion transformers, achieving state-of-the-art 3D scene generation quality with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and greater editability than voxel-based methods. Beyond generation, PrITTI supports a range of downstream applications, including scene editing, inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization.</p></details> | 25 pages, 3 figures |

However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach, achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively, across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up, which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing, while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness.

| **[FAIRY2I: Universal Extremely-Low Bit QAT framework via Widely-Linear Representation and Phase-Aware Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02901v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[PERP: Rethinking the Prune-Retrain Paradigm in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15230v4)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Networks can be effectively compressed through pruning, significantly reducing storage and compute demands while maintaining predictive performance. Simple yet effective methods like magnitude pruning remove less important parameters and typically require a costly retraining procedure to restore performance. However, with the rise of LLMs, full retraining has become infeasible due to memory and compute constraints. This study challenges the practice of retraining all parameters by showing that updating a small subset of highly expressive parameters can suffice to recover or even enhance performance after pruning. Surprisingly, retraining just 0.01%-0.05% of the parameters in GPT-architectures can match the performance of full retraining across various sparsity levels, significantly reducing compute and memory requirements, and enabling retraining of models with up to 30 billion parameters on a single GPU in minutes. To bridge the gap to full retraining in the high sparsity regime, we introduce two novel LoRA variants that, unlike standard LoRA, allow merging adapters back without compromising sparsity. Going a step further, we show that these methods can be applied for memory-efficient layer-wise reconstruction, significantly enhancing state-of-the-art retraining-free methods like Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and SparseGPT (Frantar & Alistarh, 2023). Our findings present a promising alternative to avoiding retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 7 figures, 24 tables</p></details> |

While ReLU remains widely used due to its simplicity, it suffers from gradient sparsity and dead-neuron issues and offers no adaptivity to input statistics. Smooth alternatives such as Swish and GELU improve gradient propagation but still apply a fixed transformation regardless of the activation distribution. In this paper, we propose VeLU, a Variance-enhanced Learning Unit that introduces variance-aware and distributionally aligned nonlinearity through a principled combination of ArcTan-ArcSin transformations, adaptive scaling, and Wasserstein-2 regularization (Optimal Transport). This design enables VeLU to modulate its response based on local activation variance, mitigate internal covariate shift at the activation level, and improve training stability without adding learnable parameters or architectural overhead. Extensive experiments across six deep neural networks show that VeLU outperforms ReLU, ReLU6, Swish, and GELU on 12 vision benchmarks. The implementation of VeLU is publicly available in GitHub.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Accurate detection and delineation of these lesions on imaging are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical intervention. In this study, we introduce AbscessHeNe, a curated and comprehensively annotated dataset comprising 4,926 contrast-enhanced CT slices with clinically confirmed head and neck abscesses. The dataset is designed to facilitate the development of robust semantic segmentation models that can accurately delineate abscess boundaries and evaluate deep neck space involvement, thereby supporting informed clinical decision-making. To establish performance baselines, we evaluate several state-of-the-art segmentation architectures, including CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based models. The highest-performing model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.39, Intersection-over-Union of 0.27, and Normalized Surface Distance of 0.67, indicating the challenges of this task and the need for further research. Beyond segmentation, AbscessHeNe is structured for future applications in content-based multimedia indexing and case-based retrieval. Each CT scan is linked with pixel-level annotations and clinical metadata, providing a foundation for building intelligent retrieval systems and supporting knowledge-driven clinical workflows.

Available public datasets primarily focus on malignant lesions and often overlook other space-occupying conditions in this region. To address this gap, we introduce MasHeNe, an initial dataset of 3,779 contrast-enhanced CT slices that includes both tumors and cysts with pixel-level annotations. We also establish a benchmark using standard segmentation baselines and report common metrics to enable fair comparison. In addition, we propose the Windowing-Enhanced Mamba with Frequency integration (WEMF) model. WEMF applies tri-window enhancement to enrich the input appearance before feature extraction. It further uses multi-frequency attention to fuse information across skip connections within a U-shaped Mamba backbone. On MasHeNe, WEMF attains the best performance among evaluated methods, with a Dice of 70.45%, IoU of 66.89%, NSD of 72.33%, and HD95 of 5.12 mm. This model indicates stable and strong results on this challenging task. MasHeNe provides a benchmark for head-and-neck mass segmentation beyond malignancy-only datasets. The observed error patterns also suggest that this task remains challenging and requires further research.

Breath-hold MRCP was acquired from 11 healthy volunteers on 3T scanners using an incoherent k-space sampling pattern, leading to 14-second acquisition time and an acceleration factor of R=25. Zero-shot reconstruction was compared with parallel imaging of respiratory-triggered MRCP (338s, R=3) and compressed sensing reconstruction. For two volunteers, breath-hold scans (40s, R=6) were additionally acquired and retrospectively undersampled to R=25 to compute peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). To address long zero-shot training time, the n+m full stages of the zero-shot learning were divided into two parts to reduce backpropagation depth during training: 1) n frozen stages initialized with n-stage pretrained network and 2) m trainable stages initialized either randomly or m-stage pretrained network. Efficiency of our approach was assessed by varying initialization strategies and the number of trainable stages using the retrospectively undersampled data. Zero-shot reconstruction significantly improved visual image quality over compressed sensing, particularly in SNR and ductal delineation, and achieved image quality comparable to that of successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing patterns. Improved initializations enhanced PSNR and reduced reconstruction time. Adjusting frozen/trainable configurations demonstrated that PSNR decreased only slightly from 38.25 dB (0/13) to 37.67 dB (12/1), while training time decreased up to 6.7-fold. Zero-shot learning delivers high-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and the proposed partially trainable approach offers a practical solution for translation into time-constrained clinical workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 8 figures, 2 tabels</p></details> |

However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026 Conference</p></details> |

To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

All models tackle the same five class classification task using a common dataset of speech recordings. We investigate: (1) a ViT-OF method leveraging a Vision Transformer on spectrogram images, (2) a 1D-CNN approach using eight 1-D CNN's with majority-vote fusion, (3) a BiLSTM-OF approach using nine BiLSTM models with majority vote fusion, and (4) a Hierarchical XGBoost ensemble that combines glottal and formant features through a two stage learning framework. Each method is described, and their performances on a validation set of 53 speakers are compared. Results show that while the feature-engineered XGBoost ensemble achieves the highest macro-F1 (0.86), the deep learning models (ViT, CNN, BiLSTM) attain competitive F1-scores (0.70) and offer complementary insights into the problem.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training.

| **[EvoC2Rust: A Skeleton-guided Framework for Project-Level C-to-Rust Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04295v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating legacy C codebases to Rust is increasingly demanded for building safety-critical systems. While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based methods often struggle to satisfy code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based methods frequently fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting complete C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros, and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates functions, replacing the corresponding stub placeholders; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates the superior performance of EvoC2Rust in project-level C-to-Rust translation. The results show that our approach outperforms the strongest LLM-based baseline by 17.24% in syntax accuracy and 14.32% in semantic accuracy, while also achieving a 43.59% higher code safety rate than the best rule-based tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026 SEIP</p></details> |

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design. We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects. We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies. Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples. Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.</p></details> | PhD Dissertation |

The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB.

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Classical approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in full for each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has inspired interest towards overcoming this limitation through learning sampling algorithms. Despite performing competitively with conventional methods when trained on a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to transfer across systems. We demonstrate that deep learning enables the design of scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 285 million parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems, achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length, whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows. Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve competitive performance to established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo. We open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Parallelizing MCMC Across the Sequence Length](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18413v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are foundational algorithms for Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling. However, most MCMC algorithms are inherently sequential and their time complexity scales linearly with the sequence length. Previous work on adapting MCMC to modern hardware has therefore focused on running many independent chains in parallel. Here, we take an alternative approach: we propose algorithms to evaluate MCMC samplers in parallel across the chain length. To do this, we build on recent methods for parallel evaluation of nonlinear recursions that formulate the state sequence as a solution to a fixed-point problem and solve for the fixed-point using a parallel form of Newton's method. We show how this approach can be used to parallelize Gibbs, Metropolis-adjusted Langevin, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling across the sequence length. In several examples, we demonstrate the simulation of up to hundreds of thousands of MCMC samples with only tens of parallel Newton iterations. Additionally, we develop two new parallel quasi-Newton methods to evaluate nonlinear recursions with lower memory costs and reduced runtime. We find that the proposed parallel algorithms accelerate MCMC sampling across multiple examples, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude compared to sequential evaluation.</p></details> | 36 pages, 19 figures |

However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI'26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

| **[Instant Video Models: Universal Adapters for Stabilizing Image-Based Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03014v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lfranke.github.io/surffill</p></details> |
| **[TypeDis: A Type System for Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23358v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disentanglement is a runtime property of parallel programs guaranteeing that parallel tasks remain oblivious to each other's allocations. As demonstrated in the MaPLe compiler and run-time system, disentanglement can be exploited for fast automatic memory management, especially task-local garbage collection with no synchronization between parallel tasks. However, as a low-level property, disentanglement can be difficult to reason about for programmers. The only means of statically verifying disentanglement so far has been DisLog, an Iris-fueled variant of separation logic, mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant. DisLog is a fully-featured program logic, allowing for proof of functional correctness as well as verification of disentanglement. Yet its employment requires significant expertise and per-program proof effort. This paper explores the route of automatic verification via a type system, ensuring that any well-typed program is disentangled and lifting the burden of carrying out manual proofs from the programmer. It contributes TypeDis, a type system inspired by region types, where each type is annotated with a timestamp, identifying the task that allocated it. TypeDis supports iso-recursive types as well as polymorphism over both types and timestamps. Crucially, timestamps are allowed to change during type-checking, at join points as well as via a form of subtyping, dubbed subtiming. The paper illustrates TypeDis and its features on a range of examples. The soundness of TypeDis and the examples are mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant, using an improved version of DisLog, dubbed DisLog2.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 24 figures, extended version of the same paper accepted at POPL 2026</p></details> |

In contrast, we advocate for a primitive-based paradigm where urban scenes are represented using compact, semantically meaningful 3D elements that are easy to manipulate and compose. To this end, we introduce PrITTI, a latent diffusion model that leverages vectorized object primitives and rasterized ground surfaces for generating diverse, controllable, and editable 3D semantic urban scenes. This hybrid representation yields a structured latent space that facilitates object- and ground-level manipulation. Experiments on KITTI-360 show that primitive-based representations unlock the full capabilities of diffusion transformers, achieving state-of-the-art 3D scene generation quality with lower memory requirements, faster inference, and greater editability than voxel-based methods. Beyond generation, PrITTI supports a range of downstream applications, including scene editing, inpainting, outpainting, and photo-realistic street-view synthesis.

Deep learning provides a powerful alternative to traditional inference, but existing neural models typically lack the flexibility to handle variations in data analysis settings. Such variations accommodate imperfect observations or are required for specialized tests, and could include changes in detector configurations, overall frequency ranges, or localized cuts. We introduce a flexible transformer-based architecture paired with a training strategy that enables adaptation to diverse analysis settings at inference time. Applied to parameter estimation, we demonstrate that a single flexible model -- called Dingo-T1 -- can (i) analyze 48 gravitational-wave events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Observing Run under a wide range of analysis configurations, (ii) enable systematic studies of how detector and frequency configurations impact inferred posteriors, and (iii) perform inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests probing general relativity. Dingo-T1 also improves median sample efficiency on real events from a baseline of 1.4% to 4.2%. Our approach thus demonstrates flexible and scalable inference with a principled framework for handling missing or incomplete data -- key capabilities for current and next-generation observatories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+11 ...</summary><p>8+11 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |

Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at WACV 2026</p></details> |

Previous approaches have demonstrated exceptional performance in detecting texts fully generated by LLMs. However, these methods struggle when confronting more advanced LLM output or text with adversarial multi-task machine revision, especially in the black-box setting, where the generating model is unknown. To address this challenge, grounded in the hypothesis that human writing possesses distinctive stylistic patterns, we propose Human Language Preference Detection (HLPD). HLPD employs a reward-based alignment process, Human Language Preference Optimization (HLPO), to shift the scoring model's token distribution toward human-like writing, making the model more sensitive to human writing, therefore enhancing the identification of machine-revised text. We test HLPD in an adversarial multi-task evaluation framework that leverages a five-dimensional prompt generator and multiple advanced LLMs to create diverse revision scenarios. When detecting texts revised by GPT-series models, HLPD achieves a 15.11% relative improvement in AUROC over ImBD, surpassing Fast-DetectGPT by 45.56%. When evaluated on texts generated by advanced LLMs, HLPD achieves the highest average AUROC, exceeding ImBD by 5.53% and Fast-DetectGPT by 34.14%.

The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the INFORMS Journal on Data Science</p></details> |

This paper investigates efficient CoT transfer across models of different scales and architectures through an adaptive reasoning summarization framework. The proposed method compresses reasoning traces via semantic segmentation with importance scoring, budget-aware dynamic compression, and coherence reconstruction, preserving critical reasoning steps while significantly reducing token usage. Experiments on 7{,}501 medical examination questions across 10 specialties show up to 40% higher accuracy than truncation under the same token budgets. Evaluations on 64 model pairs from eight LLMs (1.5B-32B parameters, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3) confirm strong cross-model transferability. Furthermore, a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian optimization module reduces evaluation cost by 84% and reveals a power-law relationship between model size and cross-domain robustness. These results demonstrate that reasoning summarization provides a practical path toward efficient CoT transfer, enabling advanced reasoning under tight computational constraints.

While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.</p></details> | 33 pages, 14 figures |

However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods approached chance-level. OpenLVLM-MIA, designed to be transparent and unbiased benchmark, clarifies certain limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.</p></details> | WACV2026 Accepted |

This work presents an intermediate strategy, balancing performance and cost, by learning ODE integration using loss functions derived from the derivative-integral relationship, inspired by Monte Carlo integration and Picard iteration. From a geometric perspective, the losses operate by gradually extending the tangent to the secant, thus are named as secant losses. The target of secant losses is the same as that of diffusion models, or the diffusion model itself, leading to great training stability. By fine-tuning or distillation, the secant version of EDM achieves a $10$-step FID of $2.14$ on CIFAR-10, while the secant version of SiT-XL/2 attains a $4$-step FID of $2.27$ and an $8$-step FID of $1.96$ on ImageNet-$256\times256$.

We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for publication and is currently under review</p></details> |

However, in foggy scenes, scattering and attenuation can significantly degrade the quality of rendering. Although NeRF-based dehazing approaches have been developed, their reliance on deep fully connected neural networks and per-ray sampling strategies leads to high computational costs. Furthermore, NeRF's implicit representation limits its ability to recover fine-grained details from hazy scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose learning an explicit Gaussian representation to explain the formation mechanism of foggy images through a physically forward rendering process. Our method, DehazeGS, reconstructs and renders fog-free scenes using only multi-view foggy images as input. Specifically, based on the atmospheric scattering model, we simulate the formation of fog by establishing the transmission function directly onto Gaussian primitives via depth-to-transmission mapping. During training, we jointly learn the atmospheric light and scattering coefficients while optimizing the Gaussian representation of foggy scenes. At inference time, we remove the effects of scattering and attenuation in Gaussian distributions and directly render the scene to obtain dehazed views. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic foggy datasets demonstrate that DehazeGS achieves state-of-the-art performance. visualizations are available at https://dehazegs.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,5 figures.

However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

A common remedy is to sparsify the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and versatility of our multi-view approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a poster at the TAG-DS 2025 Workshop (Topology, Algebra, and Geometry in Data Science).

Linear constraints are useful in a wide range of applications, allowing the fitting of model with high-dimensional or highly collinear predictors, as well as encoding assumptions on the association between some or all predictors and the response. We propose the constrained iteratively-reweighted least squares (CIRLS) to fit the model, iterating quadratic programs to ensure the coefficient vector remains feasible according to the constraints. Inference for constrained coefficients can be obtained by simulating from a truncated multivariate normal distribution and computing empirical confidence intervals or variance-covariance matrix from the simulated coefficient vectors. We additionally discuss the complexity of a constrained GLM, proposing a measure of expected degrees of freedom which accounts for the stringency of constraints in the reduction of the model degrees of freedom. An extensive simulations study shows that constraining the coefficients introduces some bias to the estimation, but also decreases the estimator variance. This trade-off results in an improved estimator when constraints are chosen appropriately. The simulations also show that our proposed inference results in error in variance estimation and coverage. The proposed framework is illustrated on two case studies, showing its usefulness as well as some of its weaknesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer reviewed publication.

To address this challenge, autoevaluation methods leverage synthetic data produced by automated evaluators, such as LLMs-as-judges, reducing variance but potentially introducing bias. Recent approaches have employed semi-supervised prediction-powered inference (PPI) to correct for the bias of autoevaluators. However, the use of autoevaluators may lead in practice to a degradation in sample efficiency compared to conventional methods using only real-world data. In this paper, we propose R-AutoEval+, a novel framework that provides finite-sample reliability guarantees on the model evaluation, while also ensuring an enhanced (or at least no worse) sample efficiency compared to conventional methods. The key innovation of R-AutoEval+ is an adaptive construction of the model evaluation variable, which dynamically tunes its reliance on synthetic data, reverting to conventional methods when the autoevaluator is insufficiently accurate. Experiments on the use of LLMs-as-judges for the optimization of quantization settings for the weights of an LLM, for prompt design in LLMs, and for test-time reasoning budget allocation in LLMs confirm the reliability and efficiency of R-AutoEval+.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

However, existing methods struggle to balance personalization and generalization, often oversimplifying client similarities or relying too heavily on global models. In this paper, we propose FedSub, a novel approach that introduces class-aware model updates based on data prototypes and model subnetworks fusion to enhance personalization. Prototypes serve as compact representations of client data for each class, clustered on the server to capture label-specific similarities among the clients. Meanwhile, model subnetworks encapsulate the most relevant components to process each class and they are then fused on the server based on the identified clusters to generate fine-grained, class-specific, and highly personalized model updates for each client. Experimental results in three real-world scenarios with high data heterogeneity in human activity recognition and mobile health applications demonstrate the effectiveness of FedSub with respect to state-of-the-art methods to achieve fast convergence and high classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[DF-Mamba: Deformable State Space Modeling for 3D Hand Pose Estimation in Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02727v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

However, existing construction methods either depend on labor-intensive expert reasoning or on fully automated systems lacking expert involvement, creating a tension between scalability and interpretability. We introduce \textbf{XISM}, an interactive system that combines data-driven inference with expert knowledge. XISM generates candidate maps via a top-down procedure and allows users to iteratively refine edges in a visual interface, with real-time metric feedback. Experiments in three semantic domains and expert interviews show that XISM improves linguistic decision transparency and controllability in semantic-map construction while maintaining computational efficiency. XISM provides a collaborative approach for scalable and interpretable semantic-map building. The system\footnote{https://app.xism2025.xin/} , source code\footnote{https://github.com/hank317/XISM} , and demonstration video\footnote{https://youtu.be/m5laLhGn6Ys} are publicly available.</p></details> | Paper under review |
| **[Learning Egocentric In-Hand Object Segmentation through Weak Supervision from Human Narrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26004v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object interaction detection leveraging narrations $\unicode{x2013}$ natural language descriptions of the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about manipulated objects. We introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from natural-language narrations in a weakly-supervised regime. Narrations are then not employed at inference time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise annotations.

| **[PGP-DiffSR: Phase-Guided Progressive Pruning for Efficient Diffusion-based Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02681v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption. The code is available at https://github.com/yzb1997/PGP-DiffSR.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables.

| **[PRIMU: Uncertainty Estimation for Novel Views in Gaussian Splatting from Primitive-Based Representations of Error and Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02443v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Primitive-based Representations of Uncertainty (PRIMU), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation (UE) framework for Gaussian Splatting (GS). Reliable UE is essential for deploying GS in safety-critical domains such as robotics and medicine. Existing approaches typically estimate Gaussian-primitive variances and rely on the rendering process to obtain pixel-wise uncertainties. In contrast, we construct primitive-level representations of error and visibility/coverage from training views, capturing interpretable uncertainty information. These representations are obtained by projecting view-dependent training errors and coverage statistics onto the primitives. Uncertainties for novel views are inferred by rendering these primitive-level representations, producing uncertainty feature maps, which are aggregate through pixel-wise regression on holdout data. We analyze combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression models to understand how their interactions affect prediction accuracy and generalization. PRIMU also enables an effective active view selection strategy by directly leveraging these uncertainty feature maps. Additionally, we study the effect of separating splatting into foreground and background regions. Our estimates show strong correlations with true errors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially for depth UE and foreground objects. Finally, our regression models show generalization capabilities to unseen scenes, enabling UE without additional holdout data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised writing and figures; additional Gaussian Splatting experiments; added baselines and datasets; active view-selection experiments</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Tensor Kernel Machines to Enable Efficient Transfer Learning for Seizure Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02626v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Generative diffusion for perceptron problems: statistical physics analysis and efficient algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16292v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider random instances of non-convex perceptron problems in the high-dimensional limit of a large number of examples $M$ and weights $N$, with finite load $α= M/N$. We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $κ$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $α$-$κ$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3 mi...</summary><p>v3 minor revision after NeurIPS's rebuttal</p></details> |

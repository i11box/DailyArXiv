| **[A Survey of Self-Evolving Agents: On Path to Artificial Super Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21046v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks, evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g., models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages (e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards, textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents, highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare, and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety, scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously, performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.</p></details> | 51 pages, 9 figures |

However, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to system reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only perturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop user-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned perturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly enhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional baseline methods. Moreover, AUV-Fusion maintains exceptional stealth under rigorous scrutiny.</p></details> | 14 pages,6 figures |
| **[LCS: An AI-based Low-Complexity Scaler for Power-Efficient Super-Resolution of Game Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22873v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of content rendering in modern games has led to a problematic growth in the workload of the GPU. In this paper, we propose an AI-based low-complexity scaler (LCS) inspired by state-of-the-art efficient super-resolution (ESR) models which could offload the workload on the GPU to a low-power device such as a neural processing unit (NPU). The LCS is trained on GameIR image pairs natively rendered at low and high resolution. We utilize adversarial training to encourage reconstruction of perceptually important details, and apply reparameterization and quantization techniques to reduce model complexity and size. In our comparative analysis we evaluate the LCS alongside the publicly available AMD hardware-based Edge Adaptive Scaling Function (EASF) and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1 (FSR1) on five different metrics, and find that the LCS achieves better perceptual quality, demonstrating the potential of ESR models for upscaling on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[TR-PTS: Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection for Efficient Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22872v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable performance in vision tasks but are impractical for fine-tuning due to high computational and storage costs. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods mitigate this issue by updating only a subset of parameters; however, most existing approaches are task-agnostic, failing to fully exploit task-specific adaptations, which leads to suboptimal efficiency and performance. To address this limitation, we propose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven framework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most informative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining parameters frozen. Simultaneously, Task-Relevant Token Selection dynamically preserves the most informative tokens and merges redundant ones, reducing computational overhead. By jointly optimizing parameters and tokens, TR-PTS enables the model to concentrate on task-discriminative information. We evaluate TR-PTS on benchmark, including FGVC and VTAB-1k, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing full fine-tuning by 3.40% and 10.35%, respectively. The code are available at https://github.com/synbol/TR-PTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Federated Learning with On-device Training and Communication in 8-bit Floating Point](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02610v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown that 8-bit floating point (FP8) can be used for efficiently training neural networks with reduced computational cost compared to training in FP32/FP16. In this work, we investigate the use of FP8 training in a federated learning context. This approach brings not only the usual benefits of FP8 which are desirable for on-device training at the edge, but also reduces client-server communication costs due to significant weight compression. We present a novel method for combining FP8 client training while maintaining a global FP32 server model and provide convergence analysis. Experiments with various machine learning models and datasets show that our method consistently yields communication reductions of at least 2.9x across a variety of tasks and models compared to an FP32 baseline to achieve the same trained model accuracy.</p></details> | extended version |
| **[AVSim -- Realistic Simulation Framework for Airborne and Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06212v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational disease modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. While agent-based models (ABMs) provide detailed insights into individual dynamics, accurately replicating human motion remains challenging due to its complex, multi-factorial nature. Most existing frameworks fail to model realistic human motion, leading to oversimplified and less realistic behavior modeling. Furthermore, many current models rely on synthetic assumptions and fail to account for realistic environmental structures, transportation systems, and behavioral heterogeneity across occupation groups. To address these limitations, we introduce AVSim, an agent-based simulation framework designed to model airborne and vector-borne disease dynamics under realistic conditions. A distinguishing feature of AVSim is its ability to accurately model the dual nature of human mobility (both the destinations individuals visit and the duration of their stay) by utilizing GPS traces from real-world participants, characterized by occupation. This enables a significantly more granular and realistic representation of human movement compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, spectral clustering combined with graph-theoretic analysis is used to uncover latent behavioral patterns within occupations, enabling fine-grained modeling of agent behavior. We validate the synthetic human mobility patterns against ground-truth GPS data and demonstrate AVSim's capabilities via simulations of COVID-19 and dengue. The results highlight AVSim's capacity to trace infection pathways, identify high-risk zones, and evaluate interventions such as vaccination, quarantine, and vector control with occupational and geographic specificity.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 15 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems</p></details> |
| **[TextSAM-EUS: Text Prompt Learning for SAM to Accurately Segment Pancreatic Tumor in Endoscopic Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18082v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/TextSAM-EUS .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD</p></details> |
| **[Human-Level Competitive Pokémon via Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04395v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive Pok\'emon Singles (CPS) is a popular strategy game where players learn to exploit their opponent based on imperfect information in battles that can last more than one hundred stochastic turns. AI research in CPS has been led by heuristic tree search and online self-play, but the game may also create a platform to study adaptive policies trained offline on large datasets. We develop a pipeline to reconstruct the first-person perspective of an agent from logs saved from the third-person perspective of a spectator, thereby unlocking a dataset of real human battles spanning more than a decade that grows larger every day. This dataset enables a black-box approach where we train large sequence models to adapt to their opponent based solely on their input trajectory while selecting moves without explicit search of any kind. We study a progression from imitation learning to offline RL and offline fine-tuning on self-play data in the hardcore competitive setting of Pok\'emon's four oldest (and most partially observed) game generations. The resulting agents outperform a recent LLM Agent approach and a strong heuristic search engine. While playing anonymously in online battles against humans, our best agents climb to rankings inside the top 10% of active players. All agent checkpoints, training details, datasets, and baselines are available at https://metamon.tech.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reinf...</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22854v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time, freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by having access to a "simulator". By employing known classical and new quantum algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms from RL like "optimism in the face of uncertainty" and "posterior sampling" and instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al. (arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the $O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret, exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise all of our results to compact state spaces.</p></details> | 57 pages |
| **[Lightweight Online Adaption for Time Series Foundation Model Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12920v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series forecasting. While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose ELF to answer this question. ELF is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. ELF consists of two parts: a) the ELF-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the ELF-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the ELF-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of ELF in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using ELF improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, Published at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic analysis of free-free Timoshenko beams on elastic foundation under transverse transient ground deformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22850v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underground infrastructure, such as pipelines and tunnels, can be vulnerable to the effect of transient ground deformation (TGD) caused by different vibration sources, including earthquakes and traffic loads. Current design methods are based on simple analytical models that idealize the soil movement as a traveling sinusoidal wave, neglecting both the system's inertia and the relative displacement at the soil-structure interface. However, this assumption may not be valid for buried large diameter pipelines and tunnels requiring accurate dynamic analysis. To analyse the dynamic response of a buried straight beam subjected to transverse TGD, this study develops a new semi-analytical model based on the Timoshenko beam on Winkler foundation theory. The closed-form analytical solution revealed that the vibration spectrum is divided in four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. Across each transition frequency, the oscillatory characteristics of the vibration modes change, significantly affecting the dynamic response of the system. To verify the validity of the proposed model, this work analyses the case study of a buried steel water pipeline of varying lengths and operating conditions, subjected to transverse TGD. Comparison of the obtained analytical solutions with the finite element analysis results showed excellent agreement between the two approaches. The frequency response analysis revealed dynamic amplification of the soil-structure interaction for forcing frequencies near the system's fundamental frequency. These may fall within the range of dominant frequencies characterizing seismic waves, requiring accurate dynamic analysis. The proposed methodology provides a robust analytical framework for evaluating the primary factors impacting the dynamic behavior of buried beams, giving a deeper understanding of the system response under various sources of ground vibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Key w...</summary><p>Key words: buried Timoshenko beam, semi-analytical model, dynamic amplification, transient ground deformation (TGD), modal analysis</p></details> |
| **[Past Meets Present: Creating Historical Analogy with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14820v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historical analogies, which compare known past events with contemporary but unfamiliar events, are important abilities that help people make decisions and understand the world. However, research in applied history suggests that people have difficulty finding appropriate analogies. And previous studies in the AI community have also overlooked historical analogies. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on the historical analogy acquisition task, which aims to acquire analogous historical events for a given event. We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies. Through human evaluations and our specially designed automatic multi-dimensional assessment, we find that LLMs generally have a good potential for historical analogies. And the performance of the models can be further improved by using our self-reflection method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Outstanding Paper Award)</p></details> |
| **[Distance and Collision Probability Estimation from Gaussian Surface Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00186v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes continuous-space methodologies to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient between an ellipsoidal robot model and an environment surface modeled as a set of Gaussian distributions. Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Curvature Dynamic Black-box Attack: revisiting adversarial robustness via dynamic curvature estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19194v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attack reveals the vulnerability of deep learning models. For about a decade, countless attack and defense methods have been proposed, leading to robustified classifiers and better understanding of models. Among these methods, curvature-based approaches have attracted attention because it is assumed that high curvature may give rise to rough decision boundary. However, the most commonly used \textit{curvature} is the curvature of loss function, scores or other parameters from within the model as opposed to decision boundary curvature, since the former can be relatively easily formed using second order derivative. In this paper, we propose a new query-efficient method, dynamic curvature estimation(DCE), to estimate the decision boundary curvature in a black-box setting. Our approach is based on CGBA, a black-box adversarial attack. By performing DCE on a wide range of classifiers, we discovered, statistically, a connection between decision boundary curvature and adversarial robustness. We also propose a new attack method, curvature dynamic black-box attack(CDBA) with improved performance using the dynamically estimated curvature.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article contains several flaws</p></details> |

However, most existing methods rely heavily on direct text-to-speech training, limiting their flexibility in controlling nuanced style elements or timbral features. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{Latent State-Space} approach for text-driven voice conversion (\textbf{LSS-VC}). Our method treats each utterance as an evolving dynamical system in a continuous latent space. Drawing inspiration from mamba, which introduced a state-space model for efficient text-driven \emph{image} style transfer, we adapt a loosely related methodology for \emph{voice} style transformation. Specifically, we learn a voice latent manifold where style and content can be manipulated independently by textual style prompts. We propose an adaptive cross-modal fusion mechanism to inject style information into the voice latent representation, enabling interpretable and fine-grained control over speaker identity, speaking rate, and emphasis. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent baselines in both subjective and objective quality metrics, while offering smoother transitions between styles, reduced artifacts, and more precise text-based style control.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> |
| **[ReverBERT: A State Space Model for Efficient Text-Driven Speech Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20992v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven speech style transfer aims to mold the intonation, pace, and timbre of a spoken utterance to match stylistic cues from text descriptions. While existing methods leverage large-scale neural architectures or pre-trained language models, the computational costs often remain high. In this paper, we present \emph{ReverBERT}, an efficient framework for text-driven speech style transfer that draws inspiration from a state space model (SSM) paradigm, loosely motivated by the image-based method of Wang and Liu~\cite{wang2024stylemamba}. Unlike image domain techniques, our method operates in the speech space and integrates a discrete Fourier transform of latent speech features to enable smooth and continuous style modulation. We also propose a novel \emph{Transformer-based SSM} layer for bridging textual style descriptors with acoustic attributes, dramatically reducing inference time while preserving high-quality speech characteristics. Extensive experiments on benchmark speech corpora demonstrate that \emph{ReverBERT} significantly outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness, expressiveness, and computational efficiency. We release our model and code publicly to foster further research in text-driven speech style transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> |

Prior methods in cross-modal summarization have often suffered from high computational overheads and limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Cross-Modal State-Space Graph Reasoning} (\textbf{CSS-GR}) framework that incorporates a state-space model with graph-based message passing, inspired by prior work on efficient state-space models. Unlike existing approaches relying on purely sequential models, our method constructs a graph that captures inter- and intra-modal relationships, allowing more holistic reasoning over both textual and visual streams. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves summarization quality and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency, as validated on standard multimodal summarization benchmarks. We also provide a thorough ablation study to highlight the contributions of each component.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> |

However, the large number of layers and millions of parameters often make CNNs computationally expensive to train, requiring extensive time and manual tuning to discover optimal architectures. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for boosting CNN performance that integrates dynamic feature selection with the principles of BoostCNN. Our approach incorporates two key strategies: subgrid selection and importance sampling, to guide training toward informative regions of the feature space. We further develop a family of algorithms that embed boosting weights directly into the network training process using a least squares loss formulation. This integration not only alleviates the burden of manual architecture design but also enhances accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results across several fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate that our boosted CNN variants consistently outperform conventional CNNs in both predictive performance and training speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

The method relies on algorithms that are known to be efficiently implemented, such as the bidiagonal singular value decomposition and the symmetric eigenvalue decomposition. The advantages of this method stand for normal matrices with few real eigenvalues, such as orthogonal matrices. We provide a stability and a complexity analysis of the method. The numerical performance is compared with existing algorithms. In most cases, the method has the same operation count as the Hessenberg factorization of a dense matrix.

However, existing FPL approaches suffer from a trade-off between performance and robustness, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, limiting their reliability in real-world scenarios. The inherent in-distribution (ID) data heterogeneity among different clients makes it more challenging to maintain this trade-off. To fill this gap, we introduce a Federated OOD-aware Context Optimization (FOCoOp) framework, which captures diverse distributions among clients using ID global prompts, local prompts, and OOD prompts. Specifically, FOCoOp leverages three sets of prompts to create both class-level and distribution-level separations, which adapt to OOD shifts through bi-level distributionally robust optimization. Additionally, FOCoOp improves the discrimination consistency among clients, i.e., calibrating global prompts, seemingly OOD prompts, and OOD prompts by semi-unbalanced optimal transport. The extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that FOCoOp effectively captures decentralized heterogeneous distributions and enhances robustness of different OOD shifts.

To address these, we propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture heterogeneous operational features within individual series. (3) A frequency decoupled cross attention module that suppresses noise from irrelevant frequencies, focusing exclusively on meaningful dependencies within shared bands. Experiments on 4 real-world datasets demonstrate PAF-Net's superiority. It outperforms 10 well-acknowledged baselines by 7.06% lower MSE and 3.88% lower MAE.

We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL and model at https://huggingface.co/Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B</p></details> |
| **[Tapping into the Black Box: Uncovering Aligned Representations in Pretrained Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22832v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we argue that ReLU networks learn an implicit linear model we can actually tap into. We describe that alleged model formally and show that we can approximately pull its decision boundary back to the input space with certain simple modification to the backward pass. The resulting gradients (called excitation pullbacks) reveal high-resolution input- and target-specific features of remarkable perceptual alignment on a number of popular ImageNet-pretrained deep architectures. This strongly suggests that neural networks do, in fact, rely on learned interpretable patterns that can be recovered after training. Thus, our findings may have profound implications for knowledge discovery and the development of dependable artificial systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 4 figures, preprint</p></details> |

However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL'25 main track</p></details> |

However, NL plans are inherently ambiguous and lack structure, limiting their conversion into executable programs like SQL and hindering scalability, especially for multi-table tasks. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift to structured representations. We introduce a new structured plan, TaSoF, inspired by formalism in traditional multi-agent systems, and a framework, SPaGe, that formalizes the reasoning process in three phases: 1) Structured Planning to generate TaSoF from a query, 2) Graph-based Execution to convert plan steps into SQL and model dependencies via a directed cyclic graph for parallel execution, and 3) Summary Generation to produce query-focused summaries. Our method explicitly captures complex dependencies and improves reliability. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that SPaGe consistently outperforms prior models in both single- and multi-table settings, demonstrating the advantages of structured representations for robust and scalable summarization.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, and 5 tables</p></details> |

Existing approaches to reconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry, semantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose CapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level semantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate features without image reconstruction. We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating strong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up to 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from ResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis further reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more semantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage, we introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to intermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer. Experimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without additional training costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, accepted by the 2025 ACM Multimedia Conference</p></details> |

Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout. Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference. Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[DISTIL: Data-Free Inversion of Suspicious Trojan Inputs via Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22813v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious concerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A common countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious "shortcut" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training. Current trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under specific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more than an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose a data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search space while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we incorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier; through iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the internal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical evaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach reconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned models. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to 7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on trojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction for reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong prior assumptions about triggers.

This work introduces Query-Based Retrieval Augmented Generation (QB-RAG), a framework for enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in healthcare question-answering by pre-aligning user queries with a database of curated, answerable questions derived from healthcare content. A key component of QB-RAG is an LLM-based filtering mechanism that ensures that only relevant and answerable questions are included in the database, enabling reliable reference query generation at scale. We provide theoretical motivation for QB-RAG, conduct a comparative analysis of existing retrieval enhancement techniques, and introduce a generalizable, comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses both the retrieval effectiveness and the quality of the generated response based on faithfulness, relevance, and adherence to the guideline. Our empirical evaluation on a healthcare data set demonstrates the superior performance of QB-RAG compared to existing retrieval methods, highlighting its practical value in building trustworthy digital health applications for health question-answering.</p></details> | 27 pages |

Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. However, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have historically been rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching architecture that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods in most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, ICCV accepted paper</p></details> |

However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for scalable auto-labeling.

Motivated by the limitations of conventional top-down approaches such as optimization, the framework instead models structures as compositions of predefined elements, aligning form finding with practical constraints like constructability and component reuse. With the formulation of the design task as a sequential decision-making problem and a human learning inspired training algorithm, the method adapts reinforcement learning for structural design. The framework is demonstrated by designing steel braced truss frame cantilever structures, where trained policies consistently generate distinct, high-performing designs that display structural performance and material efficiency with the use of structural strategies that align with known engineering principles. Further analysis shows that the agent efficiently narrows its search to promising regions of the design space, revealing transferable structural knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures (IASS) 2025 Symposium</p></details> |

The localization process, which has been performed manually for decades, has recently been approached through image retrieval solutions: given an astronaut photo, find its most similar match among a large database of geo-tagged satellite images, in a task called Astronaut Photography Localization (APL). Yet, existing APL approaches are trained only using satellite images, without taking advantage of the millions open-source astronaut photos. In this work we present the first APL pipeline capable of leveraging astronaut photos for training. We first produce full localization information for 300,000 manually weakly labeled astronaut photos through an automated pipeline, and then use these images to train a model, called AstroLoc. AstroLoc learns a robust representation of Earth's surface features through two losses: astronaut photos paired with their matching satellite counterparts in a pairwise loss, and a second loss on clusters of satellite imagery weighted by their relevance to astronaut photography via unsupervised mining. We find that AstroLoc achieves a staggering 35% average improvement in recall@1 over previous SOTA, pushing the limits of existing datasets with a recall@100 consistently over 99%. Finally, we note that AstroLoc, without any fine-tuning, provides excellent results for related tasks like the lost-in-space satellite problem and historical space imagery localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://astro-loc.github.io/</p></details> |

However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of 0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing prenatal care in resource-limited settings.

Standard techniques, such as finetuning or low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are successful at domain adaptation, but do not formally add capacity to the model. This often leads to a trade-off, between performing well on the new domain vs. degrading performance on the original domain. Here, we revisit and improve adapters to extend LLMs from three angles: data, architecture and training procedure, which are advantageously considered jointly. The resulting method, called neutral residues, modifies adapters in a way that leads each new residual block to output near-zeros on the original domain. This solution leads to strong results when adapting a state-of-the-art model originally trained on English to a new language. Neutral residues significantly outperform competing approaches such as finetuning, LoRA or vanilla adapters in terms of the trade-off between learning the new language and not forgetting English.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |

While traditional models are often based on the assumption that all individuals have the same probability of infecting every other individual in the population, a so-called random homogeneous mixing, they struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of real-world human interactions. Recent advancements in data-driven methodologies and computational capabilities have unlocked the potential of integrating high-resolution human mobility data into epidemic modeling, significantly improving the accuracy, timeliness, and applicability of epidemic risk assessment, contact tracing, and intervention strategies. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current landscape in human mobility-informed epidemic modeling. We explore diverse sources and representations of human mobility data, and then examine the behavioral and structural roles of mobility and contact in shaping disease transmission dynamics. Furthermore, the review spans a wide range of epidemic modeling approaches, ranging from classical compartmental models to network-based, agent-based, and machine learning models. And we also discuss how mobility integration enhances risk management and response strategies during epidemics. By synthesizing these insights, the review can serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners, bridging the gap between epidemiological theory and the dynamic complexities of human interaction while charting clear directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

As a critical issue facing LM distillation, a superior student often arises from a teacher of a relatively small scale instead of a larger one, especially in the presence of substantial capacity gap between the teacher and student. This issue, often referred to as the \textit{curse of capacity gap}, suggests that there is likely an optimal teacher yielding the best-performing student along the scaling course of the teacher. Consequently, distillation trials on teachers of a wide range of scales are called for to determine the optimal teacher, which becomes computationally intensive in the context of large LMs (LLMs). This paper addresses this critical bottleneck by providing the \textit{law of capacity gap} inducted from a preliminary study on distilling a broad range of small-scale (<3B) LMs, where the optimal teacher consistently scales linearly with the student scale across different model and data scales. By extending the law to LLM distillation on a larger scale (7B), we succeed in obtaining versatile LLMs that outperform a wide array of competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 10 figures, 15 tables, accepted to ACL 2025.

However, their robustness against adversarial attacks remains largely underexplored, posing significant risks to system reliability and security. Existing attack strategies suffer from notable limitations: shilling attacks are costly and detectable, and visual-only perturbations often fail to align with user preferences. To address these challenges, we propose AUV-Fusion, a cross-modal adversarial attack framework that adopts high-order user preference modeling and cross-modal adversary generation. Specifically, we obtain robust user embeddings through multi-hop user-item interactions and transform them via an MLP into semantically aligned perturbations. These perturbations are injected onto the latent space of a pre-trained VAE within the diffusion model. By synergistically integrating genuine user interaction data with visually plausible perturbations, AUV-Fusion eliminates the need for injecting fake user profiles and effectively mitigates the challenge of insufficient user preference extraction inherent in traditional visual-only attacks. Comprehensive evaluations on diverse VARS architectures and real-world datasets demonstrate that AUV-Fusion significantly enhances the exposure of target (cold-start) items compared to conventional baseline methods. Moreover, AUV-Fusion maintains exceptional stealth under rigorous scrutiny.</p></details> | 14 pages,6 figures |

In this work, we investigate the use of FP8 training in a federated learning context. This approach brings not only the usual benefits of FP8 which are desirable for on-device training at the edge, but also reduces client-server communication costs due to significant weight compression. We present a novel method for combining FP8 client training while maintaining a global FP32 server model and provide convergence analysis. Experiments with various machine learning models and datasets show that our method consistently yields communication reductions of at least 2.9x across a variety of tasks and models compared to an FP32 baseline to achieve the same trained model accuracy.</p></details> | extended version |

AI research in CPS has been led by heuristic tree search and online self-play, but the game may also create a platform to study adaptive policies trained offline on large datasets. We develop a pipeline to reconstruct the first-person perspective of an agent from logs saved from the third-person perspective of a spectator, thereby unlocking a dataset of real human battles spanning more than a decade that grows larger every day. This dataset enables a black-box approach where we train large sequence models to adapt to their opponent based solely on their input trajectory while selecting moves without explicit search of any kind. We study a progression from imitation learning to offline RL and offline fine-tuning on self-play data in the hardcore competitive setting of Pok\'emon's four oldest (and most partially observed) game generations. The resulting agents outperform a recent LLM Agent approach and a strong heuristic search engine. While playing anonymously in online battles against humans, our best agents climb to rankings inside the top 10% of active players.

Continuous-space collision probability estimation is critical for uncertainty-aware motion planning. Most collision detection and avoidance approaches assume the robot is modeled as a sphere, but ellipsoidal representations provide tighter approximations and enable navigation in cluttered and narrow spaces. State-of-the-art methods derive the Euclidean distance and gradient by processing raw point clouds, which is computationally expensive for large workspaces. Recent advances in Gaussian surface modeling (e.g. mixture models, splatting) enable compressed and high-fidelity surface representations. Few methods exist to estimate continuous-space occupancy from such models. They require Gaussians to model free space and are unable to estimate the collision probability, Euclidean distance and gradient for an ellipsoidal robot. The proposed methods bridge this gap by extending prior work in ellipsoid-to-ellipsoid Euclidean distance and collision probability estimation to Gaussian surface models. A geometric blending approach is also proposed to improve collision probability estimation. The approaches are evaluated with numerical 2D and 3D experiments using real-world point cloud data. Methods for efficient calculation of these quantities are demonstrated to execute within a few microseconds per ellipsoid pair using a single-thread on low-power CPUs of modern embedded computers</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing methods rely heavily on direct text-to-speech training, limiting their flexibility in controlling nuanced style elements or timbral features. In this paper, we propose a novel \textbf{Latent State-Space} approach for text-driven voice conversion (\textbf{LSS-VC}). Our method treats each utterance as an evolving dynamical system in a continuous latent space. Drawing inspiration from mamba, which introduced a state-space model for efficient text-driven \emph{image} style transfer, we adapt a loosely related methodology for \emph{voice} style transformation. Specifically, we learn a voice latent manifold where style and content can be manipulated independently by textual style prompts. We propose an adaptive cross-modal fusion mechanism to inject style information into the voice latent representation, enabling interpretable and fine-grained control over speaker identity, speaking rate, and emphasis. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent baselines in both subjective and objective quality metrics, while offering smoother transitions between styles, reduced artifacts, and more precise text-based style control.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> |

While existing methods leverage large-scale neural architectures or pre-trained language models, the computational costs often remain high. In this paper, we present \emph{ReverBERT}, an efficient framework for text-driven speech style transfer that draws inspiration from a state space model (SSM) paradigm, loosely motivated by the image-based method of Wang and Liu~\cite{wang2024stylemamba}. Unlike image domain techniques, our method operates in the speech space and integrates a discrete Fourier transform of latent speech features to enable smooth and continuous style modulation. We also propose a novel \emph{Transformer-based SSM} layer for bridging textual style descriptors with acoustic attributes, dramatically reducing inference time while preserving high-quality speech characteristics. Extensive experiments on benchmark speech corpora demonstrate that \emph{ReverBERT} significantly outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness, expressiveness, and computational efficiency.

To address these, we propose PAF-Net, a frequency decoupled time series prediction framework with three key innovations: (1) A phase-correlation alignment method guided by frequency domain energy to synchronize time-lagged quality series, resolving temporal misalignment. (2) A frequency independent patch attention mechanism paired with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) decomposition to capture heterogeneous operational features within individual series.

However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL'25 main track</p></details> |

This map assigns to each direction $v\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ the persistent homology of the filtration of $M$ in direction $v$. In practice, one can only sample the map $\text{PHT}(M)$ at a finite set of directions $A \subset \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. This suggests two natural questions: (1) Can we interpolate the PHT from this finite sample of directions to the entire sphere? If so, (2) can we prove that the resulting interpolation is close to the true PHT? In this paper we show that if we can sample the PHT at the module level, where we have information about how homology from each direction interacts, a ready-made interpolation theory due to Bubenik, de Silva, and Nanda using Kan extensions can answer both of these questions in the affirmative. A close inspection of those techniques shows that we can infer the PHT from a finite sample of heights from each direction as well.

| **[$S^2M^2$: Scalable Stereo Matching Model for Reliable Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13229v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing well across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. However, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have historically been rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching architecture that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods in most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, ICCV accepted paper</p></details> |

However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers, posing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of trained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a vision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal ultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image quality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN and Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of 0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed for classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.771. Our work demonstrates how parameter-efficient fine-tuning of fetal ultrasound foundation models can enable task-specific adaptations, advancing prenatal care in resource-limited settings.

| **[Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02038v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV2025 |
| **[Social-Pose: Enhancing Trajectory Prediction with Human Body Pose](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22742v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate human trajectory prediction is one of the most crucial tasks for autonomous driving, ensuring its safety. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the visual cues that humans subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. In this work, we study the benefits of predicting human trajectories using human body poses instead of solely their Cartesian space locations in time. We propose `Social-pose', an attention-based pose encoder that effectively captures the poses of all humans in a scene and their social relations. Our method can be integrated into various trajectory prediction architectures. We have conducted extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models (based on LSTM, GAN, MLP, and Transformer), and showed improvements over all of them on synthetic (Joint Track Auto) and real (Human3.6M, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and JRDB) datasets. We also explored the advantages of using 2D versus 3D poses, as well as the effect of noisy poses and the application of our pose-based predictor in robot navigation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS)</p></details> |

Additionally, code verification has recently found great success as a critical component in improving reasoning capability of LLMs via reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose an approach which can transform existing coding benchmarks into scoring and ranking datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic verifiers. We also propose multiple metrics to measure different aspects of the synthetic verifiers with the proposed benchmarks. By employing the proposed approach, we release four new benchmarks (HE-R, HE-R+, MBPP-R, and MBPP-R+), and analyzed synthetic verification methods with standard, reasoning-based, and reward-based LLMs. Our experiments show that reasoning can significantly improve test case generation and that scaling the number of test cases enhances the verification accuracy.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[RocketStack: Level-aware deep recursive ensemble learning framework with adaptive feature fusion and model pruning dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16965v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model. However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE) filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class), linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached 98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression. These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive ensembling with tractable complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 1 graphical abstract, 7 figures, 9 tables, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we study co-speech gesture generation with an emphasis on specific hand gesture activation, which can deliver more instructional information than common body movements. To achieve this, we first build a high-quality dataset of 3D human body movements including a set of semantically explicit hand gestures that are commonly used by live streamers. Then we present a hybrid-modality gesture generation system GestureHYDRA built upon a hybrid-modality diffusion transformer architecture with novelly designed motion-style injective transformer layers, which enables advanced gesture modeling ability and versatile gesture operations. To guarantee these specific hand gestures can be activated, we introduce a cascaded retrieval-augmented generation strategy built upon a semantic gesture repository annotated for each subject and an adaptive audio-gesture synchronization mechanism, which substantially improves semantic gesture activation and production efficiency. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance over all the counterparts.

| **[Enhancing Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models Through Saliency-Aware Partial Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13932v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85% and 7.54% respectively. A Python implementation of the proposed quantization method is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/TokuyuSou/ULB-SAPR.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a post-peer-review accepted manuscript from the proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI'25).

To ensure holistic and fair evaluations, we propose a novel and comprehensive framework that explores ``365'' aspects of interview performance by integrating \textit{three} modalities (video, audio, and text), \textit{six} responses per candidate, and \textit{five} key evaluation dimensions. The framework employs modality-specific feature extractors to encode heterogeneous data streams and subsequently fused via a Shared Compression Multilayer Perceptron. This module compresses multimodal embeddings into a unified latent space, facilitating efficient feature interaction. To enhance prediction robustness, we incorporate a two-level ensemble learning strategy: (1) independent regression heads predict scores for each response, and (2) predictions are aggregated across responses using a mean-pooling mechanism to produce final scores for the five target dimensions. By listening to the unspoken, our approach captures both explicit and implicit cues from multimodal data, enabling comprehensive and unbiased assessments. Achieving a multi-dimensional average MSE of 0.1824, our framework secured first place in the AVI Challenge 2025, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in advancing automated and multimodal interview performance assessment.

Existing methods typically adopt data augmentation to alleviate the burden of large-scale annotation. However, most augmentation strategies only focus on local transformations or semantic recomposition, lacking the consideration of global structural dependencies within scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a graph-guided data augmentation framework with dual-level constraints for realistic 3D scene synthesis. Our method learns object relationship statistics from real-world data to construct guiding graphs for scene generation. Local-level constraints enforce geometric plausibility and semantic consistency between objects, while global-level constraints maintain the topological structure of the scene by aligning the generated layout with the guiding graph. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our framework generates diverse and high-quality augmented scenes, leading to consistent improvements in point cloud segmentation performance across various models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, to be published in ACMMM 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[UniLegs: Universal Multi-Legged Robot Control through Morphology-Agnostic Policy Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22653v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing controllers that generalize across diverse robot morphologies remains a significant challenge in legged locomotion. Traditional approaches either create specialized controllers for each morphology or compromise performance for generality. This paper introduces a two-stage teacher-student framework that bridges this gap through policy distillation. First, we train specialized teacher policies optimized for individual morphologies, capturing the unique optimal control strategies for each robot design. Then, we distill this specialized expertise into a single Transformer-based student policy capable of controlling robots with varying leg configurations. Our experiments across five distinct legged morphologies demonstrate that our approach preserves morphology-specific optimal behaviors, with the Transformer architecture achieving 94.47\% of teacher performance on training morphologies and 72.64\% on unseen robot designs. Comparative analysis reveals that Transformer-based architectures consistently outperform MLP baselines by leveraging attention mechanisms to effectively model joint relationships across different kinematic structures. We validate our approach through successful deployment on a physical quadruped robot, demonstrating the practical viability of our morphology-agnostic control framework. This work presents a scalable solution for developing universal legged robot controllers that maintain near-optimal performance while generalizing across diverse morphologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, IROS 2025</p></details> |

Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D microscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for microglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Existing segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with overlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter tuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We introduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia segmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage approach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects somas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the same architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections, refines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a 3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases: self-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch Segmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and evaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly improves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis of complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its architecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Tropical solution of discrete best approximation problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22634v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider discrete best approximation problems in the setting of tropical algebra that is concerned with the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of input-output pairs of an unknown function defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an approximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator and denominator. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the approximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial in the polynomials to fit the rational function to the data in the sense of a tropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into approximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides, where one side corresponds to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the denominator. Each side involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown exponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients of monomials. We propose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by alternately fixing one side of the equation to an already found result and leaving the other intact. Each equation obtained is approximated with respect to the vector of coefficients, which yields a vector of coefficients and approximation error both parameterized by the exponents. The exponents are found by minimizing the error with an optimization procedure based on agglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate, we present results for approximation problems in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with addition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which correspond to ordinary problems of piecewise linear approximation of real functions. As our numerical experience shows, the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and provides a reasonable solution to the problems considered.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Previous studies have not fully resolved the challenges of tumor boundary segmentation insensitivity and feature transfer in the absence of key imaging modalities. In this study, we introduce MST-KDNet, aimed at addressing these critical issues. Our model features Multi-Scale Transformer Knowledge Distillation to effectively capture attention weights at various resolutions, Dual-Mode Logit Distillation to improve the transfer of knowledge, and a Global Style Matching Module that integrates feature matching with adversarial learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the BraTS and FeTS 2024 datasets demonstrate that MST-KDNet surpasses current leading methods in both Dice and HD95 scores, particularly in conditions with substantial modality loss. Our approach shows exceptional robustness and generalization potential, making it a promising candidate for real-world clinical applications.

However, harnessing the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain, particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) 2024</p></details> |

However, adversaries may misuse such techniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages into harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work, we take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful illusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation models. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable Diffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are hateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or subtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models (VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal significant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection accuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs. We further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which mainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary layer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore preliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from the perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, the quadratic scaling of parameter count and computational complexity (FLOPs) with respect to kernel size poses significant efficiency and optimization challenges. This paper introduces RecConv, a recursive decomposition strategy that efficiently constructs multi-frequency representations using small-kernel convolutions. RecConv establishes a linear relationship between parameter growth and decomposing levels which determines the effective receptive field $k\times 2^\ell$ for a base kernel $k$ and $\ell$ levels of decomposition, while maintaining constant FLOPs regardless of the ERF expansion. Specifically, RecConv achieves a parameter expansion of only $\ell+2$ times and a maximum FLOPs increase of $5/3$ times, compared to the exponential growth ($4^\ell$) of standard and depthwise convolutions. RecNeXt-M3 outperforms RepViT-M1.1 by 1.9 $AP^{box}$ on COCO with similar FLOPs. This innovation provides a promising avenue towards designing efficient and compact networks across various modalities.

In this work, we propose a new perspective on the denoising challenge by highlighting the distinct separation between noise and image priors. This insight forms the basis for our development of conditional optimization framework, designed to overcome the constraints of traditional denoising framework. To this end, we introduce a Locally Noise Prior Estimation (LoNPE) algorithm, which accurately estimates the noise prior directly from a single raw noisy image. This estimation acts as an explicit prior representation of the camera sensor's imaging environment, distinct from the image prior of scenes. Additionally, we design an auxiliary learnable LoNPE network tailored for practical application to sRGB noisy images. Leveraging the estimated noise prior, we present a novel Conditional Denoising Transformer (Condformer), by incorporating the noise prior into a conditional self-attention mechanism. This integration allows the Condformer to segment the optimization process into multiple explicit subspaces, significantly enhancing the model's generalization and flexibility. Extensive experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-art methods.

The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure.

To meet the complex demands of sequential tasks, it is crucial to integrate task-specific knowledge within prompts effectively. However, existing works rely on either fixed learned prompts (i.e., prompts whose representations remain unchanged during new task learning) or on prompts generated from an entangled task-shared space, limiting the representational diversity of the integrated prompt. To address this issue, we propose a novel prompt-evolving mechanism to adaptively aggregate base prompts (i.e., task-specific prompts) into a unified prompt while ensuring diversity. By transforming and aligning base prompts, both previously learned and newly introduced, our approach continuously evolves accumulated knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. We further introduce a learnable probabilistic gate that adaptively determines which layers to activate during the evolution process. We validate our method on image classification and video action recognition tasks in class-incremental learning, achieving average gains of 9.07% and 7.40% over existing methods across all scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2025)</p></details> |

While many methods compress neural network parameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To address this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP) framework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian function to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the computational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we introduce Gr\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the fractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each kernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional Gaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured Pruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various architectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent methods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a 1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%. On ImageNet2012, ResNet-50 achieves only a 1.63% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 69.1%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, Accepted by ICML 2025 Workshop (TTODLer-FM)</p></details> |

Recent AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets, which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights, training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical deployment.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

We present a multi-agent interactive intelligent system for medical triage that addresses three fundamental challenges in current AI-based triage systems: insufficient medical specialization leading to hallucination-induced misclassifications, heterogeneous department structures across healthcare institutions, and inefficient detail-oriented questioning that impedes rapid triage decisions. Our system employs three specialized agents - RecipientAgent, InquirerAgent, and DepartmentAgent - that collaborate through structured inquiry mechanisms and department-specific guidance rules to transform unstructured patient symptoms into accurate department recommendations. To ensure robust evaluation, we constructed a comprehensive Chinese medical triage dataset from a medical website, comprising 3,360 real-world cases spanning 9 primary departments and 62 secondary departments. Through systematic data imputation using large language models, we address the prevalent issue of incomplete medical records in real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent system achieves 89.2% accuracy in primary department classification and 73.9% accuracy in secondary department classification after four rounds of patient interaction. The system's pattern-matching-based guidance mechanisms enable efficient adaptation to diverse hospital configurations while maintaining high triage accuracy. Our work provides a scalable framework for deploying AI-assisted triage systems that can accommodate the organizational heterogeneity of healthcare institutions while ensuring clinically sound decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 2 table</p></details> |

However, recent AiO solutions still struggle to capture diverse degradations, since global filtering methods like direct operations on the frequency domain fail to handle highly variable and localized distortions. To address these issue, we propose Spectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that leverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather image restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge features using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via Singular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to effectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features are integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions based on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask, we introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather removal and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions. We also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel attention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise relationships and spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our approach, validating its effectiveness in handling the varied and intricate adverse weather degradations.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV25 |
| **[Emergence of Quantised Representations Isolated to Anisotropic Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12070v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel methodology for determining representational alignment, which builds upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Particularly, this new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can emerge and organise in autoencoder models, through a controlled ablation study in which only the activation function is altered. Using this technique, the validity of whether function-driven symmetries can act as implicit inductive biases on representations is determined. Representations are found to tend to discretise when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. This confirms the hypothesis: algebraic symmetries of network primitives can carry unintended inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in representations. The discrete symmetry of contemporary forms is shown to be a strong predictor for the induction of discrete representations transformed from otherwise continuous structures -- a quantisation effect. This motivates further reassessment of functional forms in common usage. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 31 figures, edited some introductory phrasing, conclusion and appendices</p></details> |

However, 3DGS still faces major efficiency challenges when faced with high frame rate requirements and resource-constrained edge deployment. To enable efficient 3DGS, in this paper, we propose LS-Gaussian, an algorithm/hardware co-design framework for lightweight streaming 3D rendering. LS-Gaussian is motivated by the core observation that 3DGS suffers from substantial computation redundancy and stalls. On one hand, in practical scenarios, high-frame-rate 3DGS is often applied in settings where a camera observes and renders the same scene continuously but from slightly different viewpoints. Therefore, instead of rendering each frame separately, LS-Gaussian proposes a viewpoint transformation algorithm that leverages inter-frame continuity for efficient sparse rendering. On the other hand, as different tiles within an image are rendered in parallel but have imbalanced workloads, frequent hardware stalls also slow down the rendering process. LS-Gaussian predicts the workload for each tile based on viewpoint transformation to enable more balanced parallel computation and co-designs a customized 3DGS accelerator to support the workload-aware mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that LS-Gaussian achieves 5.41x speedup over the edge GPU baseline on average and up to 17.3x speedup with the customized accelerator, while incurring only minimal visual quality degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Convergence Properties of Natural Gradient Descent for Minimizing KL Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19259v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence plays a central role in probabilistic machine learning, where it commonly serves as the canonical loss function. Optimization in such settings is often performed over the probability simplex, where the choice of parameterization significantly impacts convergence. In this work, we study the problem of minimizing the KL divergence and analyze the behavior of gradient-based optimization algorithms under two dual coordinate systems within the framework of information geometry$-$ the exponential family ($\theta$ coordinates) and the mixture family ($\eta$ coordinates). We compare Euclidean gradient descent (GD) in these coordinates with the coordinate-invariant natural gradient descent (NGD), where the natural gradient is a Riemannian gradient that incorporates the intrinsic geometry of the underlying statistical model. In continuous time, we prove that the convergence rates of GD in the $\theta$ and $\eta$ coordinates provide lower and upper bounds, respectively, on the convergence rate of NGD. Moreover, under affine reparameterizations of the dual coordinates, the convergence rates of GD in $\eta$ and $\theta$ coordinates can be scaled to $2c$ and $\frac{2}{c}$, respectively, for any $c>0$, while NGD maintains a fixed convergence rate of $2$, remaining invariant to such transformations and sandwiched between them. Although this suggests that NGD may not exhibit uniformly superior convergence in continuous time, we demonstrate that its advantages become pronounced in discrete time, where it achieves faster convergence and greater robustness to noise, outperforming GD. Our analysis hinges on bounding the spectrum and condition number of the Hessian of the KL divergence at the optimum, which coincides with the Fisher information matrix.</p></details> | <details><summary>repla...</summary><p>replaced earlier draft with the camera-ready version published at tmlr</p></details> |
| **[Estimating 2D Camera Motion with Hybrid Motion Basis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22480v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating 2D camera motion is a fundamental computer vision task that models the projection of 3D camera movements onto the 2D image plane. Current methods rely on either homography-based approaches, limited to planar scenes, or meshflow techniques that use grid-based local homographies but struggle with complex non-linear transformations. A key insight of our work is that combining flow fields from different homographies creates motion patterns that cannot be represented by any single homography. We introduce CamFlow, a novel framework that represents camera motion using hybrid motion bases: physical bases derived from camera geometry and stochastic bases for complex scenarios. Our approach includes a hybrid probabilistic loss function based on the Laplace distribution that enhances training robustness. For evaluation, we create a new benchmark by masking dynamic objects in existing optical flow datasets to isolate pure camera motion. Experiments show CamFlow outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenarios, demonstrating superior robustness and generalization in zero-shot settings.

However, its distributed nature makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks, particularly in NLP tasks, where related research remains limited. This paper introduces SDBA, a novel backdoor attack mechanism designed for NLP tasks in federated learning environments. Through a systematic analysis across LSTM and GPT-2 models, we identify the most vulnerable layers for backdoor injection and achieve both stealth and long-lasting durability by applying layer-wise gradient masking and top-k% gradient masking. Also, to evaluate the task generalizability of SDBA, we additionally conduct experiments on the T5 model. Experiments on next-token prediction, sentiment analysis, and question answering tasks show that SDBA outperforms existing backdoors in terms of durability and effectively bypasses representative defense mechanisms, demonstrating notable performance in transformer-based models such as GPT-2. These results highlight the urgent need for robust defense strategies in NLP-based federated learning systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing.

Unlike earlier Falcon models built solely on Transformer or Mamba architectures, Falcon-H1 adopts a parallel hybrid approach that combines Transformer-based attention with State Space Models (SSMs), known for superior long-context memory and computational efficiency. We systematically revisited model design, data strategy, and training dynamics, challenging conventional practices in the field. Falcon-H1 is released in multiple configurations, including base and instruction-tuned variants at 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B parameters. Quantized instruction-tuned models are also available, totaling over 30 checkpoints on Hugging Face Hub. Falcon-H1 models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and exceptional parameter and training efficiency. The flagship Falcon-H1-34B matches or outperforms models up to 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B, and Llama3.3-70B, while using fewer parameters and less data. Smaller models show similar trends: the Falcon-H1-1.5B-Deep rivals current leading 7B-10B models, and Falcon-H1-0.5B performs comparably to typical 7B models from 2024. These models excel across reasoning, mathematics, multilingual tasks, instruction following, and scientific knowledge. With support for up to 256K context tokens and 18 languages, Falcon-H1 is suitable for a wide range of applications. All models are released under a permissive open-source license, underscoring our commitment to accessible and impactful AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report of Falcon-H1 model series</p></details> |

The proposed network takes as input the noisy and reverberant microphone recording and predicts the corresponding clean Mel-spectrogram. The enhanced Mel-spectrogram can be either transformed to the speech waveform with a neural vocoder or directly used for ASR. The proposed network is composed of interleaved cross-band and narrow-band processing in the Mel-frequency domain, for learning the full-band spectral pattern and the narrow-band properties of signals, respectively. Compared to linear-frequency domain or time-domain speech enhancement, the key advantage of Mel-spectrogram enhancement is that Mel-frequency presents speech in a more compact way and thus is easier to learn, which will benefit both speech quality and ASR. Experimental results on five English and one Chinese datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in both speech quality and ASR performance achieved by the proposed model.Code and audio examples of our model are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to IEEE/ACM Trans. on TASLP</p></details> |
| **[Comparing Normalizing Flows with Kernel Density Estimation in Estimating Risk of Automated Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22429v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach, where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS, comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality. As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more precise assessment of an ADS's safety. This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in proceedings of the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference</p></details> |

Unlike prior approaches that rely on recurrent architectures or post hoc extraction methods, our formulation symbolically encodes automaton states as binary vectors, transitions as sparse linear transformations, and nondeterministic branching - including {\epsilon}-closures - as compositions of shared ReLU layers. We prove that every regular language can be recognized exactly by a depth-unrolled ReLU network with shared parameters, independent of input length. Our construction yields not only formal equivalence between NFAs and ReLU networks, but also practical trainability: we demonstrate that the networks can learn NFA acceptance behavior through gradient descent using standard supervised data. Extensive experiments validate all theoretical results, achieving perfect or near-perfect agreement on acceptance, state propagation, and closure dynamics. This work establishes a new bridge between symbolic automata theory and modern neural architectures, showing that feedforward networks can perform precise, interpretable, and trainable symbolic computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, with proofs in Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability and practicality of our proposed planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2025.

Nonetheless, previous models often falter when segmenting small, irregularly shaped tumors. To this end, we introduce SMAFormer, an efficient, Transformer-based architecture that fuses multiple attention mechanisms for enhanced segmentation of small tumors and organs. SMAFormer can capture both local and global features for medical image segmentation. The architecture comprises two pivotal components. First, a Synergistic Multi-Attention (SMA) Transformer block is proposed, which has the benefits of Pixel Attention, Channel Attention, and Spatial Attention for feature enrichment. Second, addressing the challenge of information loss incurred during attention mechanism transitions and feature fusion, we design a Feature Fusion Modulator. This module bolsters the integration between the channel and spatial attention by mitigating reshaping-induced information attrition. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on various medical image segmentation tasks, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.

In this work, we expose a critical vulnerability of VLMs when exposed to subtle, structured perturbations in the frequency domain. Specifically, we highlight how these feature transformations undermine authenticity/DeepFake detection and automated image captioning tasks. We design targeted image transformations, operating in the frequency domain to systematically adjust VLM outputs when exposed to frequency-perturbed real and synthetic images. We demonstrate that the perturbation injection method generalizes across five state-of-the-art VLMs which includes different-parameter Qwen2/2.5 and BLIP models. Experimenting across ten real and generated image datasets reveals that VLM judgments are sensitive to frequency-based cues and may not wholly align with semantic content. Crucially, we show that visually-imperceptible spatial frequency transformations expose the fragility of VLMs deployed for automated image captioning and authenticity detection tasks. Our findings under realistic, black-box constraints challenge the reliability of VLMs, underscoring the need for robust multimodal perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Frequency-Domain Perturbations, Adversarial Robustness, Image Authenticity, Reliability</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse. In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures, which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table Code available at: https://github.com/fekoester/Shakespeare_Res</p></details> |

RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like $\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement as key factors.

However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy. Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco, and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.</p></details> | 13 pages |

To derive the asymptotics of our test statistic, we prove a fundamental LLN-type result for a class of stable but nonstationary autoregressive processes, using a novel dual linear process approximation. We show that our modified test yields correct inferences regarding the number of common trends in such a system, whereas the unmodified test tends to infer a higher number of common trends than are actually present, when cointegrating relations are nonlinear.</p></details> | ii + 38 pp |

However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants).

| **[ReverBERT: A State Space Model for Efficient Text-Driven Speech Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20992v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven speech style transfer aims to mold the intonation, pace, and timbre of a spoken utterance to match stylistic cues from text descriptions. While existing methods leverage large-scale neural architectures or pre-trained language models, the computational costs often remain high. In this paper, we present \emph{ReverBERT}, an efficient framework for text-driven speech style transfer that draws inspiration from a state space model (SSM) paradigm, loosely motivated by the image-based method of Wang and Liu~\cite{wang2024stylemamba}. Unlike image domain techniques, our method operates in the speech space and integrates a discrete Fourier transform of latent speech features to enable smooth and continuous style modulation. We also propose a novel \emph{Transformer-based SSM} layer for bridging textual style descriptors with acoustic attributes, dramatically reducing inference time while preserving high-quality speech characteristics. Extensive experiments on benchmark speech corpora demonstrate that \emph{ReverBERT} significantly outperforms baselines in terms of naturalness, expressiveness, and computational efficiency. We release our model and code publicly to foster further research in text-driven speech style transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship and affiliation</p></details> |

However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs. See https://github.com/MilkThink-Lab/MiniLongBench for our code, data and tutorial.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL'25 main track</p></details> |

Instead of reconstructing the entire scene holistically, DepR generates individual objects and subsequently composes them into a coherent 3D layout. Unlike previous methods that use depth solely for object layout estimation during inference and therefore fail to fully exploit its rich geometric information, DepR leverages depth throughout both training and inference. Specifically, we introduce depth-guided conditioning to effectively encode shape priors into diffusion models. During inference, depth further guides DDIM sampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the reconstruction and the input image. Despite being trained on limited synthetic data, DepR achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization in single-view scene reconstruction, as shown through evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Kan Approximations of the Persistent Homology Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22816v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The persistent homology transform (PHT) of a subset $M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a map $\text{PHT}(M):\mathbb{S}^{d-1} \to \mathbf{Dgm}$ from the unit sphere to the space of persistence diagrams. This map assigns to each direction $v\in \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ the persistent homology of the filtration of $M$ in direction $v$. In practice, one can only sample the map $\text{PHT}(M)$ at a finite set of directions $A \subset \mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. This suggests two natural questions: (1) Can we interpolate the PHT from this finite sample of directions to the entire sphere? If so, (2) can we prove that the resulting interpolation is close to the true PHT? In this paper we show that if we can sample the PHT at the module level, where we have information about how homology from each direction interacts, a ready-made interpolation theory due to Bubenik, de Silva, and Nanda using Kan extensions can answer both of these questions in the affirmative. A close inspection of those techniques shows that we can infer the PHT from a finite sample of heights from each direction as well. Our paper presents the first known results for approximating the PHT from finite directional and scalar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures.

| **[RocketStack: Level-aware deep recursive ensemble learning framework with adaptive feature fusion and model pruning dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16965v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensemble learning remains a cornerstone of machine learning, with stacking used to integrate predictions from multiple base learners through a meta-model. However, deep stacking remains rare, as most designs prioritize horizontal diversity over recursive depth due to model complexity, feature redundancy, and computational burden. To address these challenges, RocketStack, a level-aware recursive ensemble framework, is introduced and explored up to ten stacking levels, extending beyond prior architectures. The framework incrementally prunes weaker learners at each level, enabling deeper stacking without excessive complexity. To mitigate early performance saturation, mild Gaussian noise is added to out-of-fold (OOF) scores before pruning, and compared against strict OOF pruning. Further both per-level and periodic feature compressions are explored using attention-based selection, Simple, Fast, Efficient (SFE) filter, and autoencoders. Across 33 datasets (23 binary, 10 multi-class), linear-trend tests confirmed rising accuracy with depth in most variants, and the top performing meta-model at each level increasingly outperformed the strongest standalone ensemble. In the binary subset, periodic SFE with mild OOF-score randomization reached 97.08% at level 10, 5.14% above the strict-pruning configuration and cut runtime by 10.5% relative to no compression. In the multi-class subset, periodic attention selection reached 98.60% at level 10, exceeding the strongest baseline by 6.11%, while reducing runtime by 56.1% and feature dimensionality by 74% compared to no compression. These findings highlight mild randomization as an effective regularizer and periodic compression as a stabilizer. Echoing the design of multistage rockets in aerospace (prune, compress, propel) RocketStack achieves deep recursive ensembling with tractable complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 1 graphical abstract, 7 figures, 9 tables, 2 supplementary figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Ultra-Low-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models Through Saliency-Aware Partial Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13932v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of large language models has raised environmental and economic concerns about their intensity of resource usage during inference. Serving these models to each user requires substantial energy and water for cooling. Model compression techniques like quantization can shrink large language models and make them more resource efficient at the cost of potential performance degradation. Quantization methods compress model size through replacing their high-precision parameters by quantized values of lower precision. Among existing methods, the ApiQ method achieves superior accuracy preservation at minimal memory and time overhead. We investigate two ideas to extend performance in ultra-low-bit quantization beyond ApiQ's level. First, we look into combining existing quantization-aware training techniques with ApiQ's partial training. We show that this does not outperform the baseline ApiQ method with limited training data and frozen weights. This leads to two key insights: (1) The substantial representational capacity that is gained through full retraining is unlikely to be feasible through partial training. (2) This gain may depend on using a large and diverse dataset in quantization-aware training. Second, through a novel approach informed by the two insights, we propose an ultra-low-bit quantization method that builds upon ApiQ and extends its performance without the need for full retraining. This publicly available method relies on a saliency-aware regularization term that prioritizes preserving the most impactful parameters during quantization. Our experiments on LLaMA 7B and 13B benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces the ApiQ's accuracy degradation by 10.85% and 7.54% respectively. A Python implementation of the proposed quantization method is publicly available on GitHub https://github.com/TokuyuSou/ULB-SAPR.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a post-peer-review accepted manuscript from the proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI'25).

| **[Controllable joint noise reduction and hearing loss compensation using a differentiable auditory model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09372v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based hearing loss compensation (HLC) seeks to enhance speech intelligibility and quality for hearing impaired listeners using neural networks. One major challenge of HLC is the lack of a ground-truth target. Recent works have used neural networks to emulate non-differentiable auditory peripheral models in closed-loop frameworks, but this approach lacks flexibility. Alternatively, differentiable auditory models allow direct optimization, yet previous studies focused on individual listener profiles, or joint noise reduction (NR) and HLC without balancing each task. This work formulates NR and HLC as a multi-task learning problem, training a system to simultaneously predict denoised and compensated signals from noisy speech and audiograms using a differentiable auditory model. Results show the system achieves similar objective metric performance to systems trained for each task separately, while being able to adjust the balance between NR and HLC during inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Clarity 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

While diffusion-based models produce high-quality images, their extensive denoising steps result in significant computational overhead, limiting real-world applicability. Visual autoregressive (VAR) models, which predict next-scale tokens rather than spatially adjacent ones, offer significantly faster inference suitable for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose the first VAR-based approach for subject-driven generation. However, naive fine-tuning VAR leads to computational overhead, language drift, and reduced diversity. To address these challenges, we introduce selective layer tuning to reduce complexity and prior distillation to mitigate language drift. Additionally, we found that the early stages have a greater influence on the generation of subject than the latter stages, which merely synthesize minor details. Based on this finding, we propose scale-wise weighted tuning, which prioritizes coarser resolutions for promoting the model to focus on the subject-relevant information instead of local details. Extensive experiments validate that our method significantly outperforms diffusion-based baselines across various metrics and demonstrates its practical usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[Subtyping Breast Lesions via Generative Augmentation based Long-tailed Recognition in Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22568v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate identification of breast lesion subtypes can facilitate personalized treatment and interventions. Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging modality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and diagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed long-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated recognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify data distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for long-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through high-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic performance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven adaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by training a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data while ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our class-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception branch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features while enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house long-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our method achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

The motion direction angle affects the micro-Doppler spectrum width, thus determining the human motion direction can provide important prior information for downstream tasks such as gait recognition. However, Doppler-Time map (DTM)-based methods still have room for improvement in achieving feature augmentation and motion determination simultaneously. In response, a low-cost but accurate radar-based human motion direction determination (HMDD) method is explored in this paper. In detail, the radar-based human gait DTMs are first generated, and then the feature augmentation is achieved using feature linking model. Subsequently, the HMDD is implemented through a lightweight and fast Vision Transformer-Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through open-source dataset.

Despite these advancements, existing reasoning LLMs often generate unnecessarily lengthy reasoning processes, leading to significant computational overhead and response latency. These limitations hinder their practical deployment in real-world clinical environments. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{ControlMed}, a medical language model that enables users to actively control the length of the reasoning process at inference time through fine-grained control markers. ControlMed is trained through a three-stage pipeline: 1) pre-training on a large-scale synthetic medical instruction dataset covering both \textit{direct} and \textit{reasoning responses}; 2) supervised fine-tuning with multi-length reasoning data and explicit length-control markers; and 3) reinforcement learning with model-based reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and response quality. Experimental results on a variety of English and Korean medical benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves similar or better performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, users can flexibly balance reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency by controlling the reasoning length as needed. These findings demonstrate that ControlMed is a practical and adaptable solution for clinical question answering and medical information analysis.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It allows verification of model identity by both the rightful owner and third party without presenting the original model. We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the identification of DNN models using adversarial attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

Each human part, such as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions. In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction.

However, neither restriction may be supported by economic theory in some empirical contexts, leading to severe bias and misleading inference. The clustering-based grouped parameter estimator (GPE) introduced in this paper drops both restrictions and maintains the natural one that the parameter support be bounded. GPE exhibits robust large sample properties under standard conditions and accommodates both sparse and non-sparse parameters whose support can be bounded away from zero. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the excellent performance of GPE in terms of bias reduction and size control compared to competing estimators. An empirical application of GPE to estimating price and income elasticities of demand for gasoline highlights its practical utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First draft: June 2019.

In contrast, small language models (SLMs) ranging from 0.5B to 1.5B parameters currently underperform on Text-to-SQL tasks due to their limited logical reasoning capabilities. However, SLMs offer inherent advantages in inference speed and suitability for edge deployment. To explore their potential in Text-to-SQL applications, we leverage recent advancements in post-training techniques. Specifically, we used the open-source SynSQL-2.5M dataset to construct two derived datasets: SynSQL-Think-916K for SQL generation and SynSQL-Merge-Think-310K for SQL merge revision. We then applied supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based post-training to the SLM, followed by inference using a corrective self-consistency approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, SLM-SQL. On the BIRD development set, the five evaluated models achieved an average improvement of 31.4 points. Notably, the 0.5B model reached 56.87\% execution accuracy (EX), while the 1.5B model achieved 67.08\% EX.

It has an $n$-dimensional merit parameter $\bs{\beta}$ and a fixed-dimensional regression coefficient $\bs{\gamma}$ for covariates. When the number of subjects $n$ approaches infinity and the number of comparisons between any two subjects is fixed, we show the uniform consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) $(\widehat{\bs{\beta}}, \widehat{\bs{\gamma}})$ of $(\bs{\beta}, \bs{\gamma})$ Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic normal distribution of the MLE by characterizing its asymptotic representation. The asymptotic distribution of $\widehat{\bs{\gamma}}$ is biased, while that of $\widehat{\bs{\beta}}$ is not. This phenomenon can be attributed to the different convergence rates of $\widehat{\bs{\gamma}}$ and $\widehat{\bs{\beta}}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the asymptotic theory in paired comparison models with covariates in a high-dimensional setting. The consistency result is further extended to an Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi comparison graph with a diverging number of covariates. Numerical studies and a real data analysis demonstrate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | 58 pages, 1 figure |

However, existing methods commonly struggle to capture geometric realism and global topological consistency. Recent LiDAR Diffusion Models (LiDMs) predominantly embed LiDAR points into the latent space for improved generation efficiency, which limits their interpretable ability to model detailed geometric structures and preserve global topological consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TopoLiDM, a novel framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with diffusion models under topological regularization for high-fidelity LiDAR generation. Our approach first trains a topological-preserving VAE to extract latent graph representations by graph construction and multiple graph convolutional layers. Then we freeze the VAE and generate novel latent topological graphs through the latent diffusion models. We also introduce 0-dimensional persistent homology (PH) constraints, ensuring the generated LiDAR scenes adhere to real-world global topological structures. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate TopoLiDM's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 22.6% lower Frechet Range Image Distance (FRID) and 9.2% lower Minimum Matching Distance (MMD). Notably, our model also enables fast generation speed with an average inference time of 1.68 samples/s, showcasing its scalability for real-world applications.

To this end, we propose an asynchronous distributed algorithm, named Asynchronous Single-looP alternatIve gRadient projEction (ASPIRE) algorithm with the itErative Active SEt method (EASE) to tackle the federated distributionally robust optimization (FDRO) problem. Furthermore, a new uncertainty set, i.e., constrained D-norm uncertainty set, is developed to effectively leverage the prior distribution and flexibly control the degree of robustness. Finally, our theoretical analysis elucidates that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge and the iteration complexity is also analyzed. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can not only achieve fast convergence, and remain robust against data heterogeneity as well as malicious attacks, but also tradeoff robustness with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2210.07588</p></details> |

Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse. In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures, which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table Code available at: https://github.com/fekoester/Shakespeare_Res</p></details> |

Analyzing such data introduces spatial dependence among health outcomes and seeks to report statistically significant spatial disparities by delineating boundaries that separate neighboring regions with disparate health outcomes. However, there are statistical challenges to appropriately define what constitutes a spatial disparity and to construct robust probabilistic inferences for spatial disparities. We enrich the familiar Bayesian linear regression framework to introduce spatial autoregression and offer model-based detection of spatial disparities. We derive exploitable analytical tractability that considerably accelerates computation. Simulation experiments conducted on a county map of the entire United States demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and we apply our method to a data set from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on age-standardized US county-level estimates of lung cancer mortality rates.</p></details> | 47 pages, 5 figures |

However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

| **[Minimum Attention Control (MAC) in a Receding Horizon Framework with Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20835v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Minimum Attention Control (MAC) is a control technique that provides minimal input changes to meet the control objective. Mathematically, the zero norm of the input changes is used as a constraint for the given control objective and minimized with respect to the process dynamics. In this paper, along with the zero norm constraint, stage costs are also considered for reference tracking in a receding horizon framework. For this purpose, the optimal inputs of the previous horizons are also considered in the optimization problem of the current horizon. An alternating minimization algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem (Minimum Attention Model Predictive Control (MAMPC)). The outer step of the optimization is a quadratic program, while the inner step, which solves for sparsity, has an analytical solution. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two case studies: a four-tank system with slow dynamics and a fuel cell stack with fast dynamics. A detailed comparative study of the proposed algorithm with standard MPC indicates sparse control actions with a tradeoff in the tracking error.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Multimodal LLMs as Customized Reward Models for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21391v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with later-layer hidden representations. In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives: text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

| **[SteerX: Creating Any Camera-Free 3D and 4D Scenes with Geometric Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12024v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in 3D/4D scene generation emphasizes the importance of physical alignment throughout video generation and scene reconstruction. However, existing methods improve the alignment separately at each stage, making it difficult to manage subtle misalignments arising from another stage. Here, we present SteerX, a zero-shot inference-time steering method that unifies scene reconstruction into the generation process, tilting data distributions toward better geometric alignment. To this end, we introduce two geometric reward functions for 3D/4D scene generation by using pose-free feed-forward scene reconstruction models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SteerX in improving 3D/4D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://byeongjun-park.github.io/SteerX/</p></details> |

Traditional methods rely on computationally intensive iterative optimization in a complex chain, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Recent advances in feed-forward approaches, driven by deep learning, have revolutionized this field by enabling fast and generalizable 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. This survey offers a comprehensive review of feed-forward techniques for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation architectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics, and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance the state of the art in 3D vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pro...</summary><p>A project page associated with this survey is available at https://fnzhan.com/projects/Feed-Forward-3D</p></details> |
| **[Parametrized Multi-Agent Routing via Deep Attention Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22338v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a scalable deep learning framework for parametrized sequential decision-making (ParaSDM), where multiple agents jointly optimize discrete action policies and shared continuous parameters. A key subclass of this setting arises in Facility-Location and Path Optimization (FLPO), where multi-agent systems must simultaneously determine optimal routes and facility locations, aiming to minimize the cumulative transportation cost within the network. FLPO problems are NP-hard due to their mixed discrete-continuous structure and highly non-convex objective. To address this, we integrate the Maximum Entropy Principle (MEP) with a neural policy model called the Shortest Path Network (SPN)-a permutation-invariant encoder-decoder that approximates the MEP solution while enabling efficient gradient-based optimization over shared parameters. The SPN achieves up to 100$\times$ speedup in policy inference and gradient computation compared to MEP baselines, with an average optimality gap of approximately 6% across a wide range of problem sizes. Our FLPO approach yields over 10$\times$ lower cost than metaheuristic baselines while running significantly faster, and matches Gurobi's optimal cost with annealing at a 1500$\times$ speedup-establishing a new state of the art for ParaSDM problems. These results highlight the power of structured deep models for solving large-scale mixed-integer optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is under submission to AAAI 2026.

| **[TrajLens: Visual Analysis for Constructing Cell Developmental Trajectories in Cross-Sample Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15620v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing cell developmental trajectories is a critical task in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, enabling the inference of potential cellular progression paths. However, current automated methods are limited to establishing cell developmental trajectories within individual samples, necessitating biologists to manually link cells across samples to construct complete cross-sample evolutionary trajectories that consider cellular spatial dynamics. This process demands substantial human effort due to the complex spatial correspondence between each pair of samples. To address this challenge, we first proposed a GNN-based model to predict cross-sample cell developmental trajectories. We then developed TrajLens, a visual analytics system that supports biologists in exploring and refining the cell developmental trajectories based on predicted links. Specifically, we designed the visualization that integrates features on cell distribution and developmental direction across multiple samples, providing an overview of the spatial evolutionary patterns of cell populations along trajectories. Additionally, we included contour maps superimposed on the original cell distribution data, enabling biologists to explore them intuitively. To demonstrate our system's performance, we conducted quantitative evaluations of our model with two case studies and expert interviews to validate its usefulness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by IEEE VIS'25</p></details> |
| **[FloPE: Flower Pose Estimation for Precision Pollination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11692v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents Flower Pose Estimation (FloPE), a real-time flower pose estimation framework for computationally constrained robotic pollination systems. Robotic pollination has been proposed to supplement natural pollination to ensure global food security due to the decreased population of natural pollinators. However, flower pose estimation for pollination is challenging due to natural variability, flower clusters, and high accuracy demands due to the flowers' fragility when pollinating. This method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate photorealistic synthetic datasets with precise pose annotations, enabling effective knowledge distillation from a high-capacity teacher model to a lightweight student model for efficient inference. The approach was evaluated on both single and multi-arm robotic platforms, achieving a mean pose estimation error of 0.6 cm and 19.14 degrees within a low computational cost. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of FloPE, achieving up to 78.75% pollination success rate and outperforming prior robotic pollination techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025.

| **[TurboReg: TurboClique for Robust and Efficient Point Cloud Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01439v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$ scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset, TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving higher recall. Our code is accessible at \href{https://github.com/Laka-3DV/TurboReg}{\texttt{TurboReg}}.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV-...</summary><p>ICCV-2025 Accepted Paper</p></details> |

While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-ray images, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/eigenvivek/polypose</p></details> |
| **[When Tokens Talk Too Much: A Survey of Multimodal Long-Context Token Compression across Images, Videos, and Audios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20198v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides, largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression. Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1) image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data; (2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based, and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update the latest advances in this promising area.</p></details> | <details><summary>For o...</summary><p>For ongoing updates and to track the latest advances in this promising area, we maintain a public repository: https://github.com/cokeshao/Awesome-Multimodal-Token-Compression</p></details> |
| **[SKiD-SLAM: Robust, Lightweight, and Distributed Multi-Robot LiDAR SLAM in Resource-Constrained Field Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08230v3)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed LiDAR SLAM is crucial for achieving efficient robot autonomy and improving the scalability of mapping. However, two issues need to be considered when applying it in field environments: one is resource limitation, and the other is inter/intra-robot association. The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM. Through various environmental experiments, we demonstrate that our method is more robust and lightweight compared to other state-of-the-art distributed SLAM approaches, overcoming resource limitation and inter/intra-robot association issues. Also, we validated the field applicability of our approach through mapping experiments in real-world planetary emulation terrain and cave environments, which are in-house datasets. Our code will be available at https://sparolab.github.io/research/skid_slam/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |
| **[An Introduction to Modern Statistical Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10185v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work in progress aims to provide a unified introduction to statistical learning, building up slowly from classical models like the GMM and HMM to modern neural networks like the VAE and diffusion models. There are today many internet resources that explain this or that new machine-learning algorithm in isolation, but they do not (and cannot, in so brief a space) connect these algorithms with each other or with the classical literature on statistical models, out of which the modern algorithms emerged. Also conspicuously lacking is a single notational system which, although unfazing to those already familiar with the material (like the authors of these posts), raises a significant barrier to the novice's entry. Likewise, I have aimed to assimilate the various models, wherever possible, to a single framework for inference and learning, showing how (and why) to change one model into another with minimal alteration (some of them novel, others from the literature). Some background is of course necessary. I have assumed the reader is familiar with basic multivariable calculus, probability and statistics, and linear algebra. The goal of this book is certainly not completeness, but rather to draw a more or less straight-line path from the basics to the extremely powerful new models of the last decade. The goal then is to complement, not replace, such comprehensive texts as Bishop's \emph{Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning}, which is now 15 years old.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript draft, v. 2.0; 199 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |
| **[Weighted Conditional Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22270v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional flow matching (CFM) has emerged as a powerful framework for training continuous normalizing flows due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness. However, standard CFM often produces paths that deviate significantly from straight-line interpolations between prior and target distributions, making generation slower and less accurate due to the need for fine discretization at inference. Recent methods enhance CFM performance by inducing shorter and straighter trajectories but typically rely on computationally expensive mini-batch optimal transport (OT). Drawing insights from entropic optimal transport (EOT), we propose Weighted Conditional Flow Matching (W-CFM), a novel approach that modifies the classical CFM loss by weighting each training pair $(x, y)$ with a Gibbs kernel. We show that this weighting recovers the entropic OT coupling up to some bias in the marginals, and we provide the conditions under which the marginals remain nearly unchanged. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between W-CFM and the minibatch OT method in the large-batch limit, showing how our method overcomes computational and performance bottlenecks linked to batch size. Empirically, we test our method on unconditional generation on various synthetic and real datasets, confirming that W-CFM achieves comparable or superior sample quality, fidelity, and diversity to other alternative baselines while maintaining the computational efficiency of vanilla CFM.</p></details> | Working paper |

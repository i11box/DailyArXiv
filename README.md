| **[Generalized Contrastive Divergence: Joint Training of Energy-Based Model and Diffusion Model through Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03397v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Generalized Contrastive Divergence (GCD), a novel objective function for training an energy-based model (EBM) and a sampler simultaneously. GCD generalizes Contrastive Divergence (Hinton, 2002), a celebrated algorithm for training EBM, by replacing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) distribution with a trainable sampler, such as a diffusion model. In GCD, the joint training of EBM and a diffusion model is formulated as a minimax problem, which reaches an equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The minimax learning with GCD bears interesting equivalence to inverse reinforcement learning, where the energy corresponds to a negative reward, the diffusion model is a policy, and the real data is expert demonstrations. We present preliminary yet promising results showing that joint training is beneficial for both EBM and a diffusion model. GCD enables EBM training without MCMC while improving the sample quality of a diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 Workshop on Diffusion Models</p></details> |
| **[Fixed Point Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08741v1)** | 2024-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Fixed Point Diffusion Model (FPDM), a novel approach to image generation that integrates the concept of fixed point solving into the framework of diffusion-based generative modeling. Our approach embeds an implicit fixed point solving layer into the denoising network of a diffusion model, transforming the diffusion process into a sequence of closely-related fixed point problems. Combined with a new stochastic training method, this approach significantly reduces model size, reduces memory usage, and accelerates training. Moreover, it enables the development of two new techniques to improve sampling efficiency: reallocating computation across timesteps and reusing fixed point solutions between timesteps. We conduct extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models on ImageNet, FFHQ, CelebA-HQ, and LSUN-Church, demonstrating substantial improvements in performance and efficiency. Compared to the state-of-the-art DiT model, FPDM contains 87% fewer parameters, consumes 60% less memory during training, and improves image generation quality in situations where sampling computation or time is limited. Our code and pretrained models are available at https://lukemelas.github.io/fixed-point-diffusion-models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lukemelas.github.io/fixed-point-diffusion-models</p></details> |
| **[Controllable Generation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04279v1)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rapidly advancing realm of visual generation, diffusion models have revolutionized the landscape, marking a significant shift in capabilities with their impressive text-guided generative functions. However, relying solely on text for conditioning these models does not fully cater to the varied and complex requirements of different applications and scenarios. Acknowledging this shortfall, a variety of studies aim to control pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to support novel conditions. In this survey, we undertake a thorough review of the literature on controllable generation with T2I diffusion models, covering both the theoretical foundations and practical advancements in this domain. Our review begins with a brief introduction to the basics of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and widely used T2I diffusion models. We then reveal the controlling mechanisms of diffusion models, theoretically analyzing how novel conditions are introduced into the denoising process for conditional generation. Additionally, we offer a detailed overview of research in this area, organizing it into distinct categories from the condition perspective: generation with specific conditions, generation with multiple conditions, and universal controllable generation.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the critical components of diffusion models for video generation, including their applications, architectural design, and temporal dynamics modeling. The paper begins by discussing the core principles and mathematical formulations, then explores various architectural choices and methods for maintaining temporal consistency.

However, as far as we know, the generation of depth maps jointly with RGB is still limited. We introduce LDM3D-VR, a suite of diffusion models targeting virtual reality development that includes LDM3D-pano and LDM3D-SR. These models enable the generation of panoramic RGBD based on textual prompts and the upscaling of low-resolution inputs to high-resolution RGBD, respectively.

Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-costly and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Denoi...</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models, Inverse Problems, Generative Models, Super Resolution, Phase Quantification, Variational Methods</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Attribute Variations in Style-based GANs using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16052v1)** | 2023-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing attribute editing methods treat semantic attributes as binary, resulting in a single edit per attribute. However, attributes such as eyeglasses, smiles, or hairstyles exhibit a vast range of diversity. In this work, we formulate the task of \textit{diverse attribute editing} by modeling the multidimensional nature of attribute edits. This enables users to generate multiple plausible edits per attribute. We capitalize on disentangled latent spaces of pretrained GANs and train a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to learn the latent distribution for diverse edits. Specifically, we train DDPM over a dataset of edit latent directions obtained by embedding image pairs with a single attribute change. This leads to latent subspaces that enable diverse attribute editing. Applying diffusion in the highly compressed latent space allows us to model rich distributions of edits within limited computational resources. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across a range of datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for diverse attribute editing. We also showcase the results of our method applied for 3D editing of various face attributes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips Workshop on Diffusion Models 2023</p></details> |
| **[Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Certifiably Robust Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02316v4)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative learning, recognized for its effective modeling of data distributions, offers inherent advantages in handling out-of-distribution instances, especially for enhancing robustness to adversarial attacks. Among these, diffusion classifiers, utilizing powerful diffusion models, have demonstrated superior empirical robustness. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of their robustness is still lacking, raising concerns about their vulnerability to stronger future attacks. In this study, we prove that diffusion classifiers possess $O(1)$ Lipschitzness, and establish their certified robustness, demonstrating their inherent resilience. To achieve non-constant Lipschitzness, thereby obtaining much tighter certified robustness, we generalize diffusion classifiers to classify Gaussian-corrupted data. This involves deriving the evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) for these distributions, approximating the likelihood using the ELBO, and calculating classification probabilities via Bayes' theorem. Experimental results show the superior certified robustness of these Noised Diffusion Classifiers (NDCs). Notably, we achieve over 80% and 70% certified robustness on CIFAR-10 under adversarial perturbations with \(\ell_2\) norms less than 0.25 and 0.5, respectively, using a single off-the-shelf diffusion model without any additional data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Alignment of Diffusion Models: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Future](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07253v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as the leading paradigm in generative modeling, excelling in various applications. Despite their success, these models often misalign with human intentions and generate results with undesired properties or even harmful content. Inspired by the success and popularity of alignment in tuning large language models, recent studies have investigated aligning diffusion models with human expectations and preferences. This work mainly reviews alignment of text-to-image diffusion models, covering advancements in fundamentals of alignment, alignment techniques of diffusion models, preference benchmarks, and evaluation for diffusion models. Moreover, we discuss key perspectives on current challenges and promising future directions on solving the remaining challenges in alignment of diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive review paper for researchers and engineers to comprehend, practice, and research alignment of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, Paper List: github.com/xie-lab-ml/awesome-alignment-of-diffusion-models</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Controllability of Diffusion Models via Feature Disentanglement and Realism-Enhanced Sampling Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14368v5)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Diffusion Models have shown promising performance, a lot of efforts have been made to improve the controllability of Diffusion Models. However, how to train Diffusion Models to have the disentangled latent spaces and how to naturally incorporate the disentangled conditions during the sampling process have been underexplored. In this paper, we present a training framework for feature disentanglement of Diffusion Models (FDiff). We further propose two sampling methods that can boost the realism of our Diffusion Models and also enhance the controllability. Concisely, we train Diffusion Models conditioned on two latent features, a spatial content mask, and a flattened style embedding. We rely on the inductive bias of the denoising process of Diffusion Models to encode pose/layout information in the content feature and semantic/style information in the style feature. Regarding the sampling methods, we first generalize Composable Diffusion Models (GCDM) by breaking the conditional independence assumption to allow for some dependence between conditional inputs, which is shown to be effective in realistic generation in our experiments. Second, we propose timestep-dependent weight scheduling for content and style features to further improve the performance. We also observe better controllability of our proposed methods compared to existing methods in image manipulation and image translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024; Code is available at https://github.com/WonwoongCho/Towards-Enhanced-Controllability-of-Diffusion-Models</p></details> |
| **[Towards Fast Stochastic Sampling in Diffusion Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07211v2)** | 2024-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models suffer from slow sample generation at inference time. Despite recent efforts, improving the sampling efficiency of stochastic samplers for diffusion models remains a promising direction. We propose Splitting Integrators for fast stochastic sampling in pre-trained diffusion models in augmented spaces. Commonly used in molecular dynamics, splitting-based integrators attempt to improve sampling efficiency by cleverly alternating between numerical updates involving the data, auxiliary, or noise variables. However, we show that a naive application of splitting integrators is sub-optimal for fast sampling. Consequently, we propose several principled modifications to naive splitting samplers for improving sampling efficiency and denote the resulting samplers as Reduced Splitting Integrators. In the context of Phase Space Langevin Diffusion (PSLD) [Pandey \& Mandt, 2023] on CIFAR-10, our stochastic sampler achieves an FID score of 2.36 in only 100 network function evaluations (NFE) as compared to 2.63 for the best baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the NeurIPS'23 Workshop on Diffusion Models.

| **[Prompt-Free Diffusion: Taking "Text" out of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.16223v2)** | 2023-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) research has grown explosively in the past year, owing to the large-scale pre-trained diffusion models and many emerging personalization and editing approaches. Yet, one pain point persists: the text prompt engineering, and searching high-quality text prompts for customized results is more art than science. Moreover, as commonly argued: "an image is worth a thousand words" - the attempt to describe a desired image with texts often ends up being ambiguous and cannot comprehensively cover delicate visual details, hence necessitating more additional controls from the visual domain. In this paper, we take a bold step forward: taking "Text" out of a pre-trained T2I diffusion model, to reduce the burdensome prompt engineering efforts for users. Our proposed framework, Prompt-Free Diffusion, relies on only visual inputs to generate new images: it takes a reference image as "context", an optional image structural conditioning, and an initial noise, with absolutely no text prompt. The core architecture behind the scene is Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder), substituting the commonly used CLIP-based or LLM-based text encoder. The reusability of SeeCoder also makes it a convenient drop-in component: one can also pre-train a SeeCoder in one T2I model and reuse it for another. Through extensive experiments, Prompt-Free Diffusion is experimentally found to (i) outperform prior exemplar-based image synthesis approaches; (ii) perform on par with state-of-the-art T2I models using prompts following the best practice; and (iii) be naturally extensible to other downstream applications such as anime figure generation and virtual try-on, with promising quality.

| **[Diffusion Models Generate Images Like Painters: an Analytical Theory of Outline First, Details Later](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02490v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do diffusion generative models convert pure noise into meaningful images? In a variety of pretrained diffusion models (including conditional latent space models like Stable Diffusion), we observe that the reverse diffusion process that underlies image generation has the following properties: (i) individual trajectories tend to be low-dimensional and resemble 2D `rotations'; (ii) high-variance scene features like layout tend to emerge earlier, while low-variance details tend to emerge later; and (iii) early perturbations tend to have a greater impact on image content than later perturbations. To understand these phenomena, we derive and study a closed-form solution to the probability flow ODE for a Gaussian distribution, which shows that the reverse diffusion state rotates towards a gradually-specified target on the image manifold. It also shows that generation involves first committing to an outline, and then to finer and finer details. We find that this solution accurately describes the initial phase of image generation for pretrained models, and can in principle be used to make image generation more efficient by skipping reverse diffusion steps. Finally, we use our solution to characterize the image manifold in Stable Diffusion. Our viewpoint reveals an unexpected similarity between generation by GANs and diffusion and provides a conceptual link between diffusion and image retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 28 figures.

| **[Compositional Visual Generation with Composable Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01714v6)** | 2023-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large text-guided diffusion models, such as DALLE-2, are able to generate stunning photorealistic images given natural language descriptions. While such models are highly flexible, they struggle to understand the composition of certain concepts, such as confusing the attributes of different objects or relations between objects. In this paper, we propose an alternative structured approach for compositional generation using diffusion models. An image is generated by composing a set of diffusion models, with each of them modeling a certain component of the image. To do this, we interpret diffusion models as energy-based models in which the data distributions defined by the energy functions may be explicitly combined. The proposed method can generate scenes at test time that are substantially more complex than those seen in training, composing sentence descriptions, object relations, human facial attributes, and even generalizing to new combinations that are rarely seen in the real world. We further illustrate how our approach may be used to compose pre-trained text-guided diffusion models and generate photorealistic images containing all the details described in the input descriptions, including the binding of certain object attributes that have been shown difficult for DALLE-2. These results point to the effectiveness of the proposed method in promoting structured generalization for visual generation.

Utilizing the recent developments in diffusion models, we introduce diffusion-based causal models (DCM) to learn causal mechanisms, that generate unique latent encodings. These encodings enable us to directly sample under interventions and perform abduction for counterfactuals. Diffusion models are a natural fit here, since they can encode each node to a latent representation that acts as a proxy for exogenous noise. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods for answering causal queries. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results that offer a methodology for analyzing counterfactual estimation in general encoder-decoder models, which could be useful in settings beyond our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages.

| **[Adversarial Diffusion Attacks on Graph-based Traffic Prediction Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09369v1)** | 2021-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time traffic prediction models play a pivotal role in smart mobility systems and have been widely used in route guidance, emerging mobility services, and advanced traffic management systems. With the availability of massive traffic data, neural network-based deep learning methods, especially the graph convolutional networks (GCN) have demonstrated outstanding performance in mining spatio-temporal information and achieving high prediction accuracy. Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of GCN under adversarial attacks, while there is a lack of studies to understand the vulnerability issues of the GCN-based traffic prediction models. Given this, this paper proposes a new task -- diffusion attack, to study the robustness of GCN-based traffic prediction models. The diffusion attack aims to select and attack a small set of nodes to degrade the performance of the entire prediction model. To conduct the diffusion attack, we propose a novel attack algorithm, which consists of two major components: 1) approximating the gradient of the black-box prediction model with Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA); 2) adapting the knapsack greedy algorithm to select the attack nodes. The proposed algorithm is examined with three GCN-based traffic prediction models: St-Gcn, T-Gcn, and A3t-Gcn on two cities. The proposed algorithm demonstrates high efficiency in the adversarial attack tasks under various scenarios, and it can still generate adversarial samples under the drop regularization such as DropOut, DropNode, and DropEdge. The research outcomes could help to improve the robustness of the GCN-based traffic prediction models and better protect the smart mobility systems.

While some demands can be easily hand-designed, e.g., the smoothness of a trajectory, several task-specific objectives need to be learned from data. This work introduces a method for learning data-driven SE(3) cost functions as diffusion models. Diffusion models can represent highly-expressive multimodal distributions and exhibit proper gradients over the entire space due to their score-matching training objective. Learning costs as diffusion models allows their seamless integration with other costs into a single differentiable objective function, enabling joint gradient-based motion optimization. In this work, we focus on learning SE(3) diffusion models for 6DoF grasping, giving rise to a novel framework for joint grasp and motion optimization without needing to decouple grasp selection from trajectory generation. We evaluate the representation power of our SE(3) diffusion models w.r.t. classical generative models, and we showcase the superior performance of our proposed optimization framework in a series of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks against representative baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>diffu...</summary><p>diffusion models, SE(3), grasping,</p></details> |

However, they inevitably memorize training images or videos, subsequently replicating their concepts, content, or styles during inference. This phenomenon raises significant concerns about privacy, security, and copyright within generated outputs. In this survey, we provide the first comprehensive review of replication in visual diffusion models, marking a novel contribution to the field by systematically categorizing the existing studies into unveiling, understanding, and mitigating this phenomenon. Specifically, unveiling mainly refers to the methods used to detect replication instances. Understanding involves analyzing the underlying mechanisms and factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Mitigation focuses on developing strategies to reduce or eliminate replication. Beyond these aspects, we also review papers focusing on its real-world influence. For instance, in the context of healthcare, replication is critically worrying due to privacy concerns related to patient data. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the ongoing challenges, such as the difficulty in detecting and benchmarking replication, and outlines future directions including the development of more robust mitigation techniques. By synthesizing insights from diverse studies, this paper aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a deeper understanding at the intersection between AI technology and social good.

| **[Smooth Diffusion: Crafting Smooth Latent Spaces in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.04410v1)** | 2023-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have made remarkable progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, synthesizing images with high fidelity and diverse contents. Despite this advancement, latent space smoothness within diffusion models remains largely unexplored. Smooth latent spaces ensure that a perturbation on an input latent corresponds to a steady change in the output image. This property proves beneficial in downstream tasks, including image interpolation, inversion, and editing. In this work, we expose the non-smoothness of diffusion latent spaces by observing noticeable visual fluctuations resulting from minor latent variations. To tackle this issue, we propose Smooth Diffusion, a new category of diffusion models that can be simultaneously high-performing and smooth. Specifically, we introduce Step-wise Variation Regularization to enforce the proportion between the variations of an arbitrary input latent and that of the output image is a constant at any diffusion training step. In addition, we devise an interpolation standard deviation (ISTD) metric to effectively assess the latent space smoothness of a diffusion model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion stands out as a more desirable solution not only in T2I generation but also across various downstream tasks. Smooth Diffusion is implemented as a plug-and-play Smooth-LoRA to work with various community models.

However, the slow inference, high memory consumption, and computation intensity of the noise estimation model hinder the efficient adoption of diffusion models. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered a go-to compression method for other tasks, it does not work out-of-the-box on diffusion models. We propose a novel PTQ method specifically tailored towards the unique multi-timestep pipeline and model architecture of the diffusion models, which compresses the noise estimation network to accelerate the generation process. We identify the key difficulty of diffusion model quantization as the changing output distributions of noise estimation networks over multiple time steps and the bimodal activation distribution of the shortcut layers within the noise estimation network. We tackle these challenges with timestep-aware calibration and split shortcut quantization in this work. Experimental results show that our proposed method is able to quantize full-precision unconditional diffusion models into 4-bit while maintaining comparable performance (small FID change of at most 2.34 compared to >100 for traditional PTQ) in a training-free manner. Our approach can also be applied to text-guided image generation, where we can run stable diffusion in 4-bit weights with high generation quality for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/Xiuyu-Li/q-diffusion</p></details> |

Most existing approaches train for a certain distribution of masks, which limits their generalization capabilities to unseen mask types. Furthermore, training with pixel-wise and perceptual losses often leads to simple textural extensions towards the missing areas instead of semantically meaningful generation. In this work, we propose RePaint: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based inpainting approach that is applicable to even extreme masks. We employ a pretrained unconditional DDPM as the generative prior. To condition the generation process, we only alter the reverse diffusion iterations by sampling the unmasked regions using the given image information. Since this technique does not modify or condition the original DDPM network itself, the model produces high-quality and diverse output images for any inpainting form. We validate our method for both faces and general-purpose image inpainting using standard and extreme masks. RePaint outperforms state-of-the-art Autoregressive, and GAN approaches for at least five out of six mask distributions.

Although various techniques have been proposed to mitigate unwanted influences in diffusion models while preserving overall performance, achieving a balance between these goals remains challenging. In this work, we introduce EraseDiff, an algorithm designed to preserve the utility of the diffusion model on retained data while removing the unwanted information associated with the data to be forgotten. Our approach formulates this task as a constrained optimization problem using the value function, resulting in a natural first-order algorithm for solving the optimization problem. By altering the generative process to deviate away from the ground-truth denoising trajectory, we update parameters for preservation while controlling constraint reduction to ensure effective erasure, striking an optimal trade-off. Extensive experiments and thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate that EraseDiff effectively preserves the model's utility, efficacy, and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Diffu...</summary><p>Diffusion Model, Machine Unlearning</p></details> |

| **[Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Zero-Shot Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16203v3)** | 2023-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent wave of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has dramatically increased our text-based image generation abilities. These models can generate realistic images for a staggering variety of prompts and exhibit impressive compositional generalization abilities. Almost all use cases thus far have solely focused on sampling; however, diffusion models can also provide conditional density estimates, which are useful for tasks beyond image generation. In this paper, we show that the density estimates from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be leveraged to perform zero-shot classification without any additional training. Our generative approach to classification, which we call Diffusion Classifier, attains strong results on a variety of benchmarks and outperforms alternative methods of extracting knowledge from diffusion models. Although a gap remains between generative and discriminative approaches on zero-shot recognition tasks, our diffusion-based approach has significantly stronger multimodal compositional reasoning ability than competing discriminative approaches. Finally, we use Diffusion Classifier to extract standard classifiers from class-conditional diffusion models trained on ImageNet. Our models achieve strong classification performance using only weak augmentations and exhibit qualitatively better "effective robustness" to distribution shift. Overall, our results are a step toward using generative over discriminative models for downstream tasks.

Even when trained purely on images without explicit depth information, they typically output coherent pictures of 3D scenes. In this work, we investigate a basic interpretability question: does an LDM create and use an internal representation of simple scene geometry? Using linear probes, we find evidence that the internal activations of the LDM encode linear representations of both 3D depth data and a salient-object / background distinction. These representations appear surprisingly early in the denoising process$-$well before a human can easily make sense of the noisy images. Intervention experiments further indicate these representations play a causal role in image synthesis, and may be used for simple high-level editing of an LDM's output.

From a data-centric perspective addressing this limitation, we study diffusion dataset condensation as a new and challenging problem setting. The goal is to construct a "synthetic" sub-dataset with significantly fewer samples than the original dataset, enabling high-quality diffusion model training with greatly reduced cost. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally investigate dataset condensation for diffusion models, whereas prior work focused on training discriminative models. To tackle this new challenge, we propose a novel Diffusion Dataset Condensation (D2C) framework, which consists of two phases: Select and Attach. The Select phase identifies a compact and diverse subset using a diffusion difficulty score and interval sampling. The Attach phase enhances the selected subset by attaching rich semantic and visual representations to strengthen the conditional signals. Extensive experiments across various dataset sizes, model architectures, and resolutions show that our D2C framework enables significantly faster diffusion model training with dramatically fewer data, while preserving high visual quality. Notably, for the SiT-XL/2 architecture, D2C achieves a 100x training speed-up, reaching a FID score of 4.3 in just 40k steps using only 0.8% of the training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Iintr...</summary><p>Iintroduces D2C: a novel framework for diffusion dataset condensation</p></details> |

This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently alters the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations, providing diverse scenes and subjects as well as supervision to learn the separation of image content from lens blur. Central to our framework is our grounded self-attention mechanism, trained on image pairs with different bokeh levels of the same scene, which enables blur strength to be adjusted in both directions while preserving the underlying scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables flexible, lens-like blur control, supports downstream applications such as real image editing via inversion, and generalizes effectively across both Stable Diffusion and FLUX architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://atfortes.github.io/projects/bokeh-diffusion/</p></details> |

Although traditional trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory, overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts. In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA.

In contrast to previous work, functional diffusion works on samples that are represented by functions with a continuous domain. Functional diffusion can be seen as an extension of classical diffusion models to an infinite-dimensional domain. Functional diffusion is very versatile as images, videos, audio, 3D shapes, deformations, \etc, can be handled by the same framework with minimal changes. In addition, functional diffusion is especially suited for irregular data or data defined in non-standard domains. In our work, we derive the necessary foundations for functional diffusion and propose a first implementation based on the transformer architecture.

In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors.

However, for complex tasks, numerical error can compound and result in highly unnatural samples. Previous work mitigates this drift with thresholding, which projects to the natural data domain (such as pixel space for images) after each diffusion step, but this leads to a mismatch between the training and generative processes. To incorporate data constraints in a principled manner, we present Reflected Diffusion Models, which instead reverse a reflected stochastic differential equation evolving on the support of the data. Our approach learns the perturbed score function through a generalized score matching loss and extends key components of standard diffusion models including diffusion guidance, likelihood-based training, and ODE sampling. We also bridge the theoretical gap with thresholding: such schemes are just discretizations of reflected SDEs. On standard image benchmarks, our method is competitive with or surpasses the state of the art without architectural modifications and, for classifier-free guidance, our approach enables fast exact sampling with ODEs and produces more faithful samples under high guidance weight.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Camera Ready.

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

While some of these methods effectively address complex problems, they often depend heavily on inference-time obstacle detection and require additional equipment. Addressing these challenges, we present a method that, during inference time, simultaneously generates only reachable goals and plans motions that avoid obstacles, all from a single visual input. Central to our approach is the novel use of a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel for training. Through evaluations against behavior-cloning and classical diffusion models, our framework has proven its robustness. It is particularly effective in multi-modal environments, navigating toward goals and avoiding unreachable ones blocked by obstacles, while ensuring collision avoidance.

Diffusion models and many pre-trained language models have a shared training objective, i.e., denoising, making it possible to combine the two powerful models and enjoy the best of both worlds. On the one hand, diffusion models offer a promising training strategy that helps improve the generation quality. On the other hand, pre-trained denoising language models (e.g., BERT) can be used as a good initialization that accelerates convergence. We explore training BERT to learn the reverse process of a discrete diffusion process with an absorbing state and elucidate several designs to improve it. First, we propose a new noise schedule for the forward diffusion process that controls the degree of noise added at each step based on the information of each token. Second, we investigate several designs of incorporating the time step into BERT. Experiments on unconditional text generation demonstrate that DiffusionBERT achieves significant improvement over existing diffusion models for text (e.g., D3PM and Diffusion-LM) and previous generative masked language models in terms of perplexity and BLEU score.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

Despite the rapid landscape changes, recent new approaches focus on extensions and performance rather than capacity, thus requiring separate models for separate tasks. In this work, we expand the existing single-flow diffusion pipeline into a multi-task multimodal network, dubbed Versatile Diffusion (VD), that handles multiple flows of text-to-image, image-to-text, and variations in one unified model. The pipeline design of VD instantiates a unified multi-flow diffusion framework, consisting of sharable and swappable layer modules that enable the crossmodal generality beyond images and text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VD successfully achieves the following: a) VD outperforms the baseline approaches and handles all its base tasks with competitive quality; b) VD enables novel extensions such as disentanglement of style and semantics, dual- and multi-context blending, etc.; c) The success of our multi-flow multimodal framework over images and text may inspire further diffusion-based universal AI research.

Our diffusion-based framework offers unique advantages stemming from its inherent stochasticity and holistic context modeling in captioning. Through rigorous evaluation, we demonstrate that DAC not only achieves SOTA performance levels compared to existing benchmarks in the caption quality, but also significantly outperforms them in terms of generation speed and diversity.

We introduce a loss function based on the Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator (GSURE), and prove that under some conditions, it is equivalent to the training objective used in fully supervised diffusion models. We demonstrate our technique on face images as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), where the use of undersampled data significantly alleviates data collection costs.

Whereas, as a way inherently built for continuous data, existing diffusion models still have some limitations in modeling discrete data, e.g., languages. For example, the generally used Gaussian noise can not handle the discrete corruption well, and the objectives in continuous spaces fail to be stable for textual data in the diffusion process especially when the dimension is high. To alleviate these issues, we introduce a novel diffusion model for language modeling, Masked-Diffuse LM, with lower training cost and better performances, inspired by linguistic features in languages. Specifically, we design a linguistic-informed forward process which adds corruptions to the text through strategically soft-masking to better noise the textual data. Also, we directly predict the categorical distribution with cross-entropy loss function in every diffusion step to connect the continuous space and discrete space in a more efficient and straightforward way. Through experiments on 5 controlled generation tasks, we demonstrate that our Masked-Diffuse LM can achieve better generation quality than the state-of-the-art diffusion models with better efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/masked-diffusion-lm</p></details> |

PG methods are ubiquitous in training RL policies with other policy parameterizations; nevertheless, they had been conjectured to be less efficient for diffusion-based policies. Surprisingly, we show that DPPO achieves the strongest overall performance and efficiency for fine-tuning in common benchmarks compared to other RL methods for diffusion-based policies and also compared to PG fine-tuning of other policy parameterizations. Through experimental investigation, we find that DPPO takes advantage of unique synergies between RL fine-tuning and the diffusion parameterization, leading to structured and on-manifold exploration, stable training, and strong policy robustness. We further demonstrate the strengths of DPPO in a range of realistic settings, including simulated robotic tasks with pixel observations, and via zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on robot hardware in a long-horizon, multi-stage manipulation task.

We revisit diffusion-based Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches. Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple, model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

Yet diffusion models have garnered increasing attention, as they offer comparable performance while being permutation-invariant. Current graph diffusion models generate graphs in a one-shot fashion, but they require extra features and thousands of denoising steps to achieve optimal performance. We introduce PARD, a Permutation-invariant Auto Regressive Diffusion model that integrates diffusion models with autoregressive methods. PARD harnesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the autoregressive model while maintaining permutation invariance without ordering sensitivity. Specifically, we show that contrary to sets, elements in a graph are not entirely unordered and there is a unique partial order for nodes and edges. With this partial order, PARD generates a graph in a block-by-block, autoregressive fashion, where each block's probability is conditionally modeled by a shared diffusion model with an equivariant network. To ensure efficiency while being expressive, we further propose a higher-order graph transformer, which integrates transformer with PPGN. Like GPT, we extend the higher-order graph transformer to support parallel training of all blocks. Without any extra features, PARD achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and non-molecular datasets, and scales to large datasets like MOSES containing 1.9M molecules.

In the current paper we aim to underscore a discrepancy between conventional training methods and the desired conditional sampling behavior of these models. While the prevalent classifier-free guidance technique works well, it's not without flaws. At higher values for the guidance scale parameter $w$, we often get out of distribution samples and mode collapse, whereas at lower values for $w$ we may not get the desired specificity. To address these challenges, we introduce an updated loss function that better aligns training objectives with sampling behaviors. Experimental validation with FID scores on CIFAR-10 elucidates our method's ability to produce higher quality samples with fewer sampling timesteps, and be more robust to the choice of guidance scale $w$.

We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models.

| **[Unified Discrete Diffusion for Categorical Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03701v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models have seen a surge of attention with applications on naturally discrete data such as language and graphs. Although discrete-time discrete diffusion has been established for a while, only recently Campbell et al. (2022) introduced the first framework for continuous-time discrete diffusion. However, their training and sampling processes differ significantly from the discrete-time version, necessitating nontrivial approximations for tractability. In this paper, we first present a series of mathematical simplifications of the variational lower bound that enable more accurate and easy-to-optimize training for discrete diffusion. In addition, we derive a simple formulation for backward denoising that enables exact and accelerated sampling, and importantly, an elegant unification of discrete-time and continuous-time discrete diffusion. Thanks to simpler analytical formulations, both forward and now also backward probabilities can flexibly accommodate any noise distribution, including different noise distributions for multi-element objects. Experiments show that our proposed USD3 (for Unified Simplified Discrete Denoising Diffusion) outperform all SOTA baselines on established datasets. We open-source our unified code at https://github.com/LingxiaoShawn/USD3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Unify...</summary><p>Unify Discrete Denoising Diffusion</p></details> |

We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of tokens drawn from the true joint distribution.

| **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15857v7)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings where training involves repeated passes over limited data and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. Finally, we explain why diffusion models excel in this regime: their randomized masking objective implicitly trains over a rich distribution of token orderings, acting as an implicit data augmentation that AR's fixed left-to-right factorization lacks. Our results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

Alongside the classic total inference tasks (i.e., generating a mixture, separating the sources), we also introduce and experiment on the partial generation task of source imputation, where we generate a subset of the sources given the others (e.g., play a piano track that goes well with the drums). Additionally, we introduce a novel inference method for the separation task based on Dirac likelihood functions. We train our model on Slakh2100, a standard dataset for musical source separation, provide qualitative results in the generation settings, and showcase competitive quantitative results in the source separation setting. Our method is the first example of a single model that can handle both generation and separation tasks, thus representing a step toward general audio models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 oral presentation.

In this work, we find that generative models can be great test-time adapters for discriminative models. Our method, Diffusion-TTA, adapts pre-trained discriminative models such as image classifiers, segmenters and depth predictors, to each unlabelled example in the test set using generative feedback from a diffusion model. We achieve this by modulating the conditioning of the diffusion model using the output of the discriminative model. We then maximize the image likelihood objective by backpropagating the gradients to discriminative model's parameters. We show Diffusion-TTA significantly enhances the accuracy of various large-scale pre-trained discriminative models, such as, ImageNet classifiers, CLIP models, image pixel labellers and image depth predictors. Diffusion-TTA outperforms existing test-time adaptation methods, including TTT-MAE and TENT, and particularly shines in online adaptation setups, where the discriminative model is continually adapted to each example in the test set.

This paper studies amortized sampling of the posterior over data, $\mathbf{x}\sim p^{\rm post}(\mathbf{x})\propto p(\mathbf{x})r(\mathbf{x})$, in a model that consists of a diffusion generative model prior $p(\mathbf{x})$ and a black-box constraint or likelihood function $r(\mathbf{x})$. We state and prove the asymptotic correctness of a data-free learning objective, relative trajectory balance, for training a diffusion model that samples from this posterior, a problem that existing methods solve only approximately or in restricted cases. Relative trajectory balance arises from the generative flow network perspective on diffusion models, which allows the use of deep reinforcement learning techniques to improve mode coverage. Experiments illustrate the broad potential of unbiased inference of arbitrary posteriors under diffusion priors: in vision (classifier guidance), language (infilling under a discrete diffusion LLM), and multimodal data (text-to-image generation). Beyond generative modeling, we apply relative trajectory balance to the problem of continuous control with a score-based behavior prior, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks in offline reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024; code: https://github.com/GFNOrg/diffusion-finetuning</p></details> |
| **[Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning of Diffusion Models with Energy-Based Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00626v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for improving the sample quality of diffusion generative models, especially when the number of generation time steps is small. Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps. Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Oral Presentation.

Acquiring such vast datasets, however, poses a significant challenge in many clinical applications. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel 3D brain segmentation approach using complementary 2D diffusion models. The core idea behind our approach is to first mine 2D features with semantic information extracted from the 2D diffusion models by taking orthogonal views as input, followed by fusing them into a 3D contextual feature representation. Then, we use these aggregated features to train multi-layer perceptrons to classify the segmentation labels. Our goal is to achieve reliable segmentation quality without requiring complete labels for each individual subject. Our experiments on training in brain subcortical structure segmentation with a dataset from only one subject demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Further experiments on the minimum requirement of annotation by sparse labeling yield promising results even with only nine slices and a labeled background region.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of "3D Segmentation of Subcortical Brain Structure with Few Labeled Data using 2D Diffusion Models" (ISMRM 2024 oral)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose the use of diffusion models as they offer a promising approach to gradually refine the details of shadow regions during the diffusion process. Our method improves this process by conditioning on a learned latent feature space that inherits the characteristics of shadow-free images, thus avoiding the limitation of conventional methods that condition on degraded images only. Additionally, we propose to alleviate potential local optima during training by fusing noise features with the diffusion network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach which outperforms the previous best method by 13% in terms of RMSE on the AISTD dataset. Further, we explore instance-level shadow removal, where our model outperforms the previous best method by 82% in terms of RMSE on the DESOBA dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page see https://kfmei.com/shadow-diffusion/</p></details> |

Existing methods typically employ a teacher-student framework with pseudo-labeling to leverage unlabeled point clouds. However, producing reliable pseudo-labels in a diverse 3D space still remains challenging. In this work, we propose Diffusion-SS3D, a new perspective of enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels via the diffusion model for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Specifically, we include noises to produce corrupted 3D object size and class label distributions, and then utilize the diffusion model as a denoising process to obtain bounding box outputs. Moreover, we integrate the diffusion model into the teacher-student framework, so that the denoised bounding boxes can be used to improve pseudo-label generation, as well as the entire semi-supervised learning process. We conduct experiments on the ScanNet and SUN RGB-D benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing methods. We also present extensive analysis to understand how our diffusion model design affects performance in semi-supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2023.

| **[The Emergence of Reproducibility and Generalizability in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05264v4)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate an intriguing and prevalent phenomenon of diffusion models which we term as "consistent model reproducibility": given the same starting noise input and a deterministic sampler, different diffusion models often yield remarkably similar outputs. We confirm this phenomenon through comprehensive experiments, implying that different diffusion models consistently reach the same data distribution and scoring function regardless of diffusion model frameworks, model architectures, or training procedures. More strikingly, our further investigation implies that diffusion models are learning distinct distributions affected by the training data size. This is supported by the fact that the model reproducibility manifests in two distinct training regimes: (i) "memorization regime", where the diffusion model overfits to the training data distribution, and (ii) "generalization regime", where the model learns the underlying data distribution. Our study also finds that this valuable property generalizes to many variants of diffusion models, including those for conditional use, solving inverse problems, and model fine-tuning. Finally, our work raises numerous intriguing theoretical questions for future investigation and highlights practical implications regarding training efficiency, model privacy, and the controlled generation of diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Diffusion Model Workshop 2023 (best paper award), the Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |
| **[On Discrete Prompt Optimization for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01606v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the first gradient-based framework for prompt optimization in text-to-image diffusion models. We formulate prompt engineering as a discrete optimization problem over the language space. Two major challenges arise in efficiently finding a solution to this problem: (1) Enormous Domain Space: Setting the domain to the entire language space poses significant difficulty to the optimization process. (2) Text Gradient: Efficiently computing the text gradient is challenging, as it requires backpropagating through the inference steps of the diffusion model and a non-differentiable embedding lookup table. Beyond the problem formulation, our main technical contributions lie in solving the above challenges. First, we design a family of dynamically generated compact subspaces comprised of only the most relevant words to user input, substantially restricting the domain space. Second, we introduce "Shortcut Text Gradient" -- an effective replacement for the text gradient that can be obtained with constant memory and runtime. Empirical evaluation on prompts collected from diverse sources (DiffusionDB, ChatGPT, COCO) suggests that our method can discover prompts that substantially improve (prompt enhancement) or destroy (adversarial attack) the faithfulness of images generated by the text-to-image diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

We improve the quality of these models with a novel continuous-time variational lower bound that yields state-of-the-art performance, especially in settings involving guidance or fast generation.

Crucially, standard diffusion models rely on the well-established theory of score matching, but efforts to generalize this to discrete structures have not yielded the same empirical gains. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing score entropy, a novel loss that naturally extends score matching to discrete spaces, integrates seamlessly to build discrete diffusion models, and significantly boosts performance. Experimentally, we test our Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD) on standard language modeling tasks. For comparable model sizes, SEDD beats existing language diffusion paradigms (reducing perplexity by $25$-$75$\%) and is competitive with autoregressive models, in particular outperforming GPT-2. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive mdoels, SEDD generates faithful text without requiring distribution annealing techniques like temperature scaling (around $6$-$8\times$ better generative perplexity than un-annealed GPT-2), can trade compute and quality (similar quality with $32\times$ fewer network evaluations), and enables controllable infilling (matching nucleus sampling quality while enabling other strategies besides left to right prompting).</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 Oral.

Diffusion models have gained prominence for their effectiveness in high-fidelity image generation. While conventional approaches rely on convolutional U-Net architectures, recent Transformer-based designs have demonstrated superior performance and scalability. However, Transformer architectures, which tokenize input data (via "patchification"), face a trade-off between visual fidelity and computational complexity due to the quadratic nature of self-attention operations concerning token length. While larger patch sizes enable attention computation efficiency, they struggle to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to image distortions. To address this challenge, we propose augmenting the Diffusion model with the Multi-Resolution network (DiMR), a framework that refines features across multiple resolutions, progressively enhancing detail from low to high resolution. Additionally, we introduce Time-Dependent Layer Normalization (TD-LN), a parameter-efficient approach that incorporates time-dependent parameters into layer normalization to inject time information and achieve superior performance. Our method's efficacy is demonstrated on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, where DiMR-XL variants outperform prior diffusion models, setting new state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.70 on ImageNet 256 x 256 and 2.89 on ImageNet 512 x 512.

Current large TTS systems usually quantize speech into discrete tokens and use language models to generate these tokens one by one, which suffer from unstable prosody, word skipping/repeating issue, and poor voice quality. In this paper, we develop NaturalSpeech 2, a TTS system that leverages a neural audio codec with residual vector quantizers to get the quantized latent vectors and uses a diffusion model to generate these latent vectors conditioned on text input. To enhance the zero-shot capability that is important to achieve diverse speech synthesis, we design a speech prompting mechanism to facilitate in-context learning in the diffusion model and the duration/pitch predictor. We scale NaturalSpeech 2 to large-scale datasets with 44K hours of speech and singing data and evaluate its voice quality on unseen speakers. NaturalSpeech 2 outperforms previous TTS systems by a large margin in terms of prosody/timbre similarity, robustness, and voice quality in a zero-shot setting, and performs novel zero-shot singing synthesis with only a speech prompt.

In this paper, we present a method to decompose an image into such compositional components. Our approach, Decomp Diffusion, is an unsupervised method which, when given a single image, infers a set of different components in the image, each represented by a diffusion model. We demonstrate how components can capture different factors of the scene, ranging from global scene descriptors like shadows or facial expression to local scene descriptors like constituent objects.

We leverage this characteristic to encourage model diversity and empirically show the efficacy of the approach with respect to several diversification objectives. We show that diffusion-guided diversification can lead models to avert attention from shortcut cues, achieving ensemble diversity performance comparable to previous methods requiring additional data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Neural Information Processing Systems(NeurIPS) 2023 - Workshop on Diffusion Models</p></details> |

In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution, while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre François Baclesse.

| **[Sprite Sheet Diffusion: Generate Game Character for Animation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03685v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the game development process, creating character animations is a vital step that involves several stages. Typically for 2D games, illustrators begin by designing the main character image, which serves as the foundation for all subsequent animations. To create a smooth motion sequence, these subsequent animations involve drawing the character in different poses and actions, such as running, jumping, or attacking. This process requires significant manual effort from illustrators, as they must meticulously ensure consistency in design, proportions, and style across multiple motion frames. Each frame is drawn individually, making this a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. Generative models, such as diffusion models, have the potential to revolutionize this process by automating the creation of sprite sheets. Diffusion models, known for their ability to generate diverse images, can be adapted to create character animations.

While prior research has established quantifiable links between model output and training data in diverse settings, interpreting diffusion model outputs in relation to training samples remains underexplored. In particular, diffusion models operate over a sequence of timesteps instead of instantaneous input-output relationships in previous contexts, posing a significant challenge to extend existing frameworks to diffusion models directly. Notably, we present Diffusion-TracIn that incorporates this temporal dynamics and observe that samples' loss gradient norms are highly dependent on timestep. This trend leads to a prominent bias in influence estimation, and is particularly noticeable for samples trained on large-norm-inducing timesteps, causing them to be generally influential. To mitigate this effect, we introduce Diffusion-ReTrac as a re-normalized adaptation that enables the retrieval of training samples more targeted to the test sample of interest, facilitating a localized measurement of influence and considerably more intuitive visualization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through various evaluation metrics and auxiliary tasks, reducing the amount of generally influential samples to $\frac{1}{3}$ of its original quantity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR.

Such a prior has been used with conditioning to solve the inpainting problem, but only supporting binary user-based conditioning. We derive a fuzzy-conditioned diffusion, where implicit diffusion priors can be exploited with controllable strength. Our fuzzy conditioning can be applied pixel-wise, enabling the modification of different image components to varying degrees. Additionally, we propose an application to facial image correction, where we combine our fuzzy-conditioned diffusion with diffusion-derived attention maps. Our map estimates the degree of anomaly, and we obtain it by projecting on the diffusion space. We show how our approach also leads to interpretable and autonomous facial image correction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on https://github.com/majedelhelou/FC-Diffusion</p></details> |

Prior works on time series diffusion models have primarily focused on developing conditional models tailored to specific forecasting or imputation tasks. In this work, we explore the potential of task-agnostic, unconditional diffusion models for several time series applications. We propose TSDiff, an unconditionally-trained diffusion model for time series. Our proposed self-guidance mechanism enables conditioning TSDiff for downstream tasks during inference, without requiring auxiliary networks or altering the training procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three different time series tasks: forecasting, refinement, and synthetic data generation. First, we show that TSDiff is competitive with several task-specific conditional forecasting methods (predict). Second, we leverage the learned implicit probability density of TSDiff to iteratively refine the predictions of base forecasters with reduced computational overhead over reverse diffusion (refine). Notably, the generative performance of the model remains intact -- downstream forecasters trained on synthetic samples from TSDiff outperform forecasters that are trained on samples from other state-of-the-art generative time series models, occasionally even outperforming models trained on real data (synthesize).</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/amazon-science/unconditional-time-series-diffusion</p></details> |

Diffusion Reward is accordingly formalized by the negative of conditional entropy that encourages productive exploration of expert behaviors.

In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can also \textit{generate high-performing neural network parameters}. Our approach is simple, utilizing an autoencoder and a diffusion model. The autoencoder extracts latent representations of a subset of the trained neural network parameters. Next, a diffusion model is trained to synthesize these latent representations from random noise. This model then generates new representations, which are passed through the autoencoder's decoder to produce new subsets of high-performing network parameters. Across various architectures and datasets, our approach consistently generates models with comparable or improved performance over trained networks, with minimal additional cost.

| **[Diffusion Sampling with Momentum for Mitigating Divergence Artifacts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11118v1)** | 2023-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in image generation, slow sampling remains a persistent issue. To accelerate the sampling process, prior studies have reformulated diffusion sampling as an ODE/SDE and introduced higher-order numerical methods. However, these methods often produce divergence artifacts, especially with a low number of sampling steps, which limits the achievable acceleration. In this paper, we investigate the potential causes of these artifacts and suggest that the small stability regions of these methods could be the principal cause. To address this issue, we propose two novel techniques. The first technique involves the incorporation of Heavy Ball (HB) momentum, a well-known technique for improving optimization, into existing diffusion numerical methods to expand their stability regions. We also prove that the resulting methods have first-order convergence. The second technique, called Generalized Heavy Ball (GHVB), constructs a new high-order method that offers a variable trade-off between accuracy and artifact suppression. Experimental results show that our techniques are highly effective in reducing artifacts and improving image quality, surpassing state-of-the-art diffusion solvers on both pixel-based and latent-based diffusion models for low-step sampling. Our research provides novel insights into the design of numerical methods for future diffusion work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/sWizad/momentum-diffusion</p></details> |
| **[To the Noise and Back: Diffusion for Shared Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12244v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared autonomy is an operational concept in which a user and an autonomous agent collaboratively control a robotic system. It provides a number of advantages over the extremes of full-teleoperation and full-autonomy in many settings. Traditional approaches to shared autonomy rely on knowledge of the environment dynamics, a discrete space of user goals that is known a priori, or knowledge of the user's policy -- assumptions that are unrealistic in many domains. Recent works relax some of these assumptions by formulating shared autonomy with model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, they no longer need knowledge of the goal space (e.g., that the goals are discrete or constrained) or environment dynamics. However, they need knowledge of a task-specific reward function to train the policy. Unfortunately, such reward specification can be a difficult and brittle process. On top of that, the formulations inherently rely on human-in-the-loop training, and that necessitates them to prepare a policy that mimics users' behavior. In this paper, we present a new approach to shared autonomy that employs a modulation of the forward and reverse diffusion process of diffusion models. Our approach does not assume known environment dynamics or the space of user goals, and in contrast to previous work, it does not require any reward feedback, nor does it require access to the user's policy during training. Instead, our framework learns a distribution over a space of desired behaviors. It then employs a diffusion model to translate the user's actions to a sample from this distribution. Crucially, we show that it is possible to carry out this process in a manner that preserves the user's control authority. We evaluate our framework on a series of challenging continuous control tasks, and analyze its ability to effectively correct user actions while maintaining their autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://diffusion-for-shared-autonomy.github.io/</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose Diffusion-GAN, a novel GAN framework that leverages a forward diffusion chain to generate Gaussian-mixture distributed instance noise. Diffusion-GAN consists of three components, including an adaptive diffusion process, a diffusion timestep-dependent discriminator, and a generator. Both the observed and generated data are diffused by the same adaptive diffusion process. At each diffusion timestep, there is a different noise-to-data ratio and the timestep-dependent discriminator learns to distinguish the diffused real data from the diffused generated data. The generator learns from the discriminator's feedback by backpropagating through the forward diffusion chain, whose length is adaptively adjusted to balance the noise and data levels. We theoretically show that the discriminator's timestep-dependent strategy gives consistent and helpful guidance to the generator, enabling it to match the true data distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of Diffusion-GAN over strong GAN baselines on various datasets, showing that it can produce more realistic images with higher stability and data efficiency than state-of-the-art GANs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project homepage: https://github.com/Zhendong-Wang/Diffusion-GAN; ICLR 2023 camera ready version</p></details> |
| **[From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with TaylorSeers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06923v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

However, their applicability is limited to scenarios where training samples are readily available, which is not always the case in real-world applications. For example, in inverse graphics, the goal is to generate samples from a distribution of 3D scenes that align with a given image, but ground-truth 3D scenes are unavailable and only 2D images are accessible. To address this limitation, we propose a novel class of denoising diffusion probabilistic models that learn to sample from distributions of signals that are never directly observed. Instead, these signals are measured indirectly through a known differentiable forward model, which produces partial observations of the unknown signal. Our approach involves integrating the forward model directly into the denoising process. This integration effectively connects the generative modeling of observations with the generative modeling of the underlying signals, allowing for end-to-end training of a conditional generative model over signals. During inference, our approach enables sampling from the distribution of underlying signals that are consistent with a given partial observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three challenging computer vision tasks. For instance, in the context of inverse graphics, our model enables direct sampling from the distribution of 3D scenes that align with a single 2D input image.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://diffusion-with-forward-models.github.io/</p></details> |

However, their performance significantly declines when generating content at resolutions higher than those used during training. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enable high-resolution generation, they all suffer from inefficiency. In this paper, we propose RectifiedHR, a straightforward and efficient solution for training-free high-resolution synthesis. Specifically, we propose a noise refresh strategy that unlocks the model's training-free high-resolution synthesis capability and improves efficiency. Additionally, we are the first to observe the phenomenon of energy decay, which may cause image blurriness during the high-resolution synthesis process. To address this issue, we introduce average latent energy analysis and find that tuning the classifier-free guidance hyperparameter can significantly improve generation performance. Our method is entirely training-free and demonstrates efficient performance. Furthermore, we show that RectifiedHR is compatible with various diffusion model techniques, enabling advanced features such as image editing, customized generation, and video synthesis.

Handling generic images requires a diverse underlying generative model, hence the latest works utilize diffusion models, which were shown to surpass GANs in terms of diversity. One major drawback of diffusion models, however, is their relatively slow inference time. In this paper, we present an accelerated solution to the task of local text-driven editing of generic images, where the desired edits are confined to a user-provided mask. Our solution leverages a recent text-to-image Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), which speeds up diffusion by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. We first convert the LDM into a local image editor by incorporating Blended Diffusion into it. Next we propose an optimization-based solution for the inherent inability of this LDM to accurately reconstruct images. Finally, we address the scenario of performing local edits using thin masks. We evaluate our method against the available baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively and demonstrate that in addition to being faster, our method achieves better precision than the baselines while mitigating some of their artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2023.

While the proposed model achieved state-of-the-art results, high computational demands due to multi-step inference limited its use in many scenarios. In this paper, we show that the perceived inefficiency was caused by a flaw in the inference pipeline that has so far gone unnoticed. The fixed model performs comparably to the best previously reported configuration while being more than 200$\times$ faster. To optimize for downstream task performance, we perform end-to-end fine-tuning on top of the single-step model with task-specific losses and get a deterministic model that outperforms all other diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models on common zero-shot benchmarks. We surprisingly find that this fine-tuning protocol also works directly on Stable Diffusion and achieves comparable performance to current state-of-the-art diffusion-based depth and normal estimation models, calling into question some of the conclusions drawn from prior works.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2025 Oral.

Many of these deviate from Brownian motion, giving rise to anomalous diffusion. Various theoretical models exists nowadays to describe such processes, but their application to experimental setups is often challenging, due to the stochastic nature of the phenomena and the difficulty to harness reliable data. The latter often consists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with usual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive effort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning techniques, with astonishing results. In this work, we explore the use of unsupervised methods in anomalous diffusion data. We show that the main diffusion characteristics can be learnt without the need of any labelling of the data. We use such method to discriminate between anomalous diffusion models and extract their physical parameters. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of finding novel types of diffusion, in this case represented by compositions of existing diffusion models.

We tackle the challenging task of inverting the latent space of pre-trained face recognition models without full model access (i.e. black-box setting). A variety of methods have been proposed in literature for this task, but they have serious shortcomings such as a lack of realistic outputs and strong requirements for the data set and accessibility of the face recognition model. By analyzing the black-box inversion problem, we show that the conditional diffusion model loss naturally emerges and that we can effectively sample from the inverse distribution even without an identity-specific loss. Our method, named identity denoising diffusion probabilistic model (ID3PM), leverages the stochastic nature of the denoising diffusion process to produce high-quality, identity-preserving face images with various backgrounds, lighting, poses, and expressions. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of identity preservation and diversity both qualitatively and quantitatively, and our method is the first black-box face recognition model inversion method that offers intuitive control over the generation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main paper + 23 pages supplementary material.

Deep generative models can translate the target modality images into the source modality, thus enabling cross-modality segmentation. However, a vast body of existing cross-modality image translation methods relies on supervised learning. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of zero-shot learning-based image translation tasks (extreme scenarios in the target modality is unseen in the training phase). To leverage generative learning for zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation, we propose a novel unsupervised image translation method. The framework learns to translate the unseen source image to the target modality for image segmentation by leveraging the inherent statistical consistency between different modalities for diffusion guidance. Our framework captures identical cross-modality features in the statistical domain, offering diffusion guidance without relying on direct mappings between the source and target domains. This advantage allows our method to adapt to changing source domains without the need for retraining, making it highly practical when sufficient labeled source domain data is not available. The proposed framework is validated in zero-shot cross-modality image segmentation tasks through empirical comparisons with influential generative models, including adversarial-based and diffusion-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2023 Diffusion Workshop</p></details> |

However, their efficacy and applicability to achieve extreme compression ratios ($<0.05$ bpp) remain constrained. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective coding framework by introducing vector quantization (VQ)--based generative models into the image compression domain. The main insight is that the codebook learned by the VQGAN model yields a strong expressive capacity, facilitating efficient compression of continuous information in the latent space while maintaining reconstruction quality. Specifically, an image can be represented as VQ-indices by finding the nearest codeword, which can be encoded using lossless compression methods into bitstreams. We propose clustering a pre-trained large-scale codebook into smaller codebooks through the K-means algorithm, yielding variable bitrates and different levels of reconstruction quality within the coding framework. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer to predict lost indices and restore images in unstable environments. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art codecs in terms of perceptual quality-oriented metrics and human perception at extremely low bitrates ($\le 0.04$ bpp). Remarkably, even with the loss of up to $20\%$ of indices, the images can be effectively restored with minimal perceptual loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gener...</summary><p>Generative Compression, Extreme Compression, VQGANs, Low Bitrate</p></details> |

Matrix factorization, a well-established technique from matrix theory, has been utilized to reduce the number of parameters in PLM. However, it fails to retain satisfactory performance under moderate to high compression rate. In this paper, we identify the \textit{full-rankness} of fine-tuned PLM as the fundamental bottleneck for the failure of matrix factorization and explore the use of network pruning to extract low-rank sparsity pattern desirable to matrix factorization. We find such low-rank sparsity pattern exclusively exists in models generated by first-order pruning, which motivates us to unite the two approaches and achieve more effective model compression. We further propose two techniques: sparsity-aware SVD and mixed-rank fine-tuning, which improve the initialization and training of the compression procedure, respectively. Experiments on GLUE and question-answering tasks show that the proposed method has superior compression-performance trade-off compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | Model Compression |

| **[Learned Compression for Compressed Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09405v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern sensors produce increasingly rich streams of high-resolution data. Due to resource constraints, machine learning systems discard the vast majority of this information via resolution reduction. Compressed-domain learning allows models to operate on compact latent representations, allowing higher effective resolution for the same budget. However, existing compression systems are not ideal for compressed learning. Linear transform coding and end-to-end learned compression systems reduce bitrate, but do not uniformly reduce dimensionality; thus, they do not meaningfully increase efficiency. Generative autoencoders reduce dimensionality, but their adversarial or perceptual objectives lead to significant information loss. To address these limitations, we introduce WaLLoC (Wavelet Learned Lossy Compression), a neural codec architecture that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. WaLLoC sandwiches a shallow, asymmetric autoencoder and entropy bottleneck between an invertible wavelet packet transform. Across several key metrics, WaLLoC outperforms the autoencoders used in state-of-the-art latent diffusion models. WaLLoC does not require perceptual or adversarial losses to represent high-frequency detail, providing compatibility with modalities beyond RGB images and stereo audio. WaLLoC's encoder consists almost entirely of linear operations, making it exceptionally efficient and suitable for mobile computing, remote sensing, and learning directly from compressed data. We demonstrate WaLLoC's capability for compressed-domain learning across several tasks, including image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation. Our code, experiments, and pre-trained audio and image codecs are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as paper to 2025 IEEE Data Compression Conference</p></details> |

Massive amount of high precision depth maps are produced with the rapid development of equipment like laser scanner or LiDAR. Therefore, it is urgent to explore a new compression method with better compression ratio for high precision depth maps. Utilizing the wide spread deep learning environment, we propose an end-to-end learning-based lossless compression method for high precision depth maps. The whole process is comprised of two sub-processes, named pre-processing of depth maps and deep lossless compression of processed depth maps. The deep lossless compression network consists of two sub-networks, named lossy compression network and lossless compression network. We leverage the concept of pseudo-residual to guide the generation of distribution for residual and avoid introducing context models. Our end-to-end lossless compression network achieves competitive performance over engineered codecs and has low computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data Compression Conference 2022</p></details> |

However, due to the sparsity and unordered structure of the data, it is difficult to compress point cloud data to a low volume. Transforming the raw point cloud data into a dense 2D matrix structure is a promising way for applying compression algorithms. We propose a new lossless and calibrated 3D-to-2D transformation which allows compression algorithms to efficiently exploit spatial correlations within the 2D representation. To compress the structured representation, we use common image compression methods and also a self-supervised deep compression approach using a recurrent neural network. We also rearrange the LiDAR's intensity measurements to a dense 2D representation and propose a new metric to evaluate the compression performance of the intensity. Compared to approaches that are based on generic octree point cloud compression or based on raw point cloud data compression, our approach achieves the best quantitative and visual performance.

| **[A Survey on Transformer Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05964v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer plays a vital role in the realms of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), specially for constructing large language models (LLM) and large vision models (LVM). Model compression methods reduce the memory and computational cost of Transformer, which is a necessary step to implement large language/vision models on practical devices. Given the unique architecture of Transformer, featuring alternative attention and feedforward neural network (FFN) modules, specific compression techniques are usually required. The efficiency of these compression methods is also paramount, as retraining large models on the entire training dataset is usually impractical. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent compression methods, with a specific focus on their application to Transformer-based models. The compression methods are primarily categorized into pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation, and efficient architecture design (Mamba, RetNet, RWKV, etc.). In each category, we discuss compression methods for both language and vision tasks, highlighting common underlying principles. Finally, we delve into the relation between various compression methods, and discuss further directions in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Model...</summary><p>Model Compression, Transformer, Large Language Model, Large Vision Model, LLM</p></details> |
| **[Neural Normalized Compression Distance and the Disconnect Between Compression and Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15280v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is generally well understood that predictive classification and compression are intrinsically related concepts in information theory. Indeed, many deep learning methods are explained as learning a kind of compression, and that better compression leads to better performance. We interrogate this hypothesis via the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD), which explicitly relies on compression as the means of measuring similarity between sequences and thus enables nearest-neighbor classification. By turning popular large language models (LLMs) into lossless compressors, we develop a Neural NCD and compare LLMs to classic general-purpose algorithms like gzip. In doing so, we find that classification accuracy is not predictable by compression rate alone, among other empirical aberrations not predicted by current understanding. Our results imply that our intuition on what it means for a neural network to ``compress'' and what is needed for effective classification are not yet well understood.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Machine Learning and Compression Workshop at 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems</p></details> |

These terms are applied on the encoder output of an autoencoder and are used in combination with reconstruction losses. The compression objective encourages sparsity and low entropy in the activations. The cycle loss term represents the distortion between encoder outputs computed from the original image and from the reconstructed image (code-domain distortion). We train different autoencoders by using the compression objective in combination with different losses: a) MSE, b) MSE and MSSSIM, c) MSE, MS-SSIM and cycle loss. We observe that images encoded by these differently-trained autoencoders fall into different points of the perception-distortion curve (while having similar bit-rates). In particular, MSE-only training favors low image-domain distortion, whereas cycle loss training favors high perceptual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Challenge and Workshop on Learned Image Compression (CLIC) as a part of CVPR 2019</p></details> |

This paper investigates how deep multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) encode these feature manifolds and connects this behavior to the Information Bottleneck (IB) theory. We introduce the concept of local rank as a measure of feature manifold dimensionality and demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that this rank decreases during the final phase of training. We argue that networks that reduce the rank of their learned representations also compress mutual information between inputs and intermediate layers. This work bridges the gap between feature manifold rank and information compression, offering new insights into the interplay between information bottlenecks and representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Compression Workshop @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Despite its advantages in rendering speed and image fidelity, 3DGS is limited by its significant storage and memory demands. These high demands make 3DGS impractical for mobile devices or headsets, reducing its applicability in important areas of computer graphics. To address these challenges and advance the practicality of 3DGS, this survey provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of compression and compaction techniques developed to make 3DGS more efficient. We classify existing methods into two categories: compression, which focuses on reducing file size, and compaction, which aims to minimize the number of Gaussians. Both methods aim to maintain or improve quality, each by minimizing its respective attribute: file size for compression and Gaussian count for compaction. We introduce the basic mathematical concepts underlying the analyzed methods, as well as key implementation details and design choices. Our report thoroughly discusses similarities and differences among the methods, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages. We establish a consistent framework for comparing the surveyed methods based on key performance metrics and datasets. Specifically, since these methods have been developed in parallel and over a short period of time, currently, no comprehensive comparison exists. This survey, for the first time, presents a unified framework to evaluate 3DGS compression techniques.

| **[Compression Represents Intelligence Linearly](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09937v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of "intelligence", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLM ...</summary><p>COLM 2024.

| **[Filter Distillation for Network Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10585v4)** | 2019-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we introduce Principal Filter Analysis (PFA), an easy to use and effective method for neural network compression. PFA exploits the correlation between filter responses within network layers to recommend a smaller network that maintain as much as possible the accuracy of the full model. We propose two algorithms: the first allows users to target compression to specific network property, such as number of trainable variable (footprint), and produces a compressed model that satisfies the requested property while preserving the maximum amount of spectral energy in the responses of each layer, while the second is a parameter-free heuristic that selects the compression used at each layer by trying to mimic an ideal set of uncorrelated responses. Since PFA compresses networks based on the correlation of their responses we show in our experiments that it gains the additional flexibility of adapting each architecture to a specific domain while compressing. PFA is evaluated against several architectures and datasets, and shows considerable compression rates without compromising accuracy, e.g., for VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, PFA achieves a compression rate of 8x, 3x, and 1.4x with an accuracy gain of 0.4%, 1.4% points, and 2.4% respectively. Our tests show that PFA is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches while removing adoption barriers thanks to its practical implementation, intuitive philosophy and ease of use.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, Deep neural network compression, spectral analysis, machine learning</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose to incorporate trellis coded quantizer (TCQ) into a deep learning based image compression framework. A soft-to-hard strategy is applied to allow for back propagation during training. We develop a simple image compression model that consists of three subnetworks (encoder, decoder and entropy estimation), and optimize all of the components in an end-to-end manner. We experiment on two high resolution image datasets and both show that our model can achieve superior performance at low bit rates. We also show the comparisons between TCQ and SQ based on our proposed baseline model and demonstrate the advantage of TCQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2020</p></details> |

We consider the problem of finding optimal weights and show that the weight optimization leads to a strictly convex (and thus, good-natured) optimization problem. Finally, an experimental evaluation compares the two presented mixture techniques for a binary alphabet.

Our results build on expert stochastic context-free grammar models of RNA secondary structures (Dowell & Eddy, BMC Bioinformatics, 2004; Nebel & Scheid, Theory in Biosciences, 2011) combined with different (static and adaptive) models for rule probabilities and arithmetic coding.

These foundation models, when pre-trained on billion-scale datasets, are effective for various downstream tasks with little or no further training. A natural question to ask is how such models may be adapted for image compression. We investigate several techniques in which the pre-trained models can be directly used to implement compression schemes targeting novel low rate regimes. We show how text descriptions can be used in conjunction with side information to generate high-fidelity reconstructions that preserve both semantics and spatial structure of the original. We demonstrate that at very low bit-rates, our method can significantly improve upon learned compressors in terms of perceptual and semantic fidelity, despite no end-to-end training.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023 Neural Compression Workshop</p></details> |

We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/lil-lab/simple-context-compression</p></details> |

In addition, a symmetric auto-encoder is often used as a normal architecture for both motion and residual coding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that handles the drawbacks of the two typical above-mentioned architectures, we call it kernel-based motion-free video coding. The advantages of the motion-free approach are twofold: it improves the coding efficiency of the network and significantly reduces computational complexity thanks to eliminating motion estimation, motion compensation, and motion coding which are the most time-consuming engines. In addition, the kernel-based auto-encoder alleviates blur artifacts that usually occur with the conventional symmetric autoencoder. Consequently, it improves the visual quality of the reconstructed frames. Experimental results show the proposed framework outperforms the SOTA deep neural video compression networks on the HEVC-class B dataset and is competitive on the UVG and MCL-JCV datasets. In addition, it generates high-quality reconstructed frames in comparison with conventional motion coding-based symmetric auto-encoder meanwhile its model size is much smaller than that of the motion-based networks around three to four times.</p></details> | <details><summary>Deep ...</summary><p>Deep Neural Video Compression</p></details> |

Some model compression methods have been successfully applied to image classification and detection or language models, but there has been very little work compressing generative adversarial networks (GANs) performing complex tasks. In this paper, we show that a standard model compression technique, weight pruning, cannot be applied to GANs using existing methods. We then develop a self-supervised compression technique which uses the trained discriminator to supervise the training of a compressed generator.

Recent advances in computing power together with the availability of large training data sets has increased interest in the application of deep learning cnns to address image recognition and image processing tasks. Here, we present a powerful cnn tailored to the specific task of semantic image understanding to achieve higher visual quality in lossy compression. A modest increase in complexity is incorporated to the encoder which allows a standard, off-the-shelf jpeg decoder to be used. While jpeg encoding may be optimized for generic images, the process is ultimately unaware of the specific content of the image to be compressed. Our technique makes jpeg content-aware by designing and training a model to identify multiple semantic regions in a given image. Unlike object detection techniques, our model does not require labeling of object positions and is able to identify objects in a single pass. We present a new cnn architecture directed specifically to image compression, which generates a map that highlights semantically-salient regions so that they can be encoded at higher quality as compared to background regions. By adding a complete set of features for every class, and then taking a threshold over the sum of all feature activations, we generate a map that highlights semantically-salient regions so that they can be encoded at a better quality compared to background regions. Experiments are presented on the Kodak PhotoCD dataset and the MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset, in which our algorithm achieves higher visual quality for the same compressed size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Data Compression Conference, 11 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

At encoder side, we fine-tune a pre-trained artifact removal network on target data by using a compression objective applied on the weight-update. In particular, the compression objective encourages weight-updates which are sparse and closer to quantized values. This way, the final weight-update can be compressed more efficiently by pruning and quantization, and can be included into the encoded bitstream together with the image bitstream of a traditional codec. We show that this approach achieves reconstruction quality which is on-par or slightly superior to a traditional codec, at comparable bitrates.

| **[PivotCompress: Compression by Sorting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.5127v2)** | 2014-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sorted data is usually easier to compress than unsorted permutations of the same data. This motivates a simple compression scheme: specify the sorted permutation of the data along with a representation of the sorted data compressed recursively. The sorted permutation can be specified by recording the decisions made by quicksort. If the size of the data is known, then the quicksort decisions describe the data at a rate that is nearly as efficient as the minimal prefix-free code for the distribution, which is bounded by the entropy of the distribution. This is possible even though the distribution is unknown ahead of time. Used in this way, quicksort acts as a universal code in that it is asymptotically optimal for any stationary source. The Shannon entropy is a lower bound when describing stochastic, independent symbols. However, it is possible to encode non-uniform, finite strings below the entropy of the sample distribution by also encoding symbol counts because the values in the sequence are no longer independent once the counts are known. The key insight is that sparse quicksort comparison vectors can also be compressed to achieve an even lower rate when data is highly non-uniform while incurring only a modest penalty when data is random.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, compression by sorting, quicksort as universal code; this version describes the permutation vector and its inverse</p></details> |

Specifically, we obtain a lossy reconstruction of the raw image through lossy image compression and uniformly quantize the corresponding residual to satisfy a given tight $\ell_\infty$ error bound. Suppose that the error bound is zero, i.e., lossless image compression, we formulate the joint optimization problem of compressing both the lossy image and the original residual in terms of variational auto-encoders and solve it with end-to-end training. To achieve scalable compression with the error bound larger than zero, we derive the probability model of the quantized residual by quantizing the learned probability model of the original residual, instead of training multiple networks. We further correct the bias of the derived probability model caused by the context mismatch between training and inference. Finally, the quantized residual is encoded according to the bias-corrected probability model and is concatenated with the bitstream of the compressed lossy image. Experimental results demonstrate that our near-lossless codec achieves the state-of-the-art performance for lossless and near-lossless image compression, and achieves competitive PSNR while much smaller $\ell_\infty$ error compared with lossy image codecs at high bit rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2021; Code: https://github.com/BYchao100/Scalable-Near-lossless-Image-Compression</p></details> |

We propose and analyze a new algorithm that performs bidirectional compression and achieves the same convergence rate as algorithms using only uplink (from the local workers to the central server) compression. To obtain this improvement, we design MCM, an algorithm such that the downlink compression only impacts local models, while the global model is preserved. As a result, and contrary to previous works, the gradients on local servers are computed on perturbed models. Consequently, convergence proofs are more challenging and require a precise control of this perturbation. To ensure it, MCM additionally combines model compression with a memory mechanism. This analysis opens new doors, e.g. incorporating worker dependent randomized-models and partial participation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Bidir...</summary><p>Bidirectional compression for Federated Learning: 59 pages, 5 theorems, published at NeurIPS 2021</p></details> |
| **[Touché: Towards Ideal and Efficient Cache Compression By Mitigating Tag Area Overheads](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.00553v1)** | 2021-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compression is seen as a simple technique to increase the effective cache capacity. Unfortunately, compression techniques either incur tag area overheads or restrict data placement to only include neighboring compressed cache blocks to mitigate tag area overheads. Ideally, we should be able to place arbitrary compressed cache blocks without any placement restrictions and tag area overheads. This paper proposes Touché, a framework that enables storing multiple arbitrary compressed cache blocks within a physical cacheline without any tag area overheads. The Touché framework consists of three components. The first component, called the ``Signature'' (SIGN) engine, creates shortened signatures from the tag addresses of compressed blocks. Due to this, the SIGN engine can store multiple signatures in each tag entry. On a cache access, the physical cacheline is accessed only if there is a signature match (which has a negligible probability of false positive). The second component, called the ``Tag Appended Data'' (TADA) mechanism, stores the full tag addresses with data. TADA enables Touché to detect false positive signature matches by ensuring that the actual tag address is available for comparison. The third component, called the ``Superblock Marker'' (SMARK) mechanism, uses a unique marker in the tag entry to indicate the occurrence of compressed cache blocks from neighboring physical addresses in the same cacheline. Touché is completely hardware-based and achieves an average speedup of 12\% (ideal 13\%) when compared to an uncompressed baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Compression, Caches, Tag Array, Data Array, Hashing</p></details> |
| **[Towards End-to-End Image Compression and Analysis with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09300v1)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an end-to-end image compression and analysis model with Transformers, targeting to the cloud-based image classification application. Instead of placing an existing Transformer-based image classification model directly after an image codec, we aim to redesign the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to perform image classification from the compressed features and facilitate image compression with the long-term information from the Transformer. Specifically, we first replace the patchify stem (i.e., image splitting and embedding) of the ViT model with a lightweight image encoder modelled by a convolutional neural network. The compressed features generated by the image encoder are injected convolutional inductive bias and are fed to the Transformer for image classification bypassing image reconstruction. Meanwhile, we propose a feature aggregation module to fuse the compressed features with the selected intermediate features of the Transformer, and feed the aggregated features to a deconvolutional neural network for image reconstruction. The aggregated features can obtain the long-term information from the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and improve the compression performance. The rate-distortion-accuracy optimization problem is finally solved by a two-step training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both the image compression and the classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2022; Code: https://github.com/BYchao100/Towards-Image-Compression-and-Analysis-with-Transformers</p></details> |
| **[Supervised Compression for Resource-Constrained Edge Computing Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11898v3)** | 2022-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been much interest in deploying deep learning algorithms on low-powered devices, including smartphones, drones, and medical sensors. However, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in terms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning operation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is compressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to transmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular approach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while compressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing strategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression baselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This paper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to compress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised compression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic bottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding (Entropic Student). We compare our approach to various neural image and feature compression baselines in three vision tasks and found that it achieves better supervised rate-distortion performance while maintaining smaller end-to-end latency. We furthermore show that the learned feature representations can be tuned to serve multiple downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2022.

We construct a generic approximate sample compression scheme for real-valued function classes exhibiting exponential size in the fat-shattering dimension but independent of the sample size. Notably, for linear regression, an approximate compression of size linear in the dimension is constructed. Moreover, for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ losses, we can even exhibit an efficient exact sample compression scheme of size linear in the dimension. We further show that for every other $\ell_p$ loss, $p\in (1,\infty)$, there does not exist an exact agnostic compression scheme of bounded size. This refines and generalizes a negative result of David, Moran, and Yehudayoff for the $\ell_2$ loss. We close by posing general open questions: for agnostic regression with $\ell_1$ loss, does every function class admits an exact compression scheme of size equal to its pseudo-dimension? For the $\ell_2$ loss, does every function class admit an approximate compression scheme of polynomial size in the fat-shattering dimension? These questions generalize Warmuth's classic sample compression conjecture for realizable-case classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>New r...</summary><p>New results in this version: (1) Approximate agnostic sample compression scheme for function classes with finite fat-shattering dimension and the $\ell_p$ loss (section 3), (2) Near-optimal approximate compression for linear functions and the $\ell_p$ loss (section 4.1) The results in sections 4.2 and 4.3 appear in the previous version</p></details> |

Graphs can capture the relationship among data in an efficient way, and have been widely used. In recent times, with the advent of Big Data, there has been a need to store and compute on large data sets efficiently. However, considering the size of the data sets in question, finding optimal methods to store and process the data has been a challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we study different graph compression techniques and propose novel algorithms to do the same. Specifically, given a graph G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, and |V| = n, we propose techniques to compress the adjacency matrix representation of the graph. Our algorithms are based on finding patterns within the adjacency matrix data, and replacing the common patterns with specific markers. All the techniques proposed here are lossless compression of graphs. Based on the experimental results, it is observed that our proposed techniques achieve almost 70% compression as compared to adjacency matrix representation. The results show that large graphs can be efficiently stored in smaller memory and exploit the parallel processing power of compute nodes as well as efficiently transfer data between resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is mainly about compression can be achieved in a adjacency matrix used to store a graph</p></details> |

To reduce the compression artifacts of HEVC, we propose a DenseNet based approach as the in-loop filter of HEVC, which leverages multiple adjacent frames to enhance the quality of each encoded frame. Specifically, the higher-quality frames are found by a reference frame selector (RFS). Then, a deep neural network for multi-frame in-loop filter (named MIF-Net) is developed to enhance the quality of each encoded frame by utilizing the spatial information of this frame and the temporal information of its neighboring higher-quality frames. The MIF-Net is built on the recently developed DenseNet, benefiting from the improved generalization capacity and computational efficiency. Finally, experimental results verify the effectiveness of our multi-frame in-loop filter, outperforming the HM baseline and other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures.

With increasing amounts of data consumed by machines rather than humans, a new paradigm of machine-oriented compression$\unicode{x2013}$which prioritizes the retention of features salient for machine perception over traditional human-centric criteria$\unicode{x2013}$has emerged, creating several new challenges to the development, evaluation, and deployment of systems utilizing lossy compression. In particular, it is unclear how different approaches to lossy compression will affect the performance of downstream machine perception tasks. To address this under-explored area, we evaluate various perception models$\unicode{x2013}$including image classification, image segmentation, speech recognition, and music source separation$\unicode{x2013}$under severe lossy compression. We utilize several popular codecs spanning conventional, neural, and generative compression architectures. Our results indicate three key findings: (1) using generative compression, it is feasible to leverage highly compressed data while incurring a negligible impact on machine perceptual quality; (2) machine perceptual quality correlates strongly with deep similarity metrics, indicating a crucial role of these metrics in the development of machine-oriented codecs; and (3) using lossy compressed datasets, (e.g. ImageNet) for pre-training can lead to counter-intuitive scenarios where lossy compression increases machine perceptual quality rather than degrading it.

The proposed decomposition solves an $n$-$\ell_1$ cluster-weighted minimization to decompose a sequence of frames (or vectors), into sparse and low-rank components, from compressive measurements. Our method processes a data vector of the stream per time instance from a small number of measurements in contrast to conventional batch RPCA, which needs to access full data. The $n$-$\ell_1$ cluster-weighted minimization leverages the sparse components along with their correlations with multiple previously-recovered sparse vectors. Moreover, the proposed minimization can exploit the structures of sparse components via clustering and re-weighting iteratively.

While, so far, research has mainly focused on architecture and model improvements, in this work we explore content adaptive optimization. To this end, we introduce an iterative procedure which adapts the latent representation to the specific content we wish to compress while keeping the parameters of the network and the predictive model fixed. Our experiments show that this allows for an overall increase in rate-distortion performance, independently of the specific architecture used. Furthermore, we also evaluate this strategy in the context of adapting a pretrained network to other content that is different in visual appearance or resolution. Here, our experiments show that our adaptation strategy can largely close the gap as compared to models specifically trained for the given content while having the benefit that no additional data in the form of model parameter updates has to be transmitted.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR Workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression (2019)</p></details> |

Ideally, 3D point clouds endeavor to depict object/scene surfaces that are continuous. Practically, as a set of discrete samples, point clouds are locally disconnected and sparsely distributed. This sparse nature is hindering the discovery of local correlation among points for compression. Motivated by an analysis with fractal dimension, we propose a heterogeneous approach with deep learning for lossy point cloud geometry compression. On top of a base layer compressing a coarse representation of the input, an enhancement layer is designed to cope with the challenging geometric residual/details. Specifically, a point-based network is applied to convert the erratic local details to latent features residing on the coarse point cloud. Then a sparse convolutional neural network operating on the coarse point cloud is launched. It utilizes the continuity/smoothness of the coarse geometry to compress the latent features as an enhancement bit-stream that greatly benefits the reconstruction quality. When this bit-stream is unavailable, e.g., due to packet loss, we support a skip mode with the same architecture which generates geometric details from the coarse point cloud directly. Experimentation on both dense and sparse point clouds demonstrate the state-of-the-art compression performance achieved by our proposal.

The core technology of VP relies on high-resolution, high-brightness LED panels to playback/render video content. There are a number of technical challenges to effective deployment e.g. image tile synchronisation across the panels, cross panel colour balancing and compensating for colour fluctuations due to changes in camera angles. Given the complexity and potential quality degradation, the industry prefers "pristine" or lossless compressed source material for displays, which requires significant storage and bandwidth. Modern lossy compression standards like AV1 or H.265 could maintain the same quality at significantly lower bitrates and resource demands. There is yet no agreed methodology for assessing the impact of these standards on quality when the VP scene is recorded in-camera. We present a methodology to assess this impact by comparing lossless and lossy compressed footage displayed through VP screens and recorded in-camera. We assess the quality impact of HAP/NotchLC/Daniel2 and AV1/HEVC/H.264 compression bitrates from 2 Mb/s to 2000 Mb/s with various GOP sizes. Several perceptual quality metrics are then used to automatically evaluate in-camera picture quality, referencing the original uncompressed source content through the LED wall. Our results show that we can achieve the same quality with hybrid codecs as with intermediate encoders at orders of magnitude less bitrate and storage requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>SMPTE...</summary><p>SMPTE Media Summit Paper on use of Compression in Virtual Production from TCD and Disguise</p></details> |
| **[Lossy Compression with Distortion Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04064v1)** | 2020-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When training end-to-end learned models for lossy compression, one has to balance the rate and distortion losses. This is typically done by manually setting a tradeoff parameter $β$, an approach called $β$-VAE. Using this approach it is difficult to target a specific rate or distortion value, because the result can be very sensitive to $β$, and the appropriate value for $β$ depends on the model and problem setup. As a result, model comparison requires extensive per-model $β$-tuning, and producing a whole rate-distortion curve (by varying $β$) for each model to be compared. We argue that the constrained optimization method of Rezende and Viola, 2018 is a lot more appropriate for training lossy compression models because it allows us to obtain the best possible rate subject to a distortion constraint. This enables pointwise model comparisons, by training two models with the same distortion target and comparing their rate. We show that the method does manage to satisfy the constraint on a realistic image compression task, outperforms a constrained optimization method based on a hinge-loss, and is more practical to use for model selection than a $β$-VAE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a CVPR 2020 workshop paper: Workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC)</p></details> |

Commercially deployed systems during the period could compress 4,096 x 4,096 sized images at 12 bpp to 2 bpp using lossless arithmetic coding, and over the years JPEG and JPEG2000 were imbibed reaching upto 0.1 bpp. Inspired by the reprise of deep learning based compression for natural images over the last two years, we propose a fully convolutional autoencoder for diagnostically relevant feature preserving lossy compression. This is followed by leveraging arithmetic coding for encapsulating high redundancy of features for further high-density code packing leading to variable bit length. We demonstrate performance on two different publicly available digital mammography datasets using peak signal-to-noise ratio (pSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) index and domain adaptability tests between datasets.

However, despite the fact biased compressors often show superior performance in practice when compared to the much more studied and understood unbiased compressors, very little is known about them. In this work we study three classes of biased compression operators, two of which are new, and their performance when applied to (stochastic) gradient descent and distributed (stochastic) gradient descent. We show for the first time that biased compressors can lead to linear convergence rates both in the single node and distributed settings. We prove that distributed compressed SGD method, employed with error feedback mechanism, enjoys the ergodic rate $O\left( δL \exp \left[-\frac{μK}{δL}\right] + \frac{(C + δD)}{Kμ}\right)$, where $δ\ge 1$ is a compression parameter which grows when more compression is applied, $L$ and $μ$ are the smoothness and strong convexity constants, $C$ captures stochastic gradient noise ($C=0$ if full gradients are computed on each node) and $D$ captures the variance of the gradients at the optimum ($D=0$ for over-parameterized models). Further, via a theoretical study of several synthetic and empirical distributions of communicated gradients, we shed light on why and by how much biased compressors outperform their unbiased variants. Finally, we propose several new biased compressors with promising theoretical guarantees and practical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables, 22 theorems and lemmas, 7 new compression operators, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

FOLCA enables a direct encoding of an SLP into a succinct representation that is asymptotically equivalent to an information theoretic lower bound for representing an SLP (Maruyama et al., SPIRE'13). The compression of FOLCA takes linear time proportional to the length of an input text and its working space depends only on the size of the SLP, which enables us to apply FOLCA to large-scale repetitive texts. Recent repetitive texts, however, include some noise. For example, current sequencing technology has significant error rates, which embeds noise into genome sequences. For such noisy repetitive texts, FOLCA working in the SLP size consumes a large amount of memory. We present two variants of FOLCA working in constant space by leveraging the idea behind stream mining techniques. Experiments using 100 human genomes corresponding to about 300GB from the 1000 human genomes project revealed the applicability of our method to large-scale, noisy repetitive texts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a proceeding accepted to Data Compression Conference (DCC), 2014</p></details> |

However, most works focus on dimension-wise compression that transforms high-dimensional features into a low-dimensional space. In this paper, we propose circular convolution-based batch-wise compression for SL (C3-SL) to compress multiple features into one single feature. To avoid information loss while merging multiple features, we exploit the quasi-orthogonality of features in high-dimensional space with circular convolution and superposition. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the potential of batch-wise compression under the SL scenario. Based on the simulation results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our method achieves a 16x compression ratio with negligible accuracy drops compared with the vanilla SL. Moreover, C3-SL significantly reduces 1152x memory and 2.25x computation overhead compared to the state-of-the-art dimension-wise compression method.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, IEEE MLSP 2022, Github: https://github.com/WesleyHsieh0806/Split-Learning-Compression</p></details> |

Earlier methods built a well-designed pipeline, and efforts were made to improve all modules of the pipeline by handcrafted tuning. Later, tremendous contributions were made, especially when data-driven methods revitalized the domain with their excellent modeling capacities and flexibility in incorporating newly designed modules and constraints. Despite great progress, a systematic benchmark and comprehensive analysis of end-to-end learned image compression methods are lacking. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive literature survey of learned image compression methods. The literature is organized based on several aspects to jointly optimize the rate-distortion performance with a neural network, i.e., network architecture, entropy model and rate control. We describe milestones in cutting-edge learned image-compression methods, review a broad range of existing works, and provide insights into their historical development routes. With this survey, the main challenges of image compression methods are revealed, along with opportunities to address the related issues with recent advanced learning methods. This analysis provides an opportunity to take a further step towards higher-efficiency image compression. By introducing a coarse-to-fine hyperprior model for entropy estimation and signal reconstruction, we achieve improved rate-distortion performance, especially on high-resolution images. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model in rate-distortion performance and time complexity on multi-core CPUs and GPUs.

| **[L-LBVC: Long-Term Motion Estimation and Prediction for Learned Bi-Directional Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02560v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, learned video compression (LVC) has shown superior performance under low-delay configuration. However, the performance of learned bi-directional video compression (LBVC) still lags behind traditional bi-directional coding. The performance gap mainly arises from inaccurate long-term motion estimation and prediction of distant frames, especially in large motion scenes. To solve these two critical problems, this paper proposes a novel LBVC framework, namely L-LBVC. Firstly, we propose an adaptive motion estimation module that can handle both short-term and long-term motions. Specifically, we directly estimate the optical flows for adjacent frames and non-adjacent frames with small motions. For non-adjacent frames with large motions, we recursively accumulate local flows between adjacent frames to estimate long-term flows. Secondly, we propose an adaptive motion prediction module that can largely reduce the bit cost for motion coding. To improve the accuracy of long-term motion prediction, we adaptively downsample reference frames during testing to match the motion ranges observed during training. Experiments show that our L-LBVC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art LVC methods and even surpasses VVC (VTM) on some test datasets under random access configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 Data Compression Conference (DCC)</p></details> |
| **[Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19147v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on scaling model parameters. However, as hardware limits constrain further model growth, the primary computational bottleneck has shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long sequences by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position data-centric compression as the emerging paradigm, which improves AI efficiency by directly compressing the volume of data processed during model training or inference. To formalize this shift, we establish a unified framework for existing efficiency strategies and demonstrate why it constitutes a crucial paradigm change for long-context AI. We then systematically review the landscape of data-centric compression methods, analyzing their benefits across diverse scenarios. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising future research directions. Our work aims to provide a novel perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing efforts, and catalyze innovation to address the challenges posed by ever-increasing context lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: \url{https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/Awesome-Token-level-Model-Compression}</p></details> |
| **[Channel Simulation and Coded Source Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06071v2)** | 2019-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded source compression, also known as source compression with helpers, has been a major variant of distributed source compression, but has hitherto received little attention in the quantum regime. This work treats and solves the corresponding quantum coded source compression through an observation that connects coded source compression with channel simulation. First, we consider classical source coding with quantum side information where the quantum side information is observed by a helper and sent to the decoder via a classical channel. We derive a single-letter characterization of the achievable rate region for this problem. The direct coding theorem of our result is proved via the measurement compression theory of Winter, a quantum-to-classical channel simulation. Our result reveals that a helper's scheme which separately conducts a measurement and a compression is suboptimal, and measurement compression seems necessary to achieve the optimal rate region. We then study coded source compression in the fully quantum regime, where two different scenarios are considered depending on the types of communication channels between the legitimate source and the receiver. We further allow entanglement assistance from the quantum helper in both scenarios. We characterize the involved quantum resources, and derive single-letter expressions of the achievable rate region. The direct coding proofs are based on well-known quantum protocols, the quantum state merging protocol and the fully quantum Slepian-Wolf protocol, together with the quantum reverse Shannon theorem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published version. The manuscript is a combination of results in arXiv:1501.04366 and arXiv:1504.05227.

| **[Color Image Compression Based On Wavelet Packet Best Tree](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.3276v1)** | 2010-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Image Compression, the researchers' aim is to reduce the number of bits required to represent an image by removing the spatial and spectral redundancies. Recently discrete wavelet transform and wavelet packet has emerged as popular techniques for image compression. The wavelet transform is one of the major processing components of image compression. The result of the compression changes as per the basis and tap of the wavelet used. It is proposed that proper selection of mother wavelet on the basis of nature of images, improve the quality as well as compression ratio remarkably. We suggest the novel technique, which is based on wavelet packet best tree based on Threshold Entropy with enhanced run-length encoding. This method reduces the time complexity of wavelet packets decomposition as complete tree is not decomposed. Our algorithm selects the sub-bands, which include significant information based on threshold entropy. The enhanced run length encoding technique is suggested provides better results than RLE. The result when compared with JPEG-2000 proves to be better.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Journal of Computer Science Issues online at http://ijcsi.org/articles/Color-Image-Compression-Based-On-Wavelet-Packet-Best-Tree.php</p></details> |
| **[Strong Converse Bounds for Compression of Mixed States](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09415v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study strong converse properties for both visible and blind compression of mixed states. The optimal rate of a visible compression scheme is obtained in terms of the entanglement of purification, whose additivity remains unknown so far. For a variation of extendible states, we prove that the entanglement of purification is additive and apply this to obtain a "pretty strong" converse bound for the blind and visible compression of such states. Namely, when the rate decreases below the optimal rate, the error exhibits a discontinuous jump from 0 to at least $\frac{1}{3\sqrt{2}}$. To deal with the visible case for general states, we define a new quantity $E_{α,p}(A:R)_ρ$ for a bipartite state $ρ^{AR}$ and $α\in (0,1)\cup (1,\infty)$ as the $α$-Rényi generalization of the entanglement of purification $E_{p}(A:R)_ρ$. For $α=1$, we define $E_{1,p}(A:R)_ρ:=E_{p}(A:R)_ρ$. We show that for any rate below the regularization $\lim_{α\to 1^+}E_{α,p}^{\infty}(A:R)_ρ:=\lim_{α\to 1^+} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{E_{α,p}(A^n:R^n)_{ρ^{\otimes n}}}{n}$ the fidelity for the visible compression exponentially converges to zero. Moreover, we consider blind compression of a general mixed-state source $ρ^{AR}$ shared between an encoder and an inaccessible reference system $R$. We obtain a strong converse bound for the compression of this source by assuming that the decoder is a super-unital channel. This immediately implies a strong converse for the blind compression of ensembles of mixed states, by assuming a super-unital decoder, as this is a special case of the general mixed-state source $ρ^{AR}$ where the reference system $R$ has a classical structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2 in...</summary><p>v2 includes new results in Section III on compression of partially exchangeable states. Theorem 15 provides a new proof of the strong converse bound for blind compression, valid for all sub-unital decoders. v1 has an error in Lemma 14: the fidelity bound on p.14 fails in general. Thus, Theorem 3 applies only to isometric decoders</p></details> |

However, quantization introduces errors in the compression process, which can degrade the quality of the compressed image. Existing approaches address the train-test mismatch problem incurred during quantization, the random impact of quantization on the expressiveness of image features is still unsolved. This paper presents a novel quantization rectifier (QR) method for image compression that leverages image feature correlation to mitigate the impact of quantization. Our method designs a neural network architecture that predicts unquantized features from the quantized ones, preserving feature expressiveness for better image reconstruction quality. We develop a soft-to-predictive training technique to integrate QR into existing neural image codecs. In evaluation, we integrate QR into state-of-the-art neural image codecs and compare enhanced models and baselines on the widely-used Kodak benchmark. The results show consistent coding efficiency improvement by QR with a negligible increase in the running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Neural Compression Workshop 2023, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

| **[Adaptive and Scalable Compression of Multispectral Images using VVC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04117v1)** | 2023-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The VVC codec is applied to the task of multispectral image (MSI) compression using adaptive and scalable coding structures. In a 'plain' VVC approach, concepts from picture-to-picture temporal prediction are employed for decorrelation along the MSI's spectral dimension. The popular principle component analysis (PCA) for spectral decorrelation is further evaluated in combination with VVC intra-coding for spatial decorrelation. This approach is referred to as PCA-VVC. A novel adaptive MSI compression algorithm, named HPCLS, is introduced, that uses PCA and inter-prediction for spectral and VVC intra-coding for spatial decorrelation. Further, a novel adaptive scalable approach is proposed, that provides a separately decodable spectrally scaled preview of the MSI in the compressed file. Information contained in the preview is exploited in order to reduce the overall file size. All schemes are evaluated on images from the ARAD HS data set containing outdoor scenes with a high variety in brightness and color. We found that 'Plain' VVC is outperformed by both PCA-VVC and HPCLS. HPCLS shows advantageous rate-distortion (RD) behavior compared to PCA-VVC for reconstruction quality above 51dB PSNR. The performance of the scalable approach is compared to the combination of an independent RGB preview and one of HPCLS or PCA-VVC. The scalable approach shows significant benefit especially at higher preview qualities.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, accepted as poster at Data Compression Conference 2023</p></details> |

So high-resolution videos need to be downsampled for compression. In order to solve the problem of video coding at different resolutions, we propose a rate-guided arbitrary rescaling network (RARN) for video resizing before encoding. To help the RARN be compatible with standard codecs and generate compression-friendly results, an iteratively optimized transformer-based virtual codec (TVC) is introduced to simulate the key components of video encoding and perform bitrate estimation. By iteratively training the TVC and the RARN, we achieved 5%-29% BD-Rate reduction anchored by linear interpolation under different encoding configurations and resolutions, exceeding the previous methods on most test videos. Furthermore, the lightweight RARN structure can process FHD (1080p) content at real-time speed (91 FPS) and obtain a considerable rate reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a one-page poster by 2023 Data Compression Conference (DCC).

Besides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly related, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to another. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations. The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in regular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and similar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically related to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly transformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove that in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the root of a zerotree, or its branch. The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients as a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of a multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This interpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression techniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view predictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer prediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a full paper submitted to Data Compression Conference '96; 10 pages; The abstract of this paper was published in Proc.

However, they suffer orders of magnitude higher computational complexity compared to traditional codecs, which hinders their real-world deployment. This paper takes a step forward towards closing this gap in decoding complexity by using a shallow or even linear decoding transform resembling that of JPEG. To compensate for the resulting drop in compression performance, we exploit the often asymmetrical computation budget between encoding and decoding, by adopting more powerful encoder networks and iterative encoding. We theoretically formalize the intuition behind, and our experimental results establish a new frontier in the trade-off between rate-distortion and decoding complexity for neural image compression. Specifically, we achieve rate-distortion performance competitive with the established mean-scale hyperprior architecture of Minnen et al. (2018) at less than 50K decoding FLOPs/pixel, reducing the baseline's overall decoding complexity by 80%, or over 90% for the synthesis transform alone.

This substantially improves on the currently best known bound on the size of sample compression schemes (due to Moran and Yehudayoff), which is exponential in $\VCD$. The long-standing open question whether the smallest size of a sample compression scheme is in $O(\VCD)$ remains unresolved, but our results show that research on machine teaching is a promising avenue for the study of this open problem.

Super-Resolution (SR) techniques are often employed on these terminals as an efficient way to reduce the required bit-rate bandwidth for cloud gaming. However, insufficient attention has been paid to SR of compressed game video content. Most SR networks amplify block artifacts and ringing effects in decoded frames while ignoring edge details of game content, leading to unsatisfactory reconstruction results. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight network called Coding Prior-Guided Super-Resolution (CPGSR) to address the SR challenges in compressed game video content. First, we design a Compressed Domain Guided Block (CDGB) to extract features of different depths from coding priors, which are subsequently integrated with features from the U-net backbone. Then, a series of re-parameterization blocks are utilized for reconstruction. Ultimately, inspired by the quantization in video coding, we propose a partitioned focal frequency loss to effectively guide the model's focus on preserving high-frequency information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, Data Compression Conference2025</p></details> |

Efficiently capturing these contexts within a single entropy model, especially in high-resolution image coding, presents a challenge due to the computational complexity of existing global context modules. To address this challenge, we propose the Linear Complexity Multi-Reference Entropy Model (MEM$^{++}$). Specifically, the latent representation is partitioned into multiple slices. For channel-wise contexts, previously compressed slices serve as the context for compressing a particular slice. For local contexts, we introduce a shifted-window-based checkerboard attention module. This module ensures linear complexity without sacrificing performance. For global contexts, we propose a linear complexity attention mechanism. It captures global correlations by decomposing the softmax operation, enabling the implicit computation of attention maps from previously decoded slices. Using MEM$^{++}$ as the entropy model, we develop the image compression method MLIC$^{++}$. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MLIC$^{++}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing BD-rate by $13.39\%$ on the Kodak dataset compared to VTM-17.0 in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Furthermore, MLIC$^{++}$ exhibits linear computational complexity and memory consumption with resolution, making it highly suitable for high-resolution image coding.

Conventional wisdom suggests that not everyone can be an attacker since the process of designing the trigger generation algorithm often involves significant effort and extensive experimentation to ensure the attack's stealthiness and effectiveness. Alternatively, this paper shows that there exists a more severe backdoor threat: anyone can exploit an easily-accessible algorithm for silent backdoor attacks. Specifically, this attacker can employ the widely-used lossy image compression from a plethora of compression tools to effortlessly inject a trigger pattern into an image without leaving any noticeable trace; i.e., the generated triggers are natural artifacts. One does not require extensive knowledge to click on the "convert" or "save as" button while using tools for lossy image compression. Via this attack, the adversary does not need to design a trigger generator as seen in prior works and only requires poisoning the data. Empirically, the proposed attack consistently achieves 100% attack success rate in several benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, GTSRB and CelebA. More significantly, the proposed attack can still achieve almost 100% attack success rate with very small (approximately 10%) poisoning rates in the clean label setting. The generated trigger of the proposed attack using one lossy compression algorithm is also transferable across other related compression algorithms, exacerbating the severity of this backdoor threat. This work takes another crucial step toward understanding the extensive risks of backdoor attacks in practice, urging practitioners to investigate similar attacks and relevant backdoor mitigation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages.

By learning continuous SDFs in 3D space, neural networks can predict the distance from a given query space point to its closest object surface,whose positive and negative signs denote inside and outside of the object, respectively. Training a specific network for each 3D model, which individually embeds its shape, can realize compressed representation of objects by storing fewer network (and possibly latent) parameters. Consequently, reconstruction through network inference and surface recovery can be achieved. In this paper, we propose an SDF prediction network using explicit key spheres as input. Key spheres are extracted from the internal space of objects, whose centers either have relatively larger SDF values (sphere radii), or are located at essential positions. By inputting the spatial information of multiple spheres which imply different local shapes, the proposed method can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy with a negligible storage cost. Compared to previous works, our method achieves the high-fidelity and high-compression 3D object coding and reconstruction. Experiments conducted on three datasets verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2022 as a full paper</p></details> |

In this work, we tackle the problem of adapting a pre-trained model to multiple target domains by plugging into the decoder an adapter module for each of them, including the source one. Each adapter improves the decoder performance on a specific domain, without the model forgetting about the images seen at training time. A gate network computes the weights to optimally blend the contributions from the adapters when the bitstream is decoded. We experimentally validate our method over two state-of-the-art pre-trained models, observing improved rate-distortion efficiency on the target domains without penalties on the source domain. Furthermore, the gate's ability to find similarities with the learned target domains enables better encoding efficiency also for images outside them.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, published to Data compression conference 2024 (DCC2024)</p></details> |

To remove correlation without increasing noise, a reversible denoising and lifting step (RDLS) was proposed that integrates denoising filters into LS. Applying RDLS to color space transformation results in a new image component transformation that is perfectly reversible despite involving the inherently irreversible denoising; the first application of such a transformation is presented in this paper. For the JPEG-LS, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR standard algorithms in lossless mode, the application of RDLS to the RDgDb color space transformation with simple denoising filters is especially effective for images in the native optical resolution of acquisition devices. It results in improving compression ratios of all those images in cases when unmodified color space transformation either improves or worsens ratios compared with the untransformed image. The average improvement is 5.0-6.0\% for two out of the three sets of such images, whereas average ratios of images from standard test-sets are improved by up to 2.2\%. For the efficient image-adaptive determination of filters for RDLS, a couple of fast entropy-based estimators of compression effects that may be used independently of the actual compression algorithm are investigated and an immediate filter selection method based on the detector precision characteristic model driven by image acquisition parameters is introduced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Reversible color space transformation; Lifting technique; Denoising; Reversible denoising and lifting step; Detector precision characteristic; Lossless image compression</p></details> |

At this level of quality, distinguishing between compressed and original content becomes difficult, highlighting the need for assessment methodologies that are sensitive to even the smallest visual quality differences. Conventional subjective visual quality assessments often use absolute category rating scales, ranging from ``excellent'' to ``bad''. While suitable for evaluating more pronounced distortions, these scales are inadequate for detecting subtle visual differences. The JPEG standardization project AIC is currently developing a subjective image quality assessment methodology for high-fidelity images. This paper presents the proposed assessment methods, a dataset of high-quality compressed images, and their corresponding crowdsourced visual quality ratings. It also outlines a data analysis approach that reconstructs quality scale values in just noticeable difference (JND) units. The assessment method uses boosting techniques on visual stimuli to help observers detect compression artifacts more clearly. This is followed by a rescaling process that adjusts the boosted quality values back to the original perceptual scale. This reconstruction yields a fine-grained, high-precision quality scale in JND units, providing more informative results for practical applications. The dataset and code to reproduce the results will be available at https://github.com/jpeg-aic/dataset-BTC-PTC-24.</p></details> | <details><summary>Miche...</summary><p>Michela Testolina, Mohsen Jenadeleh contributed equally to this work, submitted to the Data Compression Conference (DCC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deep Gradient Compression: Reducing the Communication Bandwidth for Distributed Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01887v3)** | 2020-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale distributed training requires significant communication bandwidth for gradient exchange that limits the scalability of multi-node training, and requires expensive high-bandwidth network infrastructure. The situation gets even worse with distributed training on mobile devices (federated learning), which suffers from higher latency, lower throughput, and intermittent poor connections. In this paper, we find 99.9% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD is redundant, and propose Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) to greatly reduce the communication bandwidth. To preserve accuracy during compression, DGC employs four methods: momentum correction, local gradient clipping, momentum factor masking, and warm-up training. We have applied Deep Gradient Compression to image classification, speech recognition, and language modeling with multiple datasets including Cifar10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank, and Librispeech Corpus. On these scenarios, Deep Gradient Compression achieves a gradient compression ratio from 270x to 600x without losing accuracy, cutting the gradient size of ResNet-50 from 97MB to 0.35MB, and for DeepSpeech from 488MB to 0.74MB. Deep gradient compression enables large-scale distributed training on inexpensive commodity 1Gbps Ethernet and facilitates distributed training on mobile.

| **[FM-Delta: Fault Management Packet Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.08104v1)** | 2017-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault Management (FM) is a cardinal feature in communication networks. One of the most common FM approaches is to use periodic keepalive messages. Hence, switches and routers are required to transmit a large number of FM messages periodically, requiring a hardware-based packet generator that periodically transmits a set of messages that are stored in an expensive on-chip memory. With the rapid growth of carrier networks, and as 5G technologies emerge, the number of users and the traffic rates are expected to significantly increase over the next few years. Consequently, we expect the on-chip memories used for FM to become a costly component in switch and router chips. We introduce a novel approach in which FM messages are stored in compressed form in the on-chip memory, allowing to significantly reduce the memory size. We present FM-Delta, a simple hardware-friendly delta encoding algorithm that allows FM messages to be compressed by a factor of 2.6. We show that this compression ratio is very close to the results of the zlib compression library, which requires much higher implementation complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This technical report is an extended version of "FM-Delta: Fault Management Packet Compression", which was accepted to the IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management, IM 2017</p></details> |

For scenarios, where the data volume grows into terabytes and petabytes, keeping all the data in memory is exorbitantly expensive. Hence, the data is compressed efficiently using different algorithms to exploit the multi-core parallelization technologies for query processing. Several compression methods are studied for compressing the column array, post Dictionary Encoding. In this paper, we will present two novel optimizations in compression techniques - Block Size Optimized Cluster Encoding and Block Size Optimized Indirect Encoding - which perform better than their predecessors.

| **[Efficient Latency-Aware CNN Depth Compression via Two-Stage Dynamic Programming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.12187v2)** | 2023-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works on neural network pruning advocate that reducing the depth of the network is more effective in reducing run-time memory usage and accelerating inference latency than reducing the width of the network through channel pruning. In this regard, some recent works propose depth compression algorithms that merge convolution layers. However, the existing algorithms have a constricted search space and rely on human-engineered heuristics. In this paper, we propose a novel depth compression algorithm which targets general convolution operations. We propose a subset selection problem that replaces inefficient activation layers with identity functions and optimally merges consecutive convolution operations into shallow equivalent convolution operations for efficient end-to-end inference latency. Since the proposed subset selection problem is NP-hard, we formulate a surrogate optimization problem that can be solved exactly via two-stage dynamic programming within a few seconds. We evaluate our methods and baselines by TensorRT for a fair inference latency comparison. Our method outperforms the baseline method with higher accuracy and faster inference speed in MobileNetV2 on the ImageNet dataset. Specifically, we achieve $1.41\times$ speed-up with $0.11$\%p accuracy gain in MobileNetV2-1.0 on the ImageNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2023; Codes at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Efficient-CNN-Depth-Compression</p></details> |

Apart from a moderate-sized labeled data, L, the SS setting is characterized by an additional, much larger sized, unlabeled data, U. The setting of |U| >> |L|, makes SS inference unique and different from the standard missing data problems, owing to natural violation of the so-called "positivity" or "overlap" assumption. However, most of the SS literature implicitly assumes L and U to be equally distributed, i.e., no selection bias in the labeling. Inferential challenges in missing at random (MAR) type labeling allowing for selection bias, are inevitably exacerbated by the decaying nature of the propensity score (PS). We address this gap for a prototype problem, the estimation of the response's mean. We propose a double robust SS (DRSS) mean estimator and give a complete characterization of its asymptotic properties. The proposed estimator is consistent as long as either the outcome or the PS model is correctly specified. When both models are correctly specified, we provide inference results with a non-standard consistency rate that depends on the smaller size |L|. The results are also extended to causal inference with imbalanced treatment groups. Further, we provide several novel choices of models and estimators of the decaying PS, including a novel offset logistic model and a stratified labeling model. We present their properties under both high and low dimensional settings. These may be of independent interest. Lastly, we present extensive simulations and also a real data application.</p></details> | <details><summary>88 pa...</summary><p>88 pages; Revised version; Accepted by Information and Inference: A Journal of the IMA</p></details> |

We focus on causal structures containing just two observed variables, each of which is binary. We consider the consequences of imposing different restrictions on the number and cardinality of latent variables and of assuming different functional dependences of the observed variables on the latent ones (in particular, the noise need not be additive). We provide an inductive scheme for classifying functional causal structures into distinct observational equivalence classes. For each observational equivalence class, we provide a procedure for deriving constraints on the joint distribution that are necessary and sufficient conditions for it to arise from a model in that class. We also demonstrate how this sort of approach provides a means of determining which causal parameters are identifiable and how to solve for these. Prospects for expanding the scope of our scheme, in particular to the problem of quantum causal inference, are also discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Journal of Causal Inference.

From the wider view of `probabilistic numerics', CaI offers principled, numerically robust optimal control solvers that provide uncertainty quantification, and can scale to nonlinear problems with approximate inference. We show that AI may be framed as partially-observed CaI when the cost function is defined specifically in the observation states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Workshop on Active Inference 2020 (IWAI)</p></details> |

We provide experiments for variational autoencoders to show advantage of the objective over the evidence lower bound on synthetic datasets obtained by adding uninformative noise objects to MNIST and OMNIGLOT.

Existing offloading techniques, which involve swapping activated and idle experts between the GPU and CPU, often suffer from rigid expert caching mechanisms. These mechanisms fail to adapt to dynamic routing, leading to inefficient cache utilization, or incur prohibitive costs for prediction training. To tackle these inference-specific challenges, we introduce ExpertFlow, a comprehensive system specifically designed to enhance inference efficiency by accommodating flexible routing and enabling efficient expert scheduling between CPU and GPU. This reduces overhead and boosts system performance. Central to our approach is a predictive routing path-based offloading mechanism that utilizes a lightweight predictor to accurately forecast routing paths before computation begins. This proactive strategy allows for real-time error correction in expert caching, significantly increasing cache hit ratios and reducing the frequency of expert transfers, thereby minimizing I/O overhead. Additionally, we implement a dynamic token scheduling strategy that optimizes MoE inference by rearranging input tokens across different batches. This method not only reduces the number of activated experts per batch but also improves computational efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpertFlow achieves up to 93.72\% GPU memory savings and enhances inference speed by 2 to 10 times compared to baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and utility as a robust solution for resource-constrained inference scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mixtu...</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts, Inference, Offloading</p></details> |

We present a new ABC method which uses probabilistic neural emulator networks to learn synthetic likelihoods on simulated data -- both local emulators which approximate the likelihood for specific observed data, as well as global ones which are applicable to a range of data. Simulations are chosen adaptively using an acquisition function which takes into account uncertainty about either the posterior distribution of interest, or the parameters of the emulator. Our approach does not rely on user-defined rejection thresholds or distance functions.

Advances in next-generation sequencing enable detailed yet destructive gene expression assays at the single-cell level, resulting in the loss of cell evolutionary trajectories. Due to technological and cost constraints, single-cell experiments often feature cells sampled at irregular and sparse time points with a small sample size. Although trajectory-based structural inference models can accurately reveal the underlying interaction graph from observed data, their efficacy depends on the inputs of thousands of regularly sampled trajectories. The irregularly-sampled nature of single-cell data precludes the direct use of these powerful models for reconstructing GRNs. Optimal transport, a classical mathematical framework that minimize transportation costs between distributions, has shown promise in multi-omics data integration and cell fate prediction. Utilizing OT, our method constructs mappings between consecutively sampled cells to form cell-level trajectories, which are given as input to a structural inference model that recovers the GRN from single-cell data. Through case studies in two synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed method and its promising performance over eight state-of-the-art GRN inference methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>for t...</summary><p>for the associated code repository, see https://github.com/1250326/Integrating-OT-and-Structural-Inference-Models-for-GRN-Inference-from-Single-cell-Data</p></details> |

With these features, the challenge of kind inference for datatype declarations has presented itself and become a worthy research problem on its own. This paper studies kind inference for datatypes. Inspired by previous research on type-inference, we offer declarative specifications for what datatype declarations should be accepted, both for Haskell98 and for a more advanced system we call PolyKinds, based on the extensions in modern Haskell, including a limited form of dependent types. We believe these formulations to be novel and without precedent, even for Haskell98. These specifications are complemented with implementable algorithmic versions. We study soundness, completeness and the existence of principal kinds in these systems, proving the properties where they hold.

However, in real-world applications, users are often presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity (binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~group-inference, GitHub: https://github.com/GaParmar/group-inference</p></details> |

In this paper we explore the correspondence between generative models that exist at two distinct scales, using spin glass models as a sandbox system to investigate this question. We show that the collective dynamics of a specific type of active inference agent is equivalent to sampling from the stationary distribution of a spin glass system. A collective of specifically-designed active inference agents can thus be described as implementing a form of sampling-based inference (namely, from a Boltzmann machine) at the higher level. However, this equivalence is very fragile, breaking upon simple modifications to the generative models of the individual agents or the nature of their interactions. We discuss the implications of this correspondence and its fragility for the study of multiscale systems composed of Bayesian agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication: 3rd International Workshop on Active Inference</p></details> |

While preliminary investigations worked on simplified versions of BBVI (e.g., bounded domain, bounded support, only optimizing for the scale, and such), our setup does not need any such algorithmic modifications. Our results hold for log-smooth posterior densities with and without strong log-concavity and the location-scale variational family. Also, our analysis reveals that certain algorithm design choices commonly employed in practice, particularly, nonlinear parameterizations of the scale of the variational approximation, can result in suboptimal convergence rates. Fortunately, running BBVI with proximal stochastic gradient descent fixes these limitations, and thus achieves the strongest known convergence rate guarantees. We evaluate this theoretical insight by comparing proximal SGD against other standard implementations of BBVI on large-scale Bayesian inference problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS'23; previous title: "Black-Box Variational Inference Converges"</p></details> |
| **[Causal Inference Using Tractable Circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02891v1)** | 2022-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of this paper is to discuss a recent result which shows that probabilistic inference in the presence of (unknown) causal mechanisms can be tractable for models that have traditionally been viewed as intractable. This result was reported recently to facilitate model-based supervised learning but it can be interpreted in a causality context as follows. One can compile a non-parametric causal graph into an arithmetic circuit that supports inference in time linear in the circuit size. The circuit is also non-parametric so it can be used to estimate parameters from data and to further reason (in linear time) about the causal graph parametrized by these estimates. Moreover, the circuit size can sometimes be bounded even when the treewidth of the causal graph is not, leading to tractable inference on models that have been deemed intractable previously. This has been enabled by a new technique that can exploit causal mechanisms computationally but without needing to know their identities (the classical setup in causal inference). Our goal is to provide a causality-oriented exposure to these new results and to speculate on how they may potentially contribute to more scalable and versatile causal inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in Why-21 workshop of NeurIPS 2021 (Causal Inference & Machine Learning: Why now?)</p></details> |

There are many studies corroborating these trends, but does this translate into an exponential increase in energy consumption? In order to answer this question we focus on inference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of the computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we study relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated. The only caveat is, yet again, the multiplicative factor, as future AI increases penetration and becomes more pervasive.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For a revised version and its published version refer to: Desislavov, Radosvet, Fernando Martínez-Plumed, and José Hernández-Orallo.

| **[Towards Enabling Cardiac Digital Twins of Myocardial Infarction Using Deep Computational Models for Inverse Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04421v3)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) have the potential to offer individualized evaluation of cardiac function in a non-invasive manner, making them a promising approach for personalized diagnosis and treatment planning of my-ocardial infarction (MI). The inference of accurate myocardial tissue properties is crucial in creating a reliable CDT of MI. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of inferring myocardial tissue properties from the electrocardiogram (ECG) within a CDT platform. The platform integrates multi-modal data, such as cardiac MRI and ECG, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the inferred tissue properties. We perform a sensitivity analysis based on computer simulations, systematically exploring the effects of infarct location, size, degree of transmurality, and electrical ac-tivity alteration on the simulated QRS complex of ECG, to establish the limits of the approach. We subsequently present a novel deep computational model, comprising a dual-branch variational autoencoder and an inference model, to infer infarct location and distribution from the simulated QRS. The proposed model achieves mean Dice scores of 0.457 \pm 0.317 and 0.302 \pm 0.273 for the inference of left ventricle scars and border zone, respectively. The sensitivity analysis enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between infarct characteristics and electrophysiological features. The in silico experimental results show that the model can effectively capture the relationship for the inverse inference, with promising potential for clinical application in the future. The code will be released publicly once the manuscript is accepted for publication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Cardi...</summary><p>Cardiac digital twins; Inverse inference; Myocardial infarction</p></details> |

Modern LLM serving extends beyond traditional prefill-decode workflows, incorporating multi-stage processes such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), key-value (KV) cache retrieval, dynamic model routing, and multi step reasoning. These stages exhibit diverse computational demands, requiring distributed systems that integrate GPUs, ASICs, CPUs, and memory-centric architectures. However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions. To address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Infer...</summary><p>Inference System Design for Multi-Stage AI Inference Pipelines. 13 Pages, 15 Figues, 3 Tables</p></details> |

In its current state, OpportunityFinder only requires users to provide raw observational data and a configuration file. A pipeline is then triggered that inspects/processes data, chooses the suitable algorithm(s) to execute the causal study. It returns the causal impact of the treatment on the configured outcome, together with sensitivity and robustness results. Causal inference is widely studied and used to estimate the downstream impact of individual's interactions with products and features. It is common that these causal studies are performed by scientists and/or economists periodically. Business stakeholders are often bottle-necked on scientist or economist bandwidth to conduct causal studies. We offer OpportunityFinder as a solution for commonly performed causal studies with four key features: (1) easy to use for both Business Analysts and Scientists, (2) abstraction of multiple algorithms under a single I/O interface, (3) support for causal impact analysis under binary treatment with panel data and (4) dynamic selection of algorithm based on scale of data.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2023 Workshop - Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice</p></details> |

Although significant progress has been made in each of these areas independently, the best way to integrate them is an open research question. In this paper, we propose the integration of a statistical model of cognitive map formation within an active inference agent that supports planning under uncertainty. Specifically, we examine the clone-structured cognitive graph (CSCG) model of cognitive map formation and compare a naive clone graph agent with an active inference-driven clone graph agent, in three spatial navigation scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that while both agents are effective in simple scenarios, the active inference agent is more effective when planning in challenging scenarios, in which sensory observations provide ambiguous information about location.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IWAI 2023 (International Workshop on Active Inference)</p></details> |

| **[Saffron-1: Safety Inference Scaling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06444v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety.

However, perhaps because of inadequate tools for matrix exponentiation in programming languages commonly used amongst statisticians or a belief that the necessary calculations are prohibitively expensive, statistical inference for continuous-time Markov chains with a large but finite state space is typically conducted via particle MCMC or other relatively complex inference schemes. When, as in many applications $\mathsf{Q}$ arises from a reaction network, it is usually sparse. We describe variations on known algorithms which allow fast, robust and accurate evaluation of the product of a non-negative vector with the exponential of a large, sparse rate matrix. Our implementation uses relatively recently developed, efficient, linear algebra tools that take advantage of such sparsity. We demonstrate the straightforward statistical application of the key algorithm on a model for the mixing of two alleles in a population and on the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed epidemic model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Focus...</summary><p>Focus much more on statistical inference, filtering and prediction</p></details> |

One of the fundamental research issues in Edge-AI is edge inference acceleration, which aims to realize low-latency high-accuracy DNN inference services by leveraging the fine-grained offloading of partitioned inference tasks from end devices to edge servers. However, existing research has yet to adopt a practical Edge-AI market perspective, which would systematically explore the personalized inference needs of AI users (e.g., inference accuracy, latency, and task complexity), the revenue incentives for AI service providers that offer edge inference services, and multi-stakeholder governance within a market-oriented context. To bridge this gap, we propose an Auction-based Edge Inference Pricing Mechanism (AERIA) for revenue maximization to tackle the multi-dimensional optimization problem of DNN model partition, edge inference pricing, and resource allocation. We investigate the multi-exit device-edge synergistic inference scheme for on-demand DNN inference acceleration, and analyse the auction dynamics amongst the AI service providers, AI users and edge infrastructure provider. Owing to the strategic mechanism design via randomized consensus estimate and cost sharing techniques, the Edge-AI market attains several desirable properties, including competitiveness in revenue maximization, incentive compatibility, and envy-freeness, which are crucial to maintain the effectiveness, truthfulness, and fairness of our auction outcomes. The extensive simulation experiments based on four representative DNN inference workloads demonstrate that our AERIA mechanism significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in revenue maximization, demonstrating the efficacy of AERIA for on-demand DNN inference in the Edge-AI market.</p></details> | <details><summary>Index...</summary><p>Index Terms: Edge-AI, DNN Inference Offloading, Resource Management, Dynamic Pricing, Auction Mechanism</p></details> |

| **[Approximate Inference for Fully Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.13440v2)** | 2020-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning in Gaussian Process models occurs through the adaptation of hyperparameters of the mean and the covariance function. The classical approach entails maximizing the marginal likelihood yielding fixed point estimates (an approach called \textit{Type II maximum likelihood} or ML-II). An alternative learning procedure is to infer the posterior over hyperparameters in a hierarchical specification of GPs we call \textit{Fully Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression} (GPR). This work considers two approximation schemes for the intractable hyperparameter posterior: 1) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) yielding a sampling-based approximation and 2) Variational Inference (VI) where the posterior over hyperparameters is approximated by a factorized Gaussian (mean-field) or a full-rank Gaussian accounting for correlations between hyperparameters.

Each player can communicate $\ell$ bits to a central referee in a simultaneous message passing model of communication to help the referee infer a property of the unknown $\bf p$. What is the least number of players for inference required in the communication-starved setting of $\ell<\log k$? We begin by exploring a general "simulate-and-infer" strategy for such inference problems where the center simulates the desired number of samples from the unknown distribution and applies standard inference algorithms for the collocated setting. Our first result shows that for $\ell<\log k$ perfect simulation of even a single sample is not possible. Nonetheless, we present a Las Vegas algorithm that simulates a single sample from the unknown distribution using $O(k/2^\ell)$ samples in expectation. As an immediate corollary, we get that simulate-and-infer attains the optimal sample complexity of $Θ(k^2/2^\ellε^2)$ for learning the unknown distribution to total variation distance $ε$. For the prototypical testing problem of identity testing, simulate-and-infer works with $O(k^{3/2}/2^\ellε^2)$ samples, a requirement that seems to be inherent for all communication protocols not using any additional resources. Interestingly, we can break this barrier using public coins. Specifically, we exhibit a public-coin communication protocol that performs identity testing using $O(k/\sqrt{2^\ell}ε^2)$ samples. Furthermore, we show that this is optimal up to constant factors. Our theoretically sample-optimal protocol is easy to implement in practice. Our proof of lower bound entails showing a contraction in $χ^2$ distance of product distributions due to communication constraints and may be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is superseded by the more recent "Inference under Information Constraints II: Communication Constraints and Shared Randomness" (arXiv:1905.08302), by the same authors</p></details> |

In engineering, the physics behind sensors is often known reasonably accurately and measurement functions can be incorporated into generative models. When a measurement function is non-linear, the transformed variable is typically approximated with a Gaussian distribution to ensure tractable inference. We show that Gaussian approximations that are sensitive to the curvature of the measurement function, such as a second-order Taylor approximation, produce a state-dependent ambiguity term. This induces a preference over states, based on how accurately the state can be inferred from the observation. We demonstrate this preference with a robot navigation experiment where agents plan trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures.

In settings where several GPs are part of the generative model, theses GPs are a posteriori coupled. For many applications such as regression where predictive accuracy is the quantity of interest, this coupling is not crucial. Howewer if one is interested in posterior uncertainty, it cannot be ignored. A key element of variational inference schemes is the choice of the approximate posterior parameterization. When the number of latent variables is large, mean field (MF) methods provide fast and accurate posterior means while more structured posterior lead to inference algorithm of greater computational complexity.

However, a major obstacle to the widespread use of variational methods is the lack of post-hoc accuracy measures that are both theoretically justified and computationally efficient. In this paper, we provide rigorous bounds on the error of posterior mean and uncertainty estimates that arise from full-distribution approximations, as in variational inference. Our bounds are widely applicable, as they require only that the approximating and exact posteriors have polynomial moments. Our bounds are also computationally efficient for variational inference because they require only standard values from variational objectives, straightforward analytic calculations, and simple Monte Carlo estimates. We show that our analysis naturally leads to a new and improved workflow for validated variational inference.

| **[Adversarial Transformer Language Models for Contextual Commonsense Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05406v1)** | 2023-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextualized or discourse aware commonsense inference is the task of generating coherent commonsense assertions (i.e., facts) from a given story, and a particular sentence from that story. Some problems with the task are: lack of controllability for topics of the inferred facts; lack of commonsense knowledge during training; and, possibly, hallucinated or false facts. In this work, we utilize a transformer model for this task and develop techniques to address the aforementioned problems in the task. We control the inference by introducing a new technique we call "hinting". Hinting is a kind of language model prompting, that utilizes both hard prompts (specific words) and soft prompts (virtual learnable templates). This serves as a control signal to advise the language model "what to talk about". Next, we establish a methodology for performing joint inference with multiple commonsense knowledge bases. Joint inference of commonsense requires care, because it is imprecise and the level of generality is more flexible. You want to be sure that the results "still make sense" for the context. To this end, we align the textual version of assertions from three knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC2020, and GLUCOSE) with a story and a target sentence. This combination allows us to train a single model to perform joint inference with multiple knowledge graphs. We show experimental results for the three knowledge graphs on joint inference. Our final contribution is exploring a GAN architecture that generates the contextualized commonsense assertions and scores them as to their plausibility through a discriminator. The result is an integrated system for contextual commonsense inference in stories, that can controllably generate plausible commonsense assertions, and takes advantage of joint inference between multiple commonsense knowledge bases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Semantic Web Journal special edition. https://semantic-web-journal.org/content/adversarial-transformer-language-models-contextual-commonsense-inference-1</p></details> |

However, current models are limited to fully observable domains. In this paper, we describe a deep active inference model that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs. The deep learning architecture optimizes a variant of the expected free energy and encodes the continuous state representation by means of a variational autoencoder.

A model that has these characteristics is the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model. The benefits and negative of the GP-LVM are complementary to the Variational Autoencoder, the former provides interpretable low-dimensional latent representations while the latter is able to handle large amounts of data and can use non-Gaussian likelihoods. Our inspiration for this paper is to marry these two approaches and reap the benefits of both. In order to do so we will introduce a novel approximate inference scheme inspired by the GP-LVM and the VAE. We show experimentally that the approximation allows the capacity of the generative bottle-neck (Z) of the VAE to be arbitrarily large without losing a highly interpretable representation, allowing reconstruction quality to be unlimited by Z at the same time as a low-dimensional space can be used to perform ancestral sampling from as well as a means to reason about the embedded data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NIPS 2017 Workshop on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference</p></details> |

Therefore, third-party inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ICML 2025 Main Proceedings as "Hidden No More: Attacking and Defending Private Third-Party LLM Inference", together with arXiv:2505.18332</p></details> |
| **[Learning in Hybrid Active Inference Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01066v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An open problem in artificial intelligence is how systems can flexibly learn discrete abstractions that are useful for solving inherently continuous problems. Previous work in computational neuroscience has considered this functional integration of discrete and continuous variables during decision-making under the formalism of active inference (Parr, Friston & de Vries, 2017; Parr & Friston, 2018). However, their focus is on the expressive physical implementation of categorical decisions and the hierarchical mixed generative model is assumed to be known. As a consequence, it is unclear how this framework might be extended to learning. We therefore present a novel hierarchical hybrid active inference agent in which a high-level discrete active inference planner sits above a low-level continuous active inference controller. We make use of recent work in recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) which implement end-to-end learning of meaningful discrete representations via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex continuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). The representations learned by the rSLDS inform the structure of the hybrid decision-making agent and allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted sub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the exploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic exploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level problems in the discrete planner. We apply our model to the sparse Continuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via enhanced exploration and successful planning through the delineation of abstract sub-goals.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (+ appendix).

These nuisance functions are generally weakly identified, in that the conditional moment restrictions can be severely ill-posed as well as admit multiple solutions. This is sometimes resolved by imposing strong conditions that imply the function can be estimated at rates that make inference on the functional possible. In this paper, we study a novel condition for the functional to be strongly identified even when the nuisance function is not; that is, the functional is amenable to asymptotically-normal estimation at $\sqrt{n}$-rates. The condition implies the existence of debiasing nuisance functions, and we propose penalized minimax estimators for both the primary and debiasing nuisance functions. The proposed nuisance estimators can accommodate flexible function classes, and importantly they can converge to fixed limits determined by the penalization regardless of the identifiability of the nuisances. We use the penalized nuisance estimators to form a debiased estimator for the functional of interest and prove its asymptotic normality under generic high-level conditions, which provide for asymptotically valid confidence intervals. We also illustrate our method in a novel partially linear proximal causal inference problem and a partially linear instrumental variable regression problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This supersedes the previous version titled "Debiased Inference on Identified Linear Functionals of Underidentified Nuisances via Penalized Minimax Estimation"</p></details> |
| **[Valid causal inference with unobserved confounding in high-dimensional settings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06564v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various methods have recently been proposed to estimate causal effects with confidence intervals that are uniformly valid over a set of data generating processes when high-dimensional nuisance models are estimated by post-model-selection or machine learning estimators. These methods typically require that all the confounders are observed to ensure identification of the effects. We contribute by showing how valid semiparametric inference can be obtained in the presence of unobserved confounders and high-dimensional nuisance models. We propose uncertainty intervals which allow for unobserved confounding, and show that the resulting inference is valid when the amount of unobserved confounding is small relative to the sample size; the latter is formalized in terms of convergence rates. Simulation experiments illustrate the finite sample properties of the proposed intervals and investigate an alternative procedure that improves the empirical coverage of the intervals when the amount of unobserved confounding is large. Finally, a case study on the effect of smoking during pregnancy on birth weight is used to illustrate the use of the methods introduced to perform a sensitivity analysis to unobserved confounding.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |

We derive a learning algorithm for the object models, based on variational expectation maximization (Jordan et al., 1999). We also study an alternative inference algorithm based on the RANSAC method of Fischler and Bolles (1981). We apply these inference methods to (i) data generated from multiple geometric objects like squares and triangles ("constellations"), and (ii) data from a parts-based model of faces.

Although the absence of weight tuning prevents leakage via model parameters, it introduces the risk of inference adversaries exploiting retrieved documents in the model's context. Existing methods for membership inference and data extraction often rely on jailbreaking or carefully crafted unnatural queries, which can be easily detected or thwarted with query rewriting techniques common in RAG systems. In this work, we present Interrogation Attack (IA), a membership inference technique targeting documents in the RAG datastore. By crafting natural-text queries that are answerable only with the target document's presence, our approach demonstrates successful inference with just 30 queries while remaining stealthy; straightforward detectors identify adversarial prompts from existing methods up to ~76x more frequently than those generated by our attack. We observe a 2x improvement in TPR@1%FPR over prior inference attacks across diverse RAG configurations, all while costing less than $0.02 per document inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the full version (27 pages) of the paper 'Riddle Me This!

Here, we study the performance of a deep active inference (dAIF) agent on OpenAI's car racing benchmark, where there is no access to the car's state. The agent learns to encode the world's state from high-dimensional input through unsupervised representation learning. State inference and control are learned end-to-end by optimizing the expected free energy. Results show that our model achieves comparable performance to deep Q-learning. However, vanilla dAIF does not reach state-of-the-art performance compared to other world model approaches. Hence, we discuss the current model implementation's limitations and potential architectures to overcome them.</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd I...</summary><p>2nd International Workshop on Active Inference IWAI2021, European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML/PCKDD 2021)</p></details> |

In the majority of existing schemes, a binary decision of whether a sensor is healthy (functional) or faulty is made based on measured data. The decision boundary is called a threshold and it is usually deterministic. Following a faulty decision, fault recovery is obtained by excluding the malfunctioning sensor. We propose a stochastic fault-tolerant scheme based on active inference and precision learning which does not require a priori threshold definitions to trigger fault recovery. Instead, the sensor precision, which represents its health status, is learned online in a model-free way allowing the system to gradually, and not abruptly exclude a failing unit. Experiments on a robotic manipulator show promising results and directions for future work are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the International Workshop on Active Inference (IWAI) 2021; 11 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

One of the most prominent solutions for secure oblivious inference is based on a powerful cryptographic tools, like Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and/or multi-party computation (MPC). Even though the implementation of oblivious inference systems schemes has impressively improved the last decade, there are still significant limitations on the ML models that they can practically implement. Especially when both the ML model and the input data's confidentiality must be protected. In this paper, we introduce the notion of partially oblivious inference. We empirically show that for neural network models, like CNNs, some information leakage can be acceptable. We therefore propose a novel trade-off between security and efficiency. In our research, we investigate the impact on security and inference runtime performance from the CNN model's weights partial leakage. We experimentally demonstrate that in a CIFAR-10 network we can leak up to $80\%$ of the model's weights with practically no security impact, while the necessary HE-mutliplications are performed four times faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>P.

In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models.

The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 6th International Workshop on Active Inference, 15-17 October 2025, Montreal, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Ensemble Kalman Filtering Meets Gaussian Process SSM for Non-Mean-Field and Online Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05910v5)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) represent a versatile class of data-driven nonlinear dynamical system models. However, the presence of numerous latent variables in GPSSM incurs unresolved issues for existing variational inference approaches, particularly under the more realistic non-mean-field (NMF) assumption, including extensive training effort, compromised inference accuracy, and infeasibility for online applications, among others. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by incorporating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a well-established model-based filtering technique, into the NMF variational inference framework to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent states. This novel marriage between EnKF and GPSSM not only eliminates the need for extensive parameterization in learning variational distributions, but also enables an interpretable, closed-form approximation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Moreover, owing to the streamlined parameterization via the EnKF, the new GPSSM model can be easily accommodated in online learning applications. We demonstrate that the resulting EnKF-aided online algorithm embodies a principled objective function by ensuring data-fitting accuracy while incorporating model regularizations to mitigate overfitting. We also provide detailed analysis and fresh insights for the proposed algorithms. Comprehensive evaluation across diverse real and synthetic datasets corroborates the superior learning and inference performance of our EnKF-aided variational inference algorithms compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gauss...</summary><p>Gaussian process, state-space model, ensemble Kalman filter, online learning, variational inference</p></details> |

Prior studies usually focus on the structure-based estimation to infer network sizes, degree distributions, average degrees, and more. Little effort attempted to estimate the specific degree of each vertex from a sampled induced graph, which prevents us from measuring the lethality of nodes in protein networks and influencers in social networks. The current approaches dramatically fail for a tiny sampled induced graph and require a specific sampling method and a large sample size. These approaches neglect information of the vertex state, representing the dynamical behavior of the networked system, such as the biomass of species or expression of a gene, which is useful for degree estimation. We fill this gap by developing a framework to infer individual vertex degrees using both information of the sampled topology and vertex state. We combine the mean-field theory with combinatorial optimization to learn vertex degrees. Experimental results on real networks with a variety of dynamics demonstrate that our framework can produce reliable degree estimates and dramatically improve existing link prediction methods by replacing the sampled degrees with our estimated degrees.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2020, 7 pages, 4 figures, network inference, incomplete network</p></details> |
| **[Positive-Unlabeled Learning for Control Group Construction in Observational Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14528v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In causal inference, whether through randomized controlled trials or observational studies, access to both treated and control units is essential for estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. When treatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be estimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized settings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and approximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common challenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly labeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To address this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for identifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones, using only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach using both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with diverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various scenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow estimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal sowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show that PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from unlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control group, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value. This work has important implications for observational causal inference, especially in fields where randomized experiments are difficult or costly. In domains such as earth, environmental, and agricultural sciences, it enables a plethora of quasi-experiments by leveraging available earth observation and climate data, particularly when treated units are available but control units are lacking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at KDD 2025 Workshop on Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice</p></details> |

Existing methods of performing private third-party inference, such as Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC), often rely on cryptographic methods. However, these methods are thousands of times slower than standard unencrypted inference, and fail to scale to large modern LLMs. Therefore, recent lines of work have explored the replacement of expensive encrypted nonlinear computations in SMPC with statistical obfuscation methods - in particular, revealing permuted hidden states to the third parties, with accompanying strong claims of the difficulty of reversal into the unpermuted states. In this work, we begin by introducing a novel reconstruction technique that can recover original prompts from hidden states with nearly perfect accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. We then show that extensions of our attack are nearly perfectly effective in reversing permuted hidden states of LLMs, demonstrating the insecurity of three recently proposed privacy schemes. We further dissect the shortcomings of prior theoretical `proofs' of permuation security which allow our attack to succeed. Our findings highlight the importance of rigorous security analysis in privacy-preserving LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ICML 2025 Main Proceedings as "Hidden No More: Attacking and Defending Private Third-Party LLM Inference"</p></details> |

We frame the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner, nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for causal interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Health, Inference, and Learning (CHIL 2025)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, as NNs' accuracy increases, it is followed by an expansion in their size, required number of compute operations and energy consumption. Increase in resource consumption results in NNs' reduced adoption rate and real-world deployment impracticality. Therefore, NNs need to be compressed to make them available to a wider audience and at the same time decrease their runtime costs. In this work, we approach this challenge from a causal inference perspective, and we propose a scoring mechanism to facilitate structured pruning of NNs. The approach is based on measuring mutual information under a maximum entropy perturbation, sequentially propagated through the NN. We demonstrate the method's performance on two datasets and various NNs' sizes, and we show that our approach achieves competitive performance under challenging conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITCI'22: The AAAI-22 Workshop on Information-Theoretic Methods for Causal Inference and Discovery</p></details> |

Elements of such an abstract transformation are essentially constraints for equality and subtyping that capture flow information of the program. In particular, we work with access graphs in the definition of abstract transformations to guarantee the termination of the inference algorithm, because they provide a finite representation of field access paths.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at APLAS'22; arXiv version contains appendices on the construction of concatenation and join for abstract transformations and an example of type inference</p></details> |
| **[A fast asynchronous MCMC sampler for sparse Bayesian inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.06446v1)** | 2021-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a very fast approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling framework that is applicable to a large class of sparse Bayesian inference problems, where the computational cost per iteration in several models is of order $O(ns)$, where $n$ is the sample size, and $s$ the underlying sparsity of the model. This cost can be further reduced by data sub-sampling when stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics are employed. The algorithm is an extension of the asynchronous Gibbs sampler of Johnson et al. (2013), but can be viewed from a statistical perspective as a form of Bayesian iterated sure independent screening (Fan et al. (2009)). We show that in high-dimensional linear regression problems, the Markov chain generated by the proposed algorithm admits an invariant distribution that recovers correctly the main signal with high probability under some statistical assumptions. Furthermore we show that its mixing time is at most linear in the number of regressors. We illustrate the algorithm with several models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spars...</summary><p>Sparse Bayesian inference, Asynchronous MCMC sampling, MCMC mixing, Bayesian deep learning</p></details> |
| **[Property Inference Attacks on Convolutional Neural Networks: Influence and Implications of Target Model's Complexity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13061v1)** | 2021-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models' goal is to make correct predictions for specific tasks by learning important properties and patterns from data. By doing so, there is a chance that the model learns properties that are unrelated to its primary task. Property Inference Attacks exploit this and aim to infer from a given model (\ie the target model) properties about the training dataset seemingly unrelated to the model's primary goal. If the training data is sensitive, such an attack could lead to privacy leakage. This paper investigates the influence of the target model's complexity on the accuracy of this type of attack, focusing on convolutional neural network classifiers. We perform attacks on models that are trained on facial images to predict whether someone's mouth is open. Our attacks' goal is to infer whether the training dataset is balanced gender-wise. Our findings reveal that the risk of a privacy breach is present independently of the target model's complexity: for all studied architectures, the attack's accuracy is clearly over the baseline. We discuss the implication of the property inference on personal data in the light of Data Protection Regulations and Guidelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The long version of the paper "Property Inference Attacks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Model Complexity" from SECRYPT'21</p></details> |

The purpose of this paper is to study inductive inference in a very general setting where finding the truth is not necessarily the goal and where the measure of evidential favoring is not necessarily the likelihood. I use an accuracy argument to argue for probabilism and I develop a new kind of argument to argue for two general updating rules, both of which are reasonable in different contexts. One of the updating rules has standard Bayesian updating, Bissiri et al's (2016) general Bayesian updating, Douven's (2016) IBE-based updating, and Vassend's (2019a) quasi-Bayesian updating as special cases. The other updating rule is novel.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a draft version of the paper "Justifying the Norms of Inductive Inference," which has been accepted for publication by the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science.

| **[Approximate Decentralized Bayesian Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.7471v3)** | 2014-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approximate method for performing Bayesian inference in models with conditional independence over a decentralized network of learning agents. The method first employs variational inference on each individual learning agent to generate a local approximate posterior, the agents transmit their local posteriors to other agents in the network, and finally each agent combines its set of received local posteriors. The key insight in this work is that, for many Bayesian models, approximate inference schemes destroy symmetry and dependencies in the model that are crucial to the correct application of Bayes' rule when combining the local posteriors. The proposed method addresses this issue by including an additional optimization step in the combination procedure that accounts for these broken dependencies. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the decentralized method provides advantages in computational performance and predictive test likelihood over previous batch and distributed methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at UAI 2014.

| **[An Active Inference Model of Mouse Point-and-Click Behaviour](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14611v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a computational user model for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent. The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages + Appendix; Accepted to 6th International Workshop on Active Inference (IWAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Gibbs posterior inference on multivariate quantiles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01052v3)** | 2022-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian and other likelihood-based methods require specification of a statistical model and may not be fully satisfactory for inference on quantities, such as quantiles, that are not naturally defined as model parameters. In this paper, we construct a direct and model-free Gibbs posterior distribution for multivariate quantiles. Being model-free means that inferences drawn from the Gibbs posterior are not subject to model misspecification bias, and being direct means that no priors for or marginalization over nuisance parameters are required. We show here that the Gibbs posterior enjoys a root-$n$ convergence rate and a Bernstein--von Mises property, i.e., for large n, the Gibbs posterior distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian. Moreover, we present numerical results showing the validity and efficiency of credible sets derived from a suitably scaled Gibbs posterior.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19385v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/ (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We aim to provide $1-α$ post-hoc confidence bounds on the number of positive and negative (or non-positive) parameters. The guarantee is simultaneous, for all subsets of parameters. Our suggestion is as follows: start by using the data to select the direction of the hypothesis test for each parameter; then, adjust the $p$-values of the one-sided hypotheses for the selection, and use the adjusted $p$-values for simultaneous inference on the selected $n$ one-sided hypotheses. The adjustment is straightforward assuming that the $p$-values of one-sided hypotheses have densities with monotone likelihood ratio, and are mutually independent. We show that the bounds we provide are tighter (often by a great margin) than existing alternatives, and that they can be obtained by at most a polynomial time. We demonstrate the usefulness of our simultaneous post-hoc bounds in the evaluation of treatment effects across studies or subgroups. Specifically, we provide a tight lower bound on the number of studies which are beneficial, as well as on the number of studies which are harmful (or non-beneficial), and in addition conclude on the effect direction of individual studies, while guaranteeing that the probability of at least one wrong inference is at most 0.05.</p></details> | <details><summary>59 pa...</summary><p>59 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Compositional Visual Generation and Inference with Energy Based Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06030v3)** | 2020-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A vital aspect of human intelligence is the ability to compose increasingly complex concepts out of simpler ideas, enabling both rapid learning and adaptation of knowledge. In this paper we show that energy-based models can exhibit this ability by directly combining probability distributions. Samples from the combined distribution correspond to compositions of concepts. For example, given a distribution for smiling faces, and another for male faces, we can combine them to generate smiling male faces. This allows us to generate natural images that simultaneously satisfy conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations of concepts. We evaluate compositional generation abilities of our model on the CelebA dataset of natural faces and synthetic 3D scene images. We also demonstrate other unique advantages of our model, such as the ability to continually learn and incorporate new concepts, or infer compositions of concept properties underlying an image.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2020 Spotlight; Website at https://energy-based-model.github.io/compositional-generation-inference/</p></details> |
| **[Gibbs posterior inference on the minimum clinically important difference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01840v4)** | 2017-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>IIt is known that a statistically significant treatment may not be clinically significant. A quantity that can be used to assess clinical significance is called the minimum clinically important difference (MCID), and inference on the MCID is an important and challenging problem. Modeling for the purpose of inference on the MCID is non-trivial, and concerns about bias from a misspecified parametric model or inefficiency from a nonparametric model motivate an alternative approach to balance robustness and efficiency. In particular, a recently proposed representation of the MCID as the minimizer of a suitable risk function makes it possible to construct a Gibbs posterior distribution for the MCID without specifying a model. We establish the posterior convergence rate and show, numerically, that an appropriately scaled version of this Gibbs posterior yields interval estimates for the MCID which are both valid and efficient even for relatively small sample sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Doubly Robust Causal Inference via Posterior Coupling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04868v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian doubly robust (DR) causal inference faces a fundamental dilemma: joint modeling of outcome and propensity score suffers from the feedback problem where outcome information contaminates propensity score estimation, while two-step analysis sacrifices valid posterior distributions for computational convenience. We resolve this dilemma through posterior coupling via entropic tilting. Our framework constructs independent posteriors for propensity score and outcome models, then couples them using entropic tilting to enforce the DR moment condition. This yields the first fully Bayesian DR estimator with an explicit posterior distribution. Theoretically, we establish three key properties: (i) when the outcome model is correctly specified, the tilted posterior coincides with the original; (ii) under propensity score model correctness, the posterior mean remains consistent despite outcome model misspecification; (iii) convergence rates improve for nonparametric outcome models. Simulations demonstrate superior bias reduction and efficiency compared to existing methods. We illustrate practical advantages of the proposed method through two applications: sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in antihypertensive treatment effects on dementia, and high-dimensional confounder selection combining shrinkage priors with modified moment conditions for right heart catheterization mortality. We provide an R package implementing the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: Bayesian inference, Double robustness, Efficiency improvement, Entropic tilting, Propensity score</p></details> |
| **[DietCNN: Multiplication-free Inference for Quantized CNNs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05274v2)** | 2023-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising demand for networked embedded systems with machine intelligence has been a catalyst for sustained attempts by the research community to implement Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based inferencing on embedded resource-limited devices. Redesigning a CNN by removing costly multiplication operations has already shown promising results in terms of reducing inference energy usage. This paper proposes a new method for replacing multiplications in a CNN by table look-ups. Unlike existing methods that completely modify the CNN operations, the proposed methodology preserves the semantics of the major CNN operations. Conforming to the existing mechanism of the CNN layer operations ensures that the reliability of a standard CNN is preserved. It is shown that the proposed multiplication-free CNN, based on a single activation codebook, can achieve 4.7x, 5.6x, and 3.5x reduction in energy per inference in an FPGA implementation of MNIST-LeNet-5, CIFAR10-VGG-11, and Tiny ImageNet-ResNet-18 respectively. Our results show that the DietCNN approach significantly improves the resource consumption and latency of deep inference for smaller models, often used in embedded systems.

| **[Efficient Conformal Prediction via Cascaded Inference with Expanded Admission](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03114v3)** | 2021-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel approach for conformal prediction (CP), in which we aim to identify a set of promising prediction candidates -- in place of a single prediction. This set is guaranteed to contain a correct answer with high probability, and is well-suited for many open-ended classification tasks. In the standard CP paradigm, the predicted set can often be unusably large and also costly to obtain. This is particularly pervasive in settings where the correct answer is not unique, and the number of total possible answers is high. We first expand the CP correctness criterion to allow for additional, inferred "admissible" answers, which can substantially reduce the size of the predicted set while still providing valid performance guarantees. Second, we amortize costs by conformalizing prediction cascades, in which we aggressively prune implausible labels early on by using progressively stronger classifiers -- again, while still providing valid performance guarantees. We demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach for multiple applications in natural language processing and computational chemistry for drug discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2021.

| **[Nonparametric Bayesian inference of the microcanonical stochastic block model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02703v4)** | 2018-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A principled approach to characterize the hidden structure of networks is to formulate generative models, and then infer their parameters from data. When the desired structure is composed of modules or "communities", a suitable choice for this task is the stochastic block model (SBM), where nodes are divided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group memberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the modular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and their hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the SBM, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e. the generated networks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show how this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important improvements over more traditional inference approaches: 1. Deeper Bayesian hierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and hyperpriors, that not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the inference on large networks, but also reveal structures at multiple scales; 2. A very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks with a large number of nodes and edges, but also with an unlimited number of modules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular hierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model selection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the posterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it. Furthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach and alternative derivations based on the canonical SBM.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

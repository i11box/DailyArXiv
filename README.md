| **[SVAD: From Single Image to 3D Avatar via Synthetic Data Generation with Video Diffusion and Data Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05475v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint. Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025 SyntaGen Workshop, Project Page: https://yc4ny.github.io/SVAD/</p></details> |
| **[3D Scene Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05474v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations, trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets, evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations, and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity, physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D vision, and embodied intelligence.

| **[DiffusionSfM: Predicting Structure and Motion via Ray Origin and Endpoint Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05473v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, combining learned or geometric pairwise reasoning with a subsequent global optimization step. In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

| **[Mogao: An Omni Foundation Model for Interleaved Multi-Modal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05472v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in unified models for image understanding and generation has been impressive, yet most approaches remain limited to single-modal generation conditioned on multiple modalities. In this paper, we present Mogao, a unified framework that advances this paradigm by enabling interleaved multi-modal generation through a causal approach. Mogao integrates a set of key technical improvements in architecture design, including a deep-fusion design, dual vision encoders, interleaved rotary position embeddings, and multi-modal classifier-free guidance, which allow it to harness the strengths of both autoregressive models for text generation and diffusion models for high-quality image synthesis. These practical improvements also make Mogao particularly effective to process interleaved sequences of text and images arbitrarily. To further unlock the potential of unified models, we introduce an efficient training strategy on a large-scale, in-house dataset specifically curated for joint text and image generation. Extensive experiments show that Mogao not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal understanding and text-to-image generation, but also excels in producing high-quality, coherent interleaved outputs. Its emergent capabilities in zero-shot image editing and compositional generation highlight Mogao as a practical omni-modal foundation model, paving the way for future development and scaling the unified multi-modal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mogao...</summary><p>Mogao Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |
| **[Generating Physically Stable and Buildable LEGO Designs from Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05469v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce LegoGPT, the first approach for generating physically stable LEGO brick models from text prompts. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/</p></details> |
| **[ComPO: Preference Alignment via Comparison Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05465v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct alignment methods are increasingly used for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Bring Reason to Vision: Understanding Perception and Reasoning through Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05464v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

This entails the need to detect these narratives accurately. To address this, we introduce the first taxonomy of common misleading narratives that circulated during recent elections in Europe. Based on this taxonomy, we construct and analyse UKElectionNarratives: the first dataset of human-annotated misleading narratives which circulated during the UK General Elections in 2019 and 2024. We also benchmark Pre-trained and Large Language Models (focusing on GPT-4o), studying their effectiveness in detecting election-related misleading narratives. Finally, we discuss potential use cases and make recommendations for future research directions using the proposed codebook and dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was accepted at the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Markup Language Generation for Contextually-Grounded Visual Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05446v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Document Understanding has become essential with the increase of text-rich visual content. This field poses significant challenges due to the need for effective integration of visual perception and textual comprehension, particularly across diverse document types with complex layouts. Moreover, existing fine-tuning datasets for this domain often fall short in providing the detailed contextual information for robust understanding, leading to hallucinations and limited comprehension of spatial relationships among visual elements. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative pipeline that utilizes adaptive generation of markup languages, such as Markdown, JSON, HTML, and TiKZ, to build highly structured document representations and deliver contextually-grounded responses. We introduce two fine-grained structured datasets: DocMark-Pile, comprising approximately 3.8M pretraining data pairs for document parsing, and DocMark-Instruct, featuring 624k fine-tuning data annotations for grounded instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing state-of-theart MLLMs across a range of visual document understanding benchmarks, facilitating advanced reasoning and comprehension capabilities in complex visual scenarios. Our code and models are released at https://github. com/Euphoria16/DocMark.</p></details> | CVPR2025 |
| **[clem:todd: A Framework for the Systematic Benchmarking of LLM-Based Task-Oriented Dialogue System Realisations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05445v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd (chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Artifact Sharing for Information Retrieval Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05434v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sharing artifacts -- such as trained models, pre-built indexes, and the code to use them -- aids in reproducibility efforts by allowing researchers to validate intermediate steps and improves the sustainability of research by allowing multiple groups to build off one another's prior computational work. Although there are de facto consensuses on how to share research code (through a git repository linked to from publications) and trained models (via HuggingFace Hub), there is no consensus for other types of artifacts, such as built indexes. Given the practical utility of using shared indexes, researchers have resorted to self-hosting these resources or performing ad hoc file transfers upon request, ultimately limiting the artifacts' discoverability and reuse. This demonstration introduces a flexible and interoperable way to share artifacts for Information Retrieval research, improving both their accessibility and usability.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 (demo) |
| **[Ultra-FineWeb: Efficient Data Filtering and Verification for High-Quality LLM Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05427v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data quality has become a key factor in enhancing model performance with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Model-driven data filtering has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data. However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The datasets are available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFineWeb</p></details> |
| **[Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational quantum computing offers a flexible computational paradigm with applications in diverse areas. However, a key obstacle to realizing their potential is the Barren Plateau (BP) phenomenon. When a model exhibits a BP, its parameter optimization landscape becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. Importantly, all the moving pieces of an algorithm -- choices of ansatz, initial state, observable, loss function and hardware noise -- can lead to BPs when ill-suited. Due to the significant impact of BPs on trainability, researchers have dedicated considerable effort to develop theoretical and heuristic methods to understand and mitigate their effects. As a result, the study of BPs has become a thriving area of research, influencing and cross-fertilizing other fields such as quantum optimal control, tensor networks, and learning theory. This article provides a comprehensive review of the current understanding of the BP phenomenon.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 10 boxes, updated to published version</p></details> |
| **[TransProQA: an LLM-based literary Translation evaluation metric with Professional Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05423v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) has extended into literary domains. However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations.</p></details> | WIP |
| **[TokLIP: Marry Visual Tokens to CLIP for Multimodal Comprehension and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05422v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, LLMs can generate hallucinations and nonfactual information, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical tasks. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a statistically rigorous framework for marginal (average) coverage guarantees but has limited exploration in medical QA. This paper proposes an enhanced CP framework for medical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks. By associating the non-conformance score with the frequency score of correct options and leveraging self-consistency, the framework addresses internal model opacity and incorporates a risk control strategy with a monotonic loss function. Evaluated on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU datasets using four off-the-shelf LLMs, the proposed method meets specified error rate guarantees while reducing average prediction set size with increased risk level, offering a promising uncertainty evaluation metric for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published by Mathematics</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |

These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis shows the impact of different components.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper in COLING 2025</p></details> |
| **[On-device Anomaly Detection in Conveyor Belt Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10729v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles.

We investigate evaluation strategies and update methods for LLMs as new data becomes available. We introduce a web-scale dataset for time-continual pretraining of LLMs derived from 114 dumps of Common Crawl (CC) - orders of magnitude larger than previous continual language modeling benchmarks. We also design time-stratified evaluations across both general CC data and specific domains (Wikipedia, StackExchange, and code documentation) to assess how well various continual learning methods adapt to new data while retaining past knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that, on general CC data, autoregressive meta-schedules combined with a fixed-ratio replay of older data can achieve comparable held-out loss to re-training from scratch, while requiring significantly less computation (2.6x). However, the optimal balance between incorporating new data and replaying old data differs as replay is crucial to avoid forgetting on generic web data but less so on specific domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/apple/ml-tic-lm</p></details> |
| **[GeomHair: Reconstruction of Hair Strands from Colorless 3D Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05376v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel method that reconstructs hair strands directly from colorless 3D scans by leveraging multi-modal hair orientation extraction. Hair strand reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics that can be used for high-fidelity digital avatar synthesis, animation, and AR/VR applications. However, accurately recovering hair strands from raw scan data remains challenging due to human hair's complex and fine-grained structure. Existing methods typically rely on RGB captures, which can be sensitive to the environment and can be a challenging domain for extracting the orientation of guiding strands, especially in the case of challenging hairstyles. To reconstruct the hair purely from the observed geometry, our method finds sharp surface features directly on the scan and estimates strand orientation through a neural 2D line detector applied to the renderings of scan shading. Additionally, we incorporate a diffusion prior trained on a diverse set of synthetic hair scans, refined with an improved noise schedule, and adapted to the reconstructed contents via a scan-specific text prompt. We demonstrate that this combination of supervision signals enables accurate reconstruction of both simple and intricate hairstyles without relying on color information. To facilitate further research, we introduce Strands400, the largest publicly available dataset of hair strands with detailed surface geometry extracted from real-world data, which contains reconstructed hair strands from the scans of 400 subjects.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Threshold Modulation for Online Test-Time Adaptation of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05375v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs), deployed on neuromorphic chips, provide highly efficient solutions on edge devices in different scenarios. However, their ability to adapt to distribution shifts after deployment has become a crucial challenge. Online test-time adaptation (OTTA) offers a promising solution by enabling models to dynamically adjust to new data distributions without requiring source data or labeled target samples. Nevertheless, existing OTTA methods are largely designed for traditional artificial neural networks and are not well-suited for SNNs. To address this gap, we propose a low-power, neuromorphic chip-friendly online test-time adaptation framework, aiming to enhance model generalization under distribution shifts. The proposed approach is called Threshold Modulation (TM), which dynamically adjusts the firing threshold through neuronal dynamics-inspired normalization, being more compatible with neuromorphic hardware. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in improving the robustness of SNNs against distribution shifts while maintaining low computational cost. The proposed method offers a practical solution for online test-time adaptation of SNNs, providing inspiration for the design of future neuromorphic chips. The demo code is available at github.com/NneurotransmitterR/TM-OTTA-SNN.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCNN 2025. \c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[From Sleep Staging to Spindle Detection: Evaluating End-to-End Automated Sleep Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05371v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation of sleep analysis, including both macrostructural (sleep stages) and microstructural (e.g., sleep spindles) elements, promises to enable large-scale sleep studies and to reduce variance due to inter-rater incongruencies. While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Verification of models of biological and medical systems is a promising application of formal verification. Human neural networks have recently been emulated and studied as a biological system. In this paper, we provide a model of some crucial neuronal circuits, called "archetypes", in the Coq Proof Assistant and prove properties concerning their dynamic behavior. Understanding the behavior of these modules is crucial because they constitute the elementary building blocks of bigger neuronal circuits. We consider seven fundamental archetypes (simple series, series with multiple outputs, parallel composition, positive loop, negative loop, inhibition of a behavior, and contralateral inhibition), and prove an important representative property for six of them. In building up to our model of archetypes, we also provide a general model of "neuronal circuits", and prove a variety of general properties about neurons and circuits. In addition, we have defined our model with a longer term goal of modelling the composition of basic archetypes into larger networks, and structured our libraries with definitions and lemmas useful for proving the properties in this paper as well as those to be proved as future work.</p></details> | 45 pages, 22 figures |

In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |
| **[Multi-objective optimisation via the R2 utilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11774v4)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of multi-objective optimisation is to identify a collection of points which describe the best possible trade-offs between the multiple objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimisation problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarisation functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarised problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimisation techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimisation problem into a single-objective optimisation problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem are the R2 utilities, which are utility functions that are defined as a weighted integral over the scalarised optimisation problems. As part of our work, we show that these utilities are monotone and submodular set functions which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimisation algorithms. We then analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimisation, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIAM ...</summary><p>SIAM Review 2025. 47 pages.

Specifically, for the sequence defined by f(n) = ((1/2)^n + (-1)^n) / n, we prove that the combination [(n-2)f(n-2) + (n-3)f(n-3)] / [n f(n) + (n-1)f(n-1)] is universally equal to 4 for all integers n >= 4. This invariant bridge across four points opens new possibilities for predictive coding, data compression, and error detection. We demonstrate how the relation can be used to reconstruct missing data, verify data integrity, and reduce redundancy in data streams with minimal computational overhead. The simplicity and universality of this invariant make it a promising tool for a wide range of applications in information theory and coding systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, submitted to arXiv</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks.

In this paper, we propose two novel neural network based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers performing channel estimation and equalization tasks and directly predicting log likelihood ratios (LLRs) from the received in phase and quadrature phase (IQ) signals. The first network, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT), employs a state of the art (SOTA) transformer architecture with an attention mechanism. The second network, the Residual Dual Non Local Attention Network (RDNLA), utilizes a parallel residual architecture with a non local attention block. The bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performance of various SOTA neural receiver architectures is compared with our proposed methods across different signal to noise ratio (SNR) levels. The simulation results show that DAT and RDNLA outperform both traditional communication systems and existing neural receiver models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Globecom 2025</p></details> |
| **[Formulating the Restoration of Distribution Networks as a Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03197v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Severe weather events can cause extensive damage to electrical distribution networks, requiring a multi-day restoration effort. Optimizing the dispatch of repair crews minimizes the severe socio-economic consequences of such events. Considering both repair times and travel times, we use graphical manipulations to transform this multiple crew scheduling problem into a type of traveling salesman problem(TSP). Specifically, we demonstrate that the restoration problem bears major resemblance to an instance of a cost constrained reward maximizing mTSP (multiple TSP) on node and edge weighted (doubly weighted) graphs (a variant we dub the CCRM-mTSP-DW), where the objective is to maximize the aggregate reward earned during the upcoming restoration window, provided no crew violates its time budget and electrical continuity constraints are met. Despite the rich history of research on the TSP and its variants, this CCRM-mTSP-DW variant has not been studied before, although its closest cousin happens to be the "Selective TSP" (S-TSP). This reinterpretation of the restoration problem not only opens up the possibility of drawing on existing solution methods developed for the TSP and its variants, it also adds a new chapter in the annals of research on "TSP-like'' problems. In this paper, we propose a "TSP-like'' mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for solving the restoration problem and validate it on the IEEE PES 123-node test feeder network.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the JOURNAL version (10 pages, 9 figures, 1 table) of the paper.

However, achieving accurate vehicular channel prediction is challenging due to significant Doppler effects and rapid channel variations resulting from high-speed vehicle movement and complex propagation environments. In this paper, we propose a novel delay-Doppler (DD) domain channel prediction framework tailored for high-mobility vehicular networks. By transforming the channel representation into the DD domain, we obtain an intuitive, sparse, and stable depiction that closely aligns with the underlying physical propagation processes, effectively reducing the complex vehicular channel to a set of time-series parameters with enhanced predictability. Furthermore, we leverage the large artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict these DD-domain time-series parameters, capitalizing on their advanced ability to model temporal correlations. The zero-shot capability of the pre-trained large AI model facilitates accurate channel predictions without requiring task-specific training, while subsequent fine-tuning on specific vehicular channel data further improves prediction accuracy. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our DD-domain channel prediction framework and the superior accuracy of the large AI model in predicting time-series channel parameters, thereby highlighting the potential of our approach for robust vehicular communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Augmented Deep Contexts for Spatially Embedded Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05309v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most Neural Video Codecs (NVCs) only employ temporal references to generate temporal-only contexts and latent prior. These temporal-only NVCs fail to handle large motions or emerging objects due to limited contexts and misaligned latent prior. To relieve the limitations, we propose a Spatially Embedded Video Codec (SEVC), in which the low-resolution video is compressed for spatial references. Firstly, our SEVC leverages both spatial and temporal references to generate augmented motion vectors and hybrid spatial-temporal contexts. Secondly, to address the misalignment issue in latent prior and enrich the prior information, we introduce a spatial-guided latent prior augmented by multiple temporal latent representations. At last, we design a joint spatial-temporal optimization to learn quality-adaptive bit allocation for spatial references, further boosting rate-distortion performance. Experimental results show that our SEVC effectively alleviates the limitations in handling large motions or emerging objects, and also reduces 11.9% more bitrate than the previous state-of-the-art NVC while providing an additional low-resolution bitstream. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/EsakaK/SEVC.</p></details> | 15 pages,CVPR |

In retinal imaging, foundation models pretrained on either natural or ophthalmic data have shown promise, but the benefits of in-domain pretraining remain uncertain. To investigate this, we benchmark six SSL-pretrained ViTs on seven digital fundus image (DFI) datasets totaling 70,000 expert-annotated images for the task of moderate-to-late age-related macular degeneration (AMD) identification. Our results show that iBOT pretrained on natural images achieves the highest out-of-distribution generalization, with AUROCs of 0.80-0.97, outperforming domain-specific models, which achieved AUROCs of 0.78-0.96 and a baseline ViT-L with no pretraining, which achieved AUROCs of 0.68-0.91. These findings highlight the value of foundation models in improving AMD identification and challenge the assumption that in-domain pretraining is necessary. Furthermore, we release BRAMD, an open-access dataset (n=587) of DFIs with AMD labels from Brazil.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[T-T: Table Transformer for Tagging-based Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05271v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |

Therefore, it becomes essential to actively incorporate more high-quality labeled data, all while adhering to a constrained labeling budget. To enable data-efficient treatment effect estimation, we formalize the problem through rigorous theoretical analysis within the active learning context, where the derived key measures -- \textit{factual} and \textit{counterfactual covering radius} determine the risk upper bound. To reduce the bound, we propose a greedy radius reduction algorithm, which excels under an idealized, balanced data distribution. To generalize to more realistic data distributions, we further propose FCCM, which transforms the optimization objective into the \textit{Factual} and \textit{Counterfactual Coverage Maximization} to ensure effective radius reduction during data acquisition. Furthermore, benchmarking FCCM against other baselines demonstrates its superiority across both fully synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML'25 |

| **[Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03571v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification.

However, recently several works raise the security issues of 3D deep models. Although most of them consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present the backdoor attacks in 3D point cloud with a unified framework that exploits the unique properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the vulnerability of deep models under spatial transformation; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the PointPBA with over 95% success rate across various 3D datasets and models, and the more stealthy PointCBA with around 50% success rate. Our proposed backdoor attack in 3D point cloud is expected to perform as a baseline for improving the robustness of 3D deep models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2021</p></details> |

Yet, unknown or varying symmetries can lead to overconstrained weights and decreased performance. To address this, this paper introduces a probabilistic method to learn the degree of equivariance in SCNNs. We parameterise the degree of equivariance as a likelihood distribution over the transformation group using Fourier coefficients, offering the option to model layer-wise and shared equivariance. These likelihood distributions are regularised to ensure an interpretable degree of equivariance across the network. Advantages include the applicability to many types of equivariant networks through the flexible framework of SCNNs and the ability to learn equivariance with respect to any subgroup of any compact group without requiring additional layers. Our experiments reveal competitive performance on datasets with mixed symmetries, with learnt likelihood distributions that are representative of the underlying degree of equivariance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, published at ICML 2024 as main conference paper</p></details> |

Our method employs a Schroedinger bridge to transform the noisy speech distribution into the clean speech distribution. To stabilize and improve training, we employ time-dependent scalings of the inputs and outputs of the network, known as preconditioning. We consider two skip connection configurations, which either include or omit the current process state in the denoiser's output, enabling the network to predict either environmental noise or clean speech. Each approach leads to improved performance on different speech enhancement metrics. To maintain stable magnitude levels and balance during training, we use a magnitude-preserving network architecture that normalizes all activations and network weights to unit length. Additionally, we propose learning the contribution of the noisy input within each network block for effective input conditioning. After training, we apply a method to approximate different exponential moving average (EMA) profiles and investigate their effects on the speech enhancement performance. In contrast to image generation tasks, where longer EMA lengths often enhance mode coverage, we observe that shorter EMA lengths consistently lead to better performance on standard speech enhancement metrics. Code, audio examples, and checkpoints are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to WASPAA 2025</p></details> |

To facilitate their efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, model quantization has emerged as a pivotal technique for both compression and acceleration. This survey offers a thorough review of the latest advancements in diffusion model quantization, encapsulating and analyzing the current state of the art in this rapidly advancing domain. First, we provide an overview of the key challenges encountered in the quantization of diffusion models, including those based on U-Net architectures and Diffusion Transformers (DiT). We then present a comprehensive taxonomy of prevalent quantization techniques, engaging in an in-depth discussion of their underlying principles. Subsequently, we perform a meticulous analysis of representative diffusion model quantization schemes from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. From a quantitative standpoint, we rigorously benchmark a variety of methods using widely recognized datasets, delivering an extensive evaluation of the most recent and impactful research in the field. From a qualitative standpoint, we categorize and synthesize the effects of quantization errors, elucidating these impacts through both visual analysis and trajectory examination.

Methods: Inspired by the EndoViT study, we adapt the Masked Autoencoder for federated learning, enhancing it with adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM) and Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA). Our model is pretrained on the Endo700k dataset collection and later fine-tuned and evaluated for tasks such as Semantic Segmentation, Action Triplet Recognition, and Surgical Phase Recognition. Results: Our findings demonstrate that integrating adaptive FedSAM into the federated MAE approach improves pretraining, leading to a reduction in reconstruction loss per patch. The application of FL-EndoViT in surgical downstream tasks results in performance comparable to CEN-EndoViT. Furthermore, FL-EndoViT exhibits advantages over CEN-EndoViT in surgical scene segmentation when data is limited and in action triplet recognition when large datasets are used. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential of federated learning for privacy-preserving training of surgical foundation models, offering a robust and generalizable solution for surgical data science. Effective collaboration requires adapting federated learning methods, such as the integration of FedSAM, which can accommodate the inherent data heterogeneity across institutions. In future, exploring FL in video-based models may enhance these capabilities by incorporating spatiotemporal dynamics crucial for real-world surgical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to IEEE TMI</p></details> |
| **[Stochastic Variational Propagation: Local, Scalable and Efficient Alternative to Backpropagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05181v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backpropagation (BP) is the cornerstone of deep learning, but its reliance on global gradient synchronization limits scalability and imposes significant memory overhead. We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Understanding In-context Learning of Addition via Activation Subspaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05145v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.</p></details> | 16 pages |

To defend against these threats, it is essential to have anomaly detection systems that can identify a variety of malicious behaviors. However, a significant challenge in this area is the limited availability of training data. Existing datasets often do not provide sufficient coverage of the diverse API structures, parameter formats, and usage patterns encountered in real-world scenarios. As a result, models trained on these datasets often struggle to generalize and may fail to detect less common or emerging attack vectors. To enhance detection accuracy and robustness, it is crucial to access larger and more representative datasets that capture the true variability of API traffic. To address this, we introduce a GAN-inspired learning framework that extends limited API traffic datasets through targeted, domain-aware synthesis. Drawing on techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), our approach leverages Transformer-based architectures, particularly RoBERTa, to enhance the contextual representation of API requests and generate realistic synthetic samples aligned with security-specific semantics. We evaluate our framework on two benchmark datasets, CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023, and compare it with a previous data augmentation technique to assess the importance of domain-specific synthesis. In addition, we apply our augmented data to various anomaly detection models to evaluate its impact on classification performance. Our method achieves up to a 4.94% increase in F1 score on CSIC 2010 and up to 21.10% on ATRDF 2023.

In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach utilizing a vision transformer (ViT) architecture with DINO-v2 pretrained weights to model indoor radio propagation. Our method processes a floor map with additional features of the walls to generate indoor pathloss maps. We systematically evaluate the effects of architectural choices, data augmentation strategies, and feature engineering techniques. Our findings indicate that extensive augmentation significantly improves generalization, while feature engineering is crucial in low-data regimes.

Existing methods primarily rely on supervised learning approaches that require paired datasets of watermarked and watermark-free images, which are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose SSH-Net, a Self-Supervised and Hybrid Network specifically designed for noisy image watermark removal. SSH-Net synthesizes reference watermark-free images using the watermark distribution in a self-supervised manner and adopts a dual-network design to address the task. The upper network, focused on the simpler task of noise removal, employs a lightweight CNN-based architecture, while the lower network, designed to handle the more complex task of simultaneously removing watermarks and noise, incorporates Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies and capture intricate image features. To enhance the model's effectiveness, a shared CNN-based feature encoder is introduced before dual networks to extract common features that both networks can leverage. Our code will be available at https://github.com/wenyang001/SSH-Net.</p></details> | Under Review in JVCI |

The spectrum of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal, locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |

Most existing methods approach this problem exclusively in the audio domain, typically using online time warping (OLTW) techniques on incoming audio and an audio representation of the score. Audio OLTW techniques have seen incremental improvements both in features and model heuristics which reached a performance plateau in the past ten years. We argue that converting and representing the performance in the symbolic domain -- thereby transforming music tracking into a symbolic task -- can be a more effective approach, even when the domain transformation is imperfect. Our music tracking system combines two real-time components: one handling audio-to-note transcription and the other a novel symbol-level tracker between transcribed input and score. We compare the performance of this mixed audio-symbolic approach with its equivalent audio-only counterpart, and demonstrate that our method outperforms the latter in terms of both precision, i.e., absolute tracking error, and robustness, i.e., tracking success.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 tables, 2 pseudocodes, to be published at the Sound and Music Computing Conference 2025</p></details> |

This fact has led to an increasing adoption of GA in applied mathematics and engineering problems. However, the scarcity of symbolic implementations of GA and its inherent complexity, requiring a specific mathematical background, make it challenging and less intuitive for engineers to work with. This prevents wider adoption among more applied professionals. To address this challenge, this paper introduces SUGAR (Symbolic and User-friendly Geometric Algebra Routines), an open-source toolbox designed for Matlab and licensed under the MIT License. SUGAR facilitates the translation of GA concepts into Matlab and provides a collection of user-friendly functions tailored for GA computations, including support for symbolic operations. It supports both numeric and symbolic computations in high-dimensional GAs. Specifically tailored for applied mathematics and engineering applications, SUGAR has been meticulously engineered to represent geometric elements and transformations within two and three-dimensional projective and conformal geometric algebras, aligning with established computational methodologies in the literature. Furthermore, SUGAR efficiently handles functions of multivectors, such as exponential, logarithmic, sinusoidal, and cosine functions, enhancing its applicability across various engineering domains, including robotics, control systems, and power electronics. Finally, this work includes four distinct validation examples, demonstrating SUGAR's capabilities across the above-mentioned fields and its practical utility in addressing real-world applied mathematics and engineering problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 6 figures, journal paper accepted in ACM TOMS</p></details> |
| **[SeriesBench: A Benchmark for Narrative-Driven Drama Series Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21435v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), an increasing number of benchmarks have been established to evaluate the video understanding capabilities of these models. However, these benchmarks focus on standalone videos and mainly assess "visual elements" like human actions and object states. In reality, contemporary videos often encompass complex and continuous narratives, typically presented as a series. To address this challenge, we propose SeriesBench, a benchmark consisting of 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks that require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a diverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel long-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information transformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task formats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot structures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel narrative reasoning framework, PC-DCoT. Extensive results on SeriesBench indicate that existing MLLMs still face significant challenges in understanding narrative-driven series, while PC-DCoT enables these MLLMs to achieve performance improvements. Overall, our SeriesBench and PC-DCoT highlight the critical necessity of advancing model capabilities to understand narrative-driven series, guiding the future development of MLLMs. SeriesBench is publicly available at https://github.com/zackhxn/SeriesBench-CVPR2025.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 15 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in Text-to-X (e.g., vision and audio data) generation, their use in time series generation remains in its nascent stages. Existing approaches face two critical limitations: (1) the lack of systematic exploration of general-proposed time series captions, which are often domain-specific and struggle with generalization; and (2) the inability to generate time series of arbitrary lengths, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we first categorize time series captions into three levels: point-level, fragment-level, and instance-level. Additionally, we introduce a new fragment-level dataset containing over 600,000 high-resolution time series-text pairs. Second, we propose Text-to-Series (T2S), a diffusion-based framework that bridges the gap between natural language and time series in a domain-agnostic manner. T2S employs a length-adaptive variational autoencoder to encode time series of varying lengths into consistent latent embeddings. On top of that, T2S effectively aligns textual representations with latent embeddings by utilizing Flow Matching and employing Diffusion Transformer as the denoiser. We train T2S in an interleaved paradigm across multiple lengths, allowing it to generate sequences of any desired length. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that T2S achieves state-of-the-art performance across 13 datasets spanning 12 domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2025)</p></details> |

TetWeave constructs tetrahedral grids on-the-fly via Delaunay triangulation, enabling increased flexibility compared to predefined grids. The extracted meshes are guaranteed to be watertight, two-manifold and intersection-free. The flexibility of TetWeave enables a resampling strategy that places new points where reconstruction error is high and allows to encourage mesh fairness without compromising on reconstruction error. This leads to high-quality, adaptive meshes that require minimal memory usage and few parameters to optimize. Consequently, TetWeave exhibits near-linear memory scaling relative to the vertex count of the output mesh - a substantial improvement over predefined grids. We demonstrate the applicability of TetWeave to a broad range of challenging tasks in computer graphics and vision, such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, mesh compression and geometric texture generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Trans.

Recently, diffusion models have emerged as transformative tools for addressing complex challenges within ITS. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of diffusion models for ITS, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. First, we introduce the theoretical foundations of diffusion models and their key variants, including conditional diffusion models and latent diffusion models, highlighting their suitability for modeling complex, multi-modal traffic data and enabling controllable generation. Second, we outline the primary challenges in ITS and the corresponding advantages of diffusion models, providing readers with a deeper understanding of the intersection between ITS and diffusion models. Third, we offer a multi-perspective investigation of current applications of diffusion models in ITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, trajectory prediction, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion model techniques and highlight key ITS research directions that warrant further investigation. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for ITS, thereby advancing their future applications in the transportation domain.</p></details> | 7 figures |
| **[A nonlinear elasticity model in computer vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17237v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze a nonlinear elasticity model introduced by the authors for comparing two images, regarded as bounded open subsets of $\R^n$ together with associated vector-valued intensity maps. Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another. The question is studied as to whether for images related by an affine mapping the unique minimiser is given by that affine mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimisers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of affinely related images.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been substantially revised.

| **[Semantic Shift Estimation via Dual-Projection and Classifier Reconstruction for Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05423v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exemplar-Free Class-Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to sequentially learn from distinct categories without retaining exemplars but easily suffers from catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. While existing EFCIL methods leverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two critical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the embeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks, and the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with new data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, across various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Inspired by the success of the original Videoface digitizer, a pioneering device that allowed users to capture video signals from any source, we have designed an advanced video analytics tool to efficiently create structured video stories, i.e. identity-based information catalogs. VideoFace2.0 is the name of the developed system for spatial and temporal localization of each unique face in the input video, i.e. face re-identification (ReID), which also allows their cataloging, characterization and creation of structured video outputs for later downstream tasks. Developed near real-time solution is primarily designed to be utilized in application scenarios involving TV production, media analysis, and as an efficient tool for creating large video datasets necessary for training machine learning (ML) models in challenging vision tasks such as lip reading and multimodal speech recognition. Conducted experiments confirm applicability of the proposed face ReID algorithm that is combining the concepts of face detection, face recognition and passive tracking-by-detection in order to achieve robust and efficient face ReID. The system is envisioned as a compact and modular extensions of the existing video production equipment. Presented results are based on test implementation that achieves between 18-25 fps on consumer type notebook. Ablation experiments also confirmed that the proposed algorithm brings relative gain in the reduction of number of false identities in the range of 73%-93%.

Even if the input videos are stable, the stitched video can inevitably cause undesired warping shakes and affect the visual experience. To address this issue, we propose StabStitch++, a novel video stitching framework to realize spatial stitching and temporal stabilization with unsupervised learning simultaneously. First, different from existing learning-based image stitching solutions that typically warp one image to align with another, we suppose a virtual midplane between original image planes and project them onto it. Concretely, we design a differentiable bidirectional decomposition module to disentangle the homography transformation and incorporate it into our spatial warp, evenly spreading alignment burdens and projective distortions across two views. Then, inspired by camera paths in video stabilization, we derive the mathematical expression of stitching trajectories in video stitching by elaborately integrating spatial and temporal warps. Finally, a warp smoothing model is presented to produce stable stitched videos with a hybrid loss to simultaneously encourage content alignment, trajectory smoothness, and online collaboration. Compared with StabStitch that sacrifices alignment for stabilization, StabStitch++ makes no compromise and optimizes both of them simultaneously, especially in the online mode. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning framework, we build a video stitching dataset with a rich diversity in camera motions and scenes. Experiments exhibit that StabStitch++ surpasses current solutions in stitching performance, robustness, and efficiency, offering compelling advancements in this field by building a real-time online video stitching system.</p></details> | <details><summary>TPAMI...</summary><p>TPAMI2025; https://github.com/nie-lang/StabStitch2. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2403.06378</p></details> |

Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines.

Even though invariance and/or equivariance to Euclidean transformations are required for many common tasks, KPConv-based networks can only approximately achieve such properties when training on large datasets or with significant data augmentations. Using Frame Averaging, we allow to flexibly customize point cloud neural networks built with KPConv layers, by making them exactly invariant and/or equivariant to translations, rotations and/or reflections of the input point clouds. By simply wrapping around an existing KPConv-based network, FA-KPConv embeds geometrical prior knowledge into it while preserving the number of learnable parameters and not compromising any input information. We showcase the benefit of such an introduced bias for point cloud classification and point cloud registration, especially in challenging cases such as scarce training data or randomly rotated test data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, accepted at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

This position paper argues for the need to transform the traditional one-way review system into a bi-directional feedback loop where authors evaluate review quality and reviewers earn formal accreditation, creating an accountability framework that promotes a sustainable, high-quality peer review system. The current review system can be viewed as an interaction between three parties: the authors, reviewers, and system (i.e., conference), where we posit that all three parties share responsibility for the current problems. However, issues with authors can only be addressed through policy enforcement and detection tools, and ethical concerns can only be corrected through self-reflection. As such, this paper focuses on reforming reviewer accountability with systematic rewards through two key mechanisms: (1) a two-stage bi-directional review system that allows authors to evaluate reviews while minimizing retaliatory behavior, (2)a systematic reviewer reward system that incentivizes quality reviewing. We ask for the community's strong interest in these problems and the reforms that are needed to enhance the peer review process.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML2...</summary><p>ICML2025 Position Track Oral</p></details> |

Despite its growing popularity, FL faces challenges in preserving the privacy of local datasets, its sensitivity to poisoning attacks by malicious users, and its communication overhead. The latter is additionally considerably dominant in large-scale networks. These limitations are often individually mitigated by local differential privacy (LDP) mechanisms, robust aggregation, compression, and user selection techniques, which typically come at the cost of accuracy. In this work, we present compressed private aggregation (CPA), that allows massive deployments to simultaneously communicate at extremely low bit rates while achieving privacy, anonymity, and resilience to malicious users. CPA randomizes a codebook for compressing the data into a few bits using nested lattice quantizers, while ensuring anonymity and robustness, with a subsequent perturbation to hold LDP. The proposed CPA is proven to result in FL convergence in the same asymptotic rate as FL without privacy, compression, and robustness considerations, while satisfying both anonymity and LDP requirements. These analytical properties are empirically confirmed in a numerical study, where we demonstrate the performance gains of CPA compared with separate mechanisms for compression and privacy for training different image classification models, as well as its robustness in mitigating the harmful effects of malicious users.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2208.10888</p></details> |
| **[Learning Item Representations Directly from Multimodal Features for Effective Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04960v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional multimodal recommender systems predominantly leverage Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) optimization to learn item representations by amalgamating item identity (ID) embeddings with multimodal features. Nevertheless, our empirical and theoretical findings unequivocally demonstrate a pronounced optimization gradient bias in favor of acquiring representations from multimodal features over item ID embeddings. As a consequence, item ID embeddings frequently exhibit suboptimal characteristics despite the convergence of multimodal feature parameters. Given the rich informational content inherent in multimodal features, in this paper, we propose a novel model (i.e., LIRDRec) that learns item representations directly from these features to augment recommendation performance. Recognizing that features derived from each modality may capture disparate yet correlated aspects of items, we propose a multimodal transformation mechanism, integrated with modality-specific encoders, to effectively fuse features from all modalities. Moreover, to differentiate the influence of diverse modality types, we devise a progressive weight copying fusion module within LIRDRec. This module incrementally learns the weight assigned to each modality in synthesizing the final user or item representations. Finally, we utilize the powerful visual understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to convert the item images into texts and extract semantics embeddings upon the texts via LLMs. Empirical evaluations conducted on five real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach relative to competing baselines. It is worth noting the proposed model, equipped with embeddings extracted from MLLMs and LLMs, can further improve the recommendation accuracy of NDCG@20 by an average of 4.21% compared to the original embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/enoche/LIRDRec</p></details> |

However, acquiring accurate channel state information (CSI) remains challenging due to the large number of reconfigurable ports and the limited availability of radio-frequency (RF) chains -- particularly in high-dimensional FAS scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient posterior sampling-based channel estimator that leverages a diffusion model (DM) with a simplified U-Net architecture to capture the spatial correlation structure of two-dimensional FAS channels. The DM is initially trained offline in an unsupervised way and then applied online as a learned implicit prior to reconstruct CSI from partial observations via posterior sampling through a denoising diffusion restoration model (DDRM). To accelerate the online inference, we introduce a skipped sampling strategy that updates only a subset of latent variables during the sampling process, thereby reducing the computational cost with minimal accuracy degradation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher estimation accuracy and over 20x speedup compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based methods, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in high-dimensional FAS.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, submitted to an IEEE conference</p></details> |

These models are being deployed as general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present enigme, an open-source library for generating text-based puzzles to be used in training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and future AI architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of The 2025 11th International Conference on Engineering, Applied Sciences, and Technology (ICEAST)</p></details> |

Current studies focus on the Class Activation Map (CAM) of CNN and the self-attention map of transformer to identify the region of objects. However, both CAM and self-attention maps can not learn pixel-level fine-grained information on the foreground objects, which hinders the further advance of WSOL. To address this problem, we initiatively leverage the capability of zero-shot generalization and fine-grained segmentation in Segment Anything Model (SAM) to boost the activation of integral object regions. Further, to alleviate the semantic ambiguity issue accrued in single point prompt-based SAM, we propose an innovative mask prompt to SAM (Pro2SAM) network with grid points for WSOL task. First, we devise a Global Token Transformer (GTFormer) to generate a coarse-grained foreground map as a flexible mask prompt, where the GTFormer jointly embeds patch tokens and novel global tokens to learn foreground semantics. Secondly, we deliver grid points as dense prompts into SAM to maximize the probability of foreground mask, which avoids the lack of objects caused by a single point/box prompt. Finally, we propose a pixel-level similarity metric to come true the mask matching from mask prompt to SAM, where the mask with the highest score is viewed as the final localization map. Experiments show that the proposed Pro2SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC, with 84.03\% and 66.85\% Top-1 Loc, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

The recent algorithms mostly employ expert-agent switching systems to reduce the expert's burden by limitedly selecting the supervision timing. However, the precise selection is difficult and such a switching causes abrupt changes in actions, damaging the dynamic stability. This paper therefore proposes a novel method, so-called CubeDAgger, which improves robustness while reducing dynamic stability violations by making three improvements to a baseline method, EnsembleDAgger. The first improvement adds a regularization to explicitly activate the threshold for deciding the supervision timing. The second transforms the expert-agent switching system to an optimal consensus system of multiple action candidates. Third, autoregressive colored noise to the actions is introduced to make the stochastic exploration consistent over time. These improvements are verified by simulations, showing that the learned policies are sufficiently robust while maintaining dynamic stability during interaction.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

These improvements enhance traffic safety and entertainment services. However, the limited coverage and frequent handovers in 5G networks cause network instability, especially in high-mobility environments due to the ping-pong effect. This paper presents TH-GCN (Throughput-oriented Graph Convolutional Network), a novel approach for optimizing handover management in dense 5G networks. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), TH-GCN models vehicles and base stations as nodes in a dynamic graph enriched with features such as signal quality, throughput, vehicle speed, and base station load. By integrating both user equipment and base station perspectives, this dual-centric approach enables adaptive, real-time handover decisions that improve network stability. Simulation results show that TH-GCN reduces handovers by up to 78 percent and improves signal quality by 10 percent, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE DCOSS-IoT 2025</p></details> |

In contrast, we propose a data-driven multi-view reasoning approach that directly infers 3D scene geometry and camera poses from multi-view images. Our framework, DiffusionSfM, parameterizes scene geometry and cameras as pixel-wise ray origins and endpoints in a global frame and employs a transformer-based denoising diffusion model to predict them from multi-view inputs. To address practical challenges in training diffusion models with missing data and unbounded scene coordinates, we introduce specialized mechanisms that ensure robust learning. We empirically validate DiffusionSfM on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms classical and learning-based approaches while naturally modeling uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from $63\%$ to $95\%$. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from $59\%$ to $92\%$, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, little to no reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of image quality or diversity, and both remained stable in our experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo</p></details> |

To achieve this, we construct a large-scale, physically stable dataset of LEGO designs, along with their associated captions, and train an autoregressive large language model to predict the next brick to add via next-token prediction. To improve the stability of the resulting designs, we employ an efficient validity check and physics-aware rollback during autoregressive inference, which prunes infeasible token predictions using physics laws and assembly constraints. Our experiments show that LegoGPT produces stable, diverse, and aesthetically pleasing LEGO designs that align closely with the input text prompts. We also develop a text-based LEGO texturing method to generate colored and textured designs. We show that our designs can be assembled manually by humans and automatically by robotic arms. We also release our new dataset, StableText2Lego, containing over 47,000 LEGO structures of over 28,000 unique 3D objects accompanied by detailed captions, along with our code and models at the project website: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://avalovelace1.github.io/LegoGPT/</p></details> |

It is shown how the presence of covariates allows to borrow information from far away locations in the observation window, enabling consistent inference in the growing domain asymptotics. In particular, optimal posterior contraction rates under both global and point-wise loss functions are derived. The rates in global loss are obtained under conditions on the prior distribution resembling those in the well established theory of Bayesian nonparametrics, combined with concentration inequalities for functionals of stationary processes to control certain random covariate-dependent loss functions appearing in the analysis. The local rates are derived with an ad-hoc study that builds on recent advances in the theory of P\'olya tree priors, extended to the present multivariate setting with a novel construction that makes use of the random geometry induced by the covariates.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, to appear in Bernoulli</p></details> |

However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

Model-driven data filtering has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data. However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The datasets are available on https://huggingface.co/datasets/openbmb/UltraFineWeb</p></details> |
| **[Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 30 figures.

These methods face two challenges: (1) the retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed independently for each event without considering their possible relationship. In this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet effective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we propose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively leverage possible connections between different events and thus capture relevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE).

While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference.

While individual steps, such as sleep staging and spindle detection, have been studied separately, the feasibility of automating multi-step sleep analysis remains unclear. Here, we evaluate whether a fully automated analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning models for sleep staging (RobustSleepNet) and subsequent spindle detection (SUMOv2) can replicate findings from an expert-based study of bipolar disorder. The automated analysis qualitatively reproduced key findings from the expert-based study, including significant differences in fast spindle densities between bipolar patients and healthy controls, accomplishing in minutes what previously took months to complete manually. While the results of the automated analysis differed quantitatively from the expert-based study, possibly due to biases between expert raters or between raters and the models, the models individually performed at or above inter-rater agreement for both sleep staging and spindle detection. Our results demonstrate that fully automated approaches have the potential to facilitate large-scale sleep research. We are providing public access to the tools used in our automated analysis by sharing our code and introducing SomnoBot, a privacy-preserving sleep analysis platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paper addresses key concerns in this domain, focusing on inferring state representations from individual agent observations and leveraging these representations to enhance agents' exploration and collaborative task execution policies. To this end, we propose a novel state modelling framework for cooperative MARL, where agents infer meaningful belief representations of the non-observable state, with respect to optimizing their own policies, while filtering redundant and less informative joint state information. Building upon this framework, we propose the MARL SMPE algorithm. In SMPE, agents enhance their own policy's discriminative abilities under partial observability, explicitly by incorporating their beliefs into the policy network, and implicitly by adopting an adversarial type of exploration policies which encourages agents to discover novel, high-value states while improving the discriminative abilities of others. Experimentally, we show that SMPE outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms in complex fully cooperative tasks from the MPE, LBF, and RWARE benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Poster) at ICML 2025</p></details> |

| **[Transformer-based assignment decision network for multiple object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03571v3)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data association is a crucial component for any multiple object tracking (MOT) method that follows the tracking-by-detection paradigm. To generate complete trajectories such methods employ a data association process to establish assignments between detections and existing targets during each timestep. Recent data association approaches try to solve either a multi-dimensional linear assignment task or a network flow minimization problem or tackle it via multiple hypotheses tracking. However, during inference an optimization step that computes optimal assignments is required for every sequence frame inducing additional complexity to any given solution. To this end, in the context of this work we introduce Transformer-based Assignment Decision Network (TADN) that tackles data association without the need of any explicit optimization during inference. In particular, TADN can directly infer assignment pairs between detections and active targets in a single forward pass of the network. We have integrated TADN in a rather simple MOT framework, designed a novel training strategy for efficient end-to-end training and demonstrated the high potential of our approach for online visual tracking-by-detection MOT on several popular benchmarks, i.e. MOT17, MOT20 and UA-DETRAC. Our proposed approach demonstrates strong performance in most evaluation metrics despite its simple nature as a tracker lacking significant auxiliary components such as occlusion handling or re-identification.

SocialEgoNet uses whole-body skeletons (keypoints from face, hands and body) extracted from only 1 second of video input for high inference speed. For evaluation, we augment an existing egocentric human-agent interaction dataset with new class labels and bounding box annotations. Extensive experiments on this augmented dataset, named JPL-Social, demonstrate \emph{real-time} inference and superior performance (average accuracy across all tasks: 83.15\%) of our model outperforming several competitive baselines.

Traditional methods often utilize filtering techniques. These techniques can lead to the loss of significant information by prioritizing top K items based on item attributes or employing low-precision attention mechanisms. In this study, we introduce LREA, a novel attention mechanism that overcomes the limitations of existing approaches while ensuring computational efficiency. LREA leverages low-rank matrix decomposition to optimize runtime performance and incorporates a specially designed loss function to maintain attention capabilities while preserving information integrity. During the inference phase, matrix absorption and pre-storage strategies are employed to effectively meet runtime constraints. The results of extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, accepted by SIGIR 2025 Short Paper Track</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Inference on Cooperative Control of Networked Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13701v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancement of understanding the control mechanism of networked dynamical systems (NDSs), which are governed by components such as nodal dynamics and topology. This paper reveals that the critical components in continuous-time state feedback cooperative control of NDSs can be inferred merely from discrete observations. In particular, we advocate a bi-level inference framework to estimate the global closed-loop system and extract the components, respectively. The novelty lies in bridging the gap from discrete observations to the continuous-time model and effectively decoupling the concerned components. Specifically, in the first level, we design a causality-based estimator for the discrete-time closed-loop system matrix, which can achieve asymptotically unbiased performance when the NDS is stable. In the second level, we introduce a matrix logarithm based method to recover the continuous-time counterpart matrix, providing new sampling period guarantees and establishing the recovery error bound. By utilizing graph properties of the NDS, we develop least square based procedures to decouple the concerned components with up to a scalar ambiguity. Furthermore, we employ inverse optimal control techniques to reconstruct the objective function driving the control process, deriving necessary conditions for the solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In lifted inference, a representative of indistinguishable objects is used for computations. To obtain a relational (i.e., lifted) representation, the Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) algorithm is the state of the art. The ACP algorithm, however, requires underlying distributions, encoded as potential-based factorisations, to exactly match to identify and exploit indistinguishabilities. Hence, ACP is unsuitable for practical applications where potentials learned from data inevitably deviate even if associated objects are indistinguishable. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the $\varepsilon$-Advanced Colour Passing ($\varepsilon$-ACP) algorithm, which allows for a deviation of potentials depending on a hyperparameter $\varepsilon$. $\varepsilon$-ACP efficiently uncovers and exploits indistinguishabilities that are not exact. We prove that the approximation error induced by $\varepsilon$-ACP is strictly bounded and our experiments show that the approximation error is close to zero in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper accepted to the Proceedings of the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2025)</p></details> |

This assumption often fails under domain shifts, leading to degraded performance and poor generalization. To address these limitations and improve the robustness of CBMs, we propose the Concept-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CUDA) framework. CUDA is designed to: (1) align concept representations across domains using adversarial training, (2) introduce a relaxation threshold to allow minor domain-specific differences in concept distributions, thereby preventing performance drop due to over-constraints of these distributions, (3) infer concepts directly in the target domain without requiring labeled concept data, enabling CBMs to adapt to diverse domains, and (4) integrate concept learning into conventional domain adaptation (DA) with theoretical guarantees, improving interpretability and establishing new benchmarks for DA. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CBM and DA methods on real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

We propose Stochastic Variational Propagation (SVP), a scalable alternative that reframes training as hierarchical variational inference. SVP treats layer activations as latent variables and optimizes local Evidence Lower Bounds (ELBOs), enabling independent, local updates while preserving global coherence. However, directly applying KL divergence in layer-wise ELBOs risks inter-layer's representation collapse due to excessive compression. To prevent this, SVP projects activations into low-dimensional spaces via fixed random matrices, ensuring information preservation and representational diversity. Combined with a feature alignment loss for inter-layer consistency, SVP achieves competitive accuracy with BP across diverse architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers) and datasets (MNIST to ImageNet), reduces memory usage by up to 4x, and significantly improves scalability. More broadly, SVP introduces a probabilistic perspective to deep representation learning, opening pathways toward more modular and interpretable neural network design.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Particle Gibbs without the Gibbs bit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04611v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exact parameter and trajectory inference in state-space models is typically achieved by one of two methods: particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) or particle Gibbs (PGibbs). PMMH is a pseudo-marginal algorithm which jointly proposes a new trajectory and parameter, and accepts or rejects both at once. PGibbs instead alternates between sampling from the trajectory, using an algorithm known as conditional sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC) and the parameter in a Hastings-within-Gibbs fashion. While particle independent Metropolis Hastings (PIMH), the parameter-free version of PMMH, is known to be statistically worse than CSMC, PGibbs can induce a slow mixing if the parameter and the state trajectory are very correlated. This has made PMMH the method of choice for many practitioners, despite theory and experiments favouring CSMC over PIMH for the parameter-free problem. In this article, we describe a formulation of PGibbs which bypasses the Gibbs step, essentially marginalizing over the trajectory distribution in a fashion similar to PMMH. This is achieved by considering the implementation of a CSMC algortihm for the state-space model integrated over the joint distribution of the current parameter and the parameter proposal. We illustrate the benefits of method on a simple example known to be challenging for PMMH.</p></details> | <details><summary>Feedb...</summary><p>Feedback most welcome. 12 pages, 1 figure.

This task faces significant challenges in scenarios involving overlapping or interacting objects: (1) Inaccurate localization of target objects due to attention misalignment, leading to incomplete or misplaced edits; (2) Attribute-object mismatch, where color or texture changes fail to align with intended regions due to cross-attention leakage, creating semantic conflicts (\textit{e.g.}, color bleeding into non-target areas). Existing methods struggle with these challenges: approaches relying on global cross-attention mechanisms suffer from attention dilution and spatial interference between objects, while mask-based methods fail to bind attributes to geometrically accurate regions due to feature entanglement in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, inference-stage optimization approach that enables precise localized image manipulation in complex multi-object scenes, named MDE-Edit. MDE-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models via two key losses: Object Alignment Loss (OAL) aligns multi-layer cross-attention with segmentation masks for precise object positioning, and Color Consistency Loss (CCL) amplifies target attribute attention within masks while suppressing leakage to adjacent regions. This dual-loss design ensures localized and coherent multi-object edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDE-Edit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing accuracy and visual quality, offering a robust solution for complex multi-object image manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PIDiff: Image Customization for Personalized Identities with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05081v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation for personalized identities aims at incorporating the specific identity into images using a text prompt and an identity image. Based on the powerful generative capabilities of DDPMs, many previous works adopt additional prompts, such as text embeddings and CLIP image embeddings, to represent the identity information, while they fail to disentangle the identity information and background information. As a result, the generated images not only lose key identity characteristics but also suffer from significantly reduced diversity. To address this issue, previous works have combined the W+ space from StyleGAN with diffusion models, leveraging this space to provide a more accurate and comprehensive representation of identity features through multi-level feature extraction. However, the entanglement of identity and background information in in-the-wild images during training prevents accurate identity localization, resulting in severe semantic interference between identity and background. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning-based diffusion model for personalized identities text-to-image generation, named PIDiff, which leverages the W+ space and an identity-tailored fine-tuning strategy to avoid semantic entanglement and achieves accurate feature extraction and localization. Style editing can also be achieved by PIDiff through preserving the characteristics of identity features in the W+ space, which vary from coarse to fine. Through the combination of the proposed cross-attention block and parameter optimization strategy, PIDiff preserves the identity information and maintains the generation capability for in-the-wild images of the pre-trained model during inference. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our method in this task.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |

In our formulation, each unit's potential outcome is modelled as a function $\tilde{y}_i(z, \omega)$, where $\omega$ denotes latent randomness external to the treatment assignment. Building on recent work that connects design-based estimation with the Riesz representation theorem, we construct causal estimators by embedding potential outcomes in a Hilbert space and defining treatment effects as linear functionals. This allows us to derive unbiased and consistent estimators, even when potential outcomes exhibit random variation. The framework retains the key advantage of design-based analysis, namely, the use of a known randomisation scheme for identification, while enabling inference in settings with inherent stochasticity. We establish large-sample properties under local dependence, provide a variance estimator compatible with sparse dependency structures, and illustrate the method through a simulation. Our results unify design-based reasoning with random-outcome modelling, broadening the applicability of causal inference in complex experimental environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 2 figures, 2 Tables, 2 Algorithms.

However, the computational efficiency of the model and the treatment of overlapping targets are the major challenges in the studies of this problem. To this end, a neural network model RepSNet was designed based on a nucleus boundary regression and a structural re-parameterization scheme for segmenting and classifying the nuclei in H\&E-stained histopathological images. First, RepSNet estimates the boundary position information (BPI) of the parent nucleus for each pixel. The BPI estimation incorporates the local information of the pixel and the contextual information of the parent nucleus. Then, the nucleus boundary is estimated by aggregating the BPIs from a series of pixels using a proposed boundary voting mechanism (BVM), and the instance segmentation results are computed from the estimated nucleus boundary using a connected component analysis procedure. The BVM intrinsically achieves a kind of synergistic belief enhancement among the BPIs from various pixels. Therefore, different from the methods available in literature that obtain nucleus boundaries based on a direct pixel recognition scheme, RepSNet computes its boundary decisions based on some guidances from macroscopic information using an integration mechanism. In addition, RepSNet employs a re-parametrizable encoder-decoder structure. This model can not only aggregate features from some receptive fields with various scales which helps segmentation accuracy improvement, but also reduce the parameter amount and computational burdens in the model inference phase through the structural re-parameterization technique. Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiorities of RepSNet compared to several typical benchmark models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This makes full automation with learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85% improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover, performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing state-of-the-art techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Synthesis, Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Methods, and Applications to Circuit Design (SMACD 2025). 4 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

The primary goal in DLP is for agents to reach a consensus on a unified coordinate system that accurately reflects the relative positions of all points, $p_0, ..., p_{n-1}$. Extensive research on DLP has primarily focused on the feasibility and complexity of achieving consensus when agents have limited access to inter-agent distances, often due to missing or imprecise data. In this paper, however, we examine a minimalist, computationally efficient model of distributed computing in which agents have access to all pairwise distances, if needed. Specifically, we introduce a novel variant of population protocols, referred to as the spatial population protocols model. In this variant each agent can memorise one or a fixed number of coordinates, and when agents $a_i$ and $a_j$ interact, they can not only exchange their current knowledge but also either determine the distance $d(i,j)$ between them in $S$ (distance query model) or obtain the vector $v(i,j)$ spanning points $p_i$ and $p_j$ (vector query model). We propose several localisation protocols, including: (1) Two leader-based protocols with distance queries, stabilizing silently in $o(n)$ time using an efficient multi-contact epidemic, a generalization of the one-way epidemic in population protocols; (2) A distance-based protocol self-stabilizing silently in $O(n(\log n/n)^{1/(k+1)}\log n)$ time in $k$-dimensions, leveraging a leader election mechanism; (3) An optimally fast protocol with vector queries, self-stabilizing silently in $O(\log n)$ time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a brief announcement for SAND 2025</p></details> |
| **[How to Infer Repeat Structures in MIDI Performances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05055v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MIDI performances are generally expedient in performance research and music information retrieval, and even more so if they can be connected to a score. This connection is usually established by means of alignment, linking either notes or time points between the score and the performance. The first obstacle when trying to establish such an alignment is that a performance realizes one (out of many) structural versions of the score that can plausibly result from instructions such as repeats, variations, and navigation markers like 'dal segno/da capo al coda'. A score needs to be unfolded, that is, its repeats and navigation markers need to be explicitly written out to create a single timeline without jumps matching the performance, before alignment algorithms can be applied. In the curation of large performance corpora this process is carried out manually, as no tools are available to infer the repeat structure of the performance. To ease this process, we develop a method to automatically infer the repeat structure of a MIDI performance, given a symbolically encoded score including repeat and navigation markers. The intuition guiding our design is: 1) local alignment of every contiguous section of the score with a section of a performance containing the same material should receive high alignment gain, whereas local alignment with any other performance section should accrue a low or zero gain. And 2) stitching local alignments together according to a valid structural version of the score should result in an approximate full alignment and correspondingly high global accumulated gain if the structural version corresponds to the performance, and low gain for all other, ill-fitting structural versions.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages, 1 figure, 1 table, to be published in the Music Encoding Conference 2025</p></details> |

For several tasks, quantifying the uncertainty of SAM is of particular interest. However, the ambiguous nature of the class-agnostic foundation model SAM challenges current uncertainty quantification (UQ) approaches. This paper presents a theoretically motivated uncertainty quantification model based on a Bayesian entropy formulation jointly respecting aleatoric, epistemic, and the newly introduced task uncertainty. We use this formulation to train USAM, a lightweight post-hoc UQ method. Our model traces the root of uncertainty back to under-parameterised models, insufficient prompts or image ambiguities. Our proposed deterministic USAM demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on the SA-V, MOSE, ADE20k, DAVIS, and COCO datasets, offering a computationally cheap and easy-to-use UQ alternative that can support user-prompting, enhance semi-supervised pipelines, or balance the tradeoff between accuracy and cost efficiency.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML'25 |

We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they still face practical deployment issues, such as high inference costs, limited accessibility of proprietary LCMs, and adaptability issues of ultra-large LCMs. These issues highlight the critical need for more accessible, lightweight yet effective LCMs. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, which transfers the programming capabilities of larger, advanced LCMs to smaller, less powerful LCMs. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Paced knOwledge DistillAtion framework, named SODA, aiming at developing lightweight yet effective student LCMs. SODA consists of three stages in one cycle: (1) Correct-and-Fault Knowledge Delivery stage aims at improving the student models capability to recognize errors while ensuring its basic programming skill during the knowledge transferring, which involves correctness-aware supervised learning and fault-aware contrastive learning methods. (2) Multi-View Feedback stage aims at measuring the quality of results generated by the student model from two views, including model-based and static tool-based measurement, for identifying the difficult questions. (3) Feedback-based Knowledge Update stage aims at updating the student model adaptively by generating new questions at different difficulty levels, in which the difficulty levels are categorized based on the feedback in the second stage. Experimental results show that SODA improves the student model by 65.96% in terms of average Pass@1, outperforming the best baseline by 29.85%. Based on the SODA framework, we develop SodaCoder, a series of lightweight yet effective LCMs, which outperform 15 LCMs with less than or equal to 16B parameters. Notably, SodaCoder-DS-6.7B, built on DeepseekCoder-6.7B, even surpasses the prominent ChatGPT on average Pass@1.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |

However, existing dataset pruning methods require training on the entire dataset, which is impractical for large-scale pre-trained models. In this paper, we propose a straightforward, novel, and training-free hardness score named Distorting-based Learning Complexity (DLC), to identify informative images and instructions from the downstream dataset efficiently. Our method is motivated by the observation that easy samples learned faster can also be learned with fewer parameters. Specifically, we define the Learning Complexity to quantify sample hardness and utilize a lightweight weights masking process for fast estimation, instead of the costly SGD optimization. Based on DLC, we further design a flexible under-sampling with randomness (dubbed FlexRand), replacing the top-K strategy, to alleviate the severe subset distribution shift. Extensive experiments with downstream image and instructions dataset pruning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. In the images pruning benchmark, DLC significantly reduces the pruning time by 35x while establishing state-of-the-art performance with FlexRand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

A/B testing is the predominant method for determining which UI variations drive higher user engagement, but it is costly and time-consuming. While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process automated UI analysis, current approaches focus on isolated design attributes rather than comparative persuasiveness-the key factor in optimizing user interactions. To address this, we introduce WiserUI-Bench, a benchmark designed for Pairwise UI Design Persuasiveness Assessment task, featuring 300 real-world UI image pairs labeled with A/B test results and expert rationales. Additionally, we propose G-FOCUS, a novel inference-time reasoning strategy that enhances VLM-based persuasiveness assessment by reducing position bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Experimental results show that G-FOCUS surpasses existing inference strategies in consistency and accuracy for pairwise UI evaluation. Through promoting VLM-driven evaluation of UI persuasiveness, our work offers an approach to complement A/B testing, propelling progress in scalable UI preference modeling and design optimization.

Workloads such as chain-of-thought, complex reasoning, and agent services significantly increase the inference cost by invoking the model repeatedly. Optimization methods such as parallelism, compression, and caching have been adopted to reduce costs, but the diverse service requirements make it hard to select the right method. Recently, specialized LLM inference engines have emerged as a key component for integrating the optimization methods into service-oriented infrastructures. However, a systematic study on inference engines is still lacking. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of 25 open-source and commercial inference engines. We examine each inference engine in terms of ease-of-use, ease-of-deployment, general-purpose support, scalability, and suitability for throughput- and latency-aware computation. Furthermore, we explore the design goals of each inference engine by investigating the optimization techniques it supports. In addition, we assess the ecosystem maturity of open source inference engines and handle the performance and cost policy of commercial solutions. We outline future research directions that include support for complex LLM-based services, support of various hardware, and enhanced security, offering practical guidance to researchers and developers in selecting and designing optimized LLM inference engines.

They significantly outperform the best fast-thinking models, such as GPT-4o, on various math and science benchmarks. However, their multimodal reasoning capabilities remain on par with fast-thinking models. For instance, GPT-o1's performance on benchmarks like MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision is similar to fast-thinking models. In this paper, we aim to enhance the slow-thinking capabilities of vision-language models using reinforcement learning (without relying on distillation) to advance the state of the art. First, we adapt the GRPO algorithm with a novel technique called Selective Sample Replay (SSR) to address the vanishing advantages problem. While this approach yields strong performance, the resulting RL-trained models exhibit limited self-reflection or self-verification. To further encourage slow-thinking, we introduce Forced Rethinking, which appends a rethinking trigger token to the end of rollouts in RL training, explicitly enforcing a self-reflection reasoning step. By combining these two techniques, our model, VL-Rethinker, advances state-of-the-art scores on MathVista, MathVerse to achieve 80.4%, 63.5% respectively. VL-Rethinker also achieves open-source SoTA on multi-disciplinary benchmarks such as MathVision, MMMU-Pro, EMMA, and MEGA-Bench, narrowing the gap with OpenAI-o1. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | Preprint |

It constructs a structured causal graph to analyze the model inference process, and performs backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounding paths. Specifically, we design an intra-client deconfounding learning module for computer vision tasks to decouple background and objects, generating counterfactual samples that establish a connection between the background and any label, which stops the model from using the background to infer the label. Moreover, we design an inter-client debiasing learning module to construct causal prototypes to reduce the proportion of the background in prototype components. Notably, it bridges the gap between heterogeneous representations via causal prototypical regularization. Extensive experiments on 2 benchmarking datasets demonstrate that \methodname{} significantly enhances the model capability to focus on main objects in unseen data, leading to 4.5\% higher Top-1 Accuracy on average over 9 state-of-the-art existing methods.</p></details> | IJCAI-25 Accepted |
| **[Optimizing LLMs for Resource-Constrained Environments: A Survey of Model Compression Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02309v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized many areas of artificial intelligence (AI), but their substantial resource requirements limit their deployment on mobile and edge devices. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of techniques for compressing LLMs to enable efficient inference in resource-constrained environments. We examine three primary approaches: Knowledge Distillation, Model Quantization, and Model Pruning. For each technique, we discuss the underlying principles, present different variants, and provide examples of successful applications. We also briefly discuss complementary techniques such as mixture-of-experts and early-exit strategies. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, aiming to provide a valuable resource for both researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize LLMs for edge deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE COMPSAC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Look Twice Before You Answer: Memory-Space Visual Retracing for Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03577v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., the generated content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to input sources. Unlike in LLMs, hallucinations in MLLMs often stem from the sensitivity of text decoder to visual tokens, leading to a phenomenon akin to "amnesia" about visual information. To address this issue, we propose MemVR, a novel decoding paradigm inspired by common cognition: when the memory of an image seen the moment before is forgotten, people will look at it again for factual answers. Following this principle, we treat visual tokens as supplementary evidence, re-injecting them into the MLLM through Feed Forward Network (FFN) as "key-value memory" at the middle trigger layer. This "look-twice" mechanism occurs when the model exhibits high uncertainty during inference, effectively enhancing factual alignment. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MemVR significantly mitigates hallucination across various MLLMs and excels in general benchmarks without incurring additional time overhead. The implementation is available from https://github.com/1zhou-Wang/MemVR</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning stochastic dynamics from snapshots through regularized unbalanced optimal transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844v5)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025 (oral)</p></details> |

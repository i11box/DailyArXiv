| **[Human3R: Everyone Everywhere All at Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06219v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies ("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning, to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R</p></details> | <details><summary>Page:...</summary><p>Page: https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R Code: https://github.com/fanegg/Human3R</p></details> |
| **[Fine-grained Defocus Blur Control for Generative Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06215v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse, high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data, which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth, predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer, and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents, which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without altering the depicted scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project link: https://www.ayshrv.com/defocus-blur-gen</p></details> |
| **[Drive&Gen: Co-Evaluating End-to-End Driving and Video Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06209v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[ShapeGen4D: Towards High Quality 4D Shape Generation from Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06208v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://shapegen4d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EmbodiedCoder: Parameterized Embodied Mobile Manipulation via Modern Coding Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06207v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in control robot methods, from end-to-end vision-language-action frameworks to modular systems with predefined primitives, have advanced robots' ability to follow natural language instructions. Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse environments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited interpretability.In this work, we introduce EmbodiedCoder, a training-free framework for open-world mobile robot manipulation that leverages coding models to directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level instructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry parameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data collection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and generalizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real mobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across diverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and environments.Our results demonstrate an interpretable approach for bridging high-level reasoning and low-level control, moving beyond fixed primitives toward versatile robot intelligence.

| **[An algebra modality admitting countably many deriving transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03953v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category, that is, a symmetric monoidal category enriched over commutative monoids, with an algebra modality, axiomatizing smooth functions, and a deriving transformation on this algebra modality, axiomatizing differentiation. Lemay proved that a comonoidal algebra modality has at most one deriving transformation, thus differentiation is unique in models of differential linear logic. It was then an open problem whether this result extends to arbitrary algebra modalities. We answer this question in the negative. We build a free "commutative rig with a self-map" algebra modality on the category of commutative monoids, where the self-map can be seen as an arbitrary smooth function. We then define a countable family of distinct deriving transformations $({}_{n}\mathsf{d})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this algebra modality where the parameter $n$ controls the derivative of the self-map. It shows that in a differential category, a single algebra modality may admit multiple, inequivalent notions of differentiation.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages.

| **[Generative Interfaces for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19227v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots, and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces (UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks, interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces consistently outperform conversational ones, with up to a 72% improvement in human preference. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Hierarchical Reasoning Models: Perspectives and Misconceptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00355v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential, autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models, but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et. al., 2025), which introduces a novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers, achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls for in-depth investigation. In this work, we review this class of models, examine key design choices, test alternative variants and clarify common misconceptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Found...</summary><p>Found errors in some results of v1.

| **[Tracing Multilingual Factual Knowledge Acquisition in Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14824v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of recalling multilingual factual knowledge present in their pretraining data. However, most studies evaluate only the final model, leaving the development of factual recall and crosslingual consistency throughout pretraining largely unexplored. In this work, we trace how factual recall and crosslingual consistency evolve during pretraining, focusing on OLMo-7B as a case study. We find that both accuracy and consistency improve over time for most languages. We show that this improvement is primarily driven by the fact frequency in the pretraining corpus: more frequent facts are more likely to be recalled correctly, regardless of language. Yet, some low-frequency facts in non-English languages can still be correctly recalled. Our analysis reveals that these instances largely benefit from crosslingual transfer of their English counterparts -- an effect that emerges predominantly in the early stages of pretraining. We pinpoint two distinct pathways through which multilingual factual knowledge acquisition occurs: (1) frequency-driven learning, which is dominant and language-agnostic, and (2) crosslingual transfer, which is limited in scale and typically constrained to relation types involving named entities. We release our code and data to facilitate further research at https://github.com/cisnlp/multilingual-fact-tracing.</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |
| **[TokenChain: A Discrete Speech Chain via Semantic Token Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06201v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight averaging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and cross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by 31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains effective with token interfaces and models.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

| **[DYMO-Hair: Generalizable Volumetric Dynamics Modeling for Robot Hair Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06199v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments.

| **[Peeking inside the Black-Box: Reinforcement Learning for Explainable and Accurate Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06198v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54% (relative).</p></details> | Working in process |

| **[Latent Speech-Text Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06195v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further research.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

This work presents a compact end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%), while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and practical iris recognition on smartphones.</p></details> | <details><summary>We bu...</summary><p>We build upon our earlier work, arXiv:2412.13063</p></details> |

Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>techn...</summary><p>technical report, project url:https://onecat-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work we study scaling laws using multiple architectural shapes and hyperparameter choices, highlighting their impact on resulting prescriptions. As a primary artifact of our research, we release the Gemstones: an open-source scaling law dataset, consisting of over 4000 checkpoints from transformers with up to 2 billion parameters and diverse architectural shapes; including ablations over learning rate and cooldown. Our checkpoints enable more complex studies of scaling, such as analyzing the relationship between width and depth. By examining our model suite, we find that the prescriptions of scaling laws can be highly sensitive to the experimental design process and the specific model checkpoints used during fitting.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Parallel Tokenizers: Rethinking Vocabulary Design for Cross-Lingual Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06128v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However, existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation learning--especially in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 25 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Downsized and Compromised?: Assessing the Faithfulness of Model Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06125v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, computational constraints often require transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to and under review at Springer Machine Learning Journal</p></details> |

Our approach leverages the Clarke transform, the Euler-Lagrange formalism, and the piecewise constant curvature assumption to formulate a dynamic model on a two-dimensional manifold embedded in the joint space that inherently satisfies tendon constraints. We present linear and constraint-informed controllers that operate directly on this manifold, along with practical methods for preventing negative tendon forces without compromising control fidelity. This opens up new design possibilities for overactuated TDCRs with improved force distribution and stiffness without increasing controller complexity. We validate these approaches in simulation and on a physical prototype with one segment and five tendons, demonstrating accurate dynamic behavior and robust trajectory tracking under real-time conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025), 8 pages, and 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[CAMERA: Multi-Matrix Joint Compression for MoE Models via Micro-Expert Redundancy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02322v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding. Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This often leads to unrealistic or physically implausible movements with inadequate structural coherence. To conquer these challenges, we propose MoSA, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components, i.e., structure generation and appearance generation. MoSA first employs a 3D structure transformer to generate a human motion sequence from the text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of this structural sequence. We achieve fine-grained control over the sparse human structures by introducing Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules with a dense tracking constraint during training. The modeling of human-environment interactions is improved through the proposed contact constraint. Those two components work comprehensively to ensure the structural and appearance fidelity across the generated videos. This paper also contributes a large-scale human video dataset, which features more complex and diverse motions than existing human video datasets. We conduct comprehensive comparisons between MoSA and a variety of approaches, including general video generation models, human video generation models, and human animation models. Experiments demonstrate that MoSA substantially outperforms existing approaches across the majority of evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://hywang2002.github.io/MoSA</p></details> |
| **[A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08477v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific "trigger" arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps of 0.77% and 0.40% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced solutions 11.3% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints. The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures.

| **[ARISE: An Adaptive Resolution-Aware Metric for Test-Time Scaling Evaluation in Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06014v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary reasoning models.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MASA: Rethinking the Representational Bottleneck in LoRA with Multi-A Shared Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06005v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix ($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA, these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models. Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads. We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments. This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of arXiv:2304.10196 which, apart from providing full proofs of all statements, takes a more categorical point of view to tell the whole story.

| **[Diffusion-Based Image Editing for Breaking Robust Watermarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05978v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes, resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in the era of generative AI.</p></details> | Preprint |

An Analysis of MetaFormer's Token Mixing for Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05971v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets, its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images. Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/multimodallearning/MetaFormerMedImaging/tree/clean_code</p></details> |
| **[Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22284v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences; a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter training.

| **[Enhancing Fitness Movement Recognition with Attention Mechanism and Pre-Trained Feature Extractors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02511v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention. These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset, achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration. Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,9 figures, 2025 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)</p></details> |

Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to real-world perturbations.

However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work, we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of 1,740 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated question answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for scene text spotting and understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Oracle Separations for RPH](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09279v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While theoretical computer science primarily works with discrete models of computation, like the Turing machine and the wordRAM, there are many scenarios in which introducing real computation models is more adequate. We want to compare real models of computation with discrete models of computation. We do this by means of oracle separation results. We define the notion of a real Turing machine as an extension of the (binary) Turing machine by adding a real tape. Using those machines, we define and study the real polynomial hierarchy RPH. We are interested in RPH as the first level of the hierarchy corresponds to the well-known complexity class ER. It is known that $NP \subseteq ER \subseteq PSPACE$ and furthermore $PH \subseteq RPH \subseteq PSPACE$. We are interested to know if any of those inclusions are tight. In the absence of unconditional separations of complexity classes, we turn to oracle separation. We develop a technique that allows us to transform oracle separation results from the binary world to the real world. As applications, we show there are oracles such that: - $RPH^O$ proper subset of $PSPACE^O$, - $\Sigma_{k+1}^O$ not contained in $\Sigma_kR^O$, for all $k\geq 0$, - $\Sigma_kR^O$ proper subset of $\Sigma_{k+1}R^O$, for all $k\geq 0$, - $BQP^O$ not contained in $RPH^O$. Our results hint that ER is strictly contained in PSPACE and that there is a separation between the different levels of the real polynomial hierarchy. We also bound the power of real computations by showing that NP-hard problems are unlikely to be solvable using polynomial time on a realRAM. Furthermore, our oracle separations hint that polynomial-time quantum computing cannot be simulated on an efficient real Turing machine.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 3 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Vision Transformers for Enhanced Classification of Emotions using ECG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05826v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical signals provide insights into various conditions affecting the human body. Beyond diagnostic capabilities, these signals offer a deeper understanding of how specific organs respond to an individual's emotions and feelings. For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability linked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system activity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We begin by assessing the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a forefront model in image classification, for identifying emotions in imaged ECGs. Following this, we present and evaluate an improved version of ViT, integrating both CNN and SE blocks, aiming to bolster performance on imaged ECGs associated with emotion detection. Our method unfolds in two critical phases: first, we apply advanced preprocessing techniques for signal purification and converting signals into interpretable images using continuous wavelet transform and power spectral density analysis; second, we unveil a performance-boosted vision transformer architecture, cleverly enhanced with convolutional neural network components, to adeptly tackle the challenges of emotion recognition. Our methodology's robustness and innovation were thoroughly tested using ECG data from the YAAD and DREAMER datasets, leading to remarkable outcomes. For the YAAD dataset, our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in classifying seven unique emotional states, as well as in valence and arousal classification. Similarly, in the DREAMER dataset, our method excelled in distinguishing between valence, arousal and dominance, surpassing current leading techniques.</p></details> | 14pages, 2 figures |
| **[Möbius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05786v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.</p></details> | 43 pages, 2 figures |

Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the \textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode \textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers, we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting -- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.</p></details> | 28 |
| **[Text Clustering as Classification with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00927v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text clustering serves as a fundamental technique for organizing and interpreting unstructured textual data, particularly in contexts where manual annotation is prohibitively costly. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their demonstrated effectiveness across a broad spectrum of NLP tasks, an emerging body of research has begun to explore their potential in the domain of text clustering. However, existing LLM-based approaches still rely on fine-tuned embedding models and sophisticated similarity metrics, rendering them computationally intensive and necessitating domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that reframes text clustering as a classification task by harnessing the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs. Our framework eliminates the need for fine-tuning embedding models or intricate clustering algorithms. It comprises two key steps: first, the LLM is prompted to generate a set of candidate labels based on the dataset and then merges semantically similar labels; second, it assigns the most appropriate label to each text sample. By leveraging the advanced natural language understanding and generalization capabilities of LLMs, the proposed approach enables effective clustering with minimal human intervention. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art embedding-based clustering techniques, while significantly reducing computational complexity and resource requirements. These findings underscore the transformative potential of LLMs in simplifying and enhancing text clustering tasks. We make our code available to the public for utilization at https://github.com/ECNU-Text-Computing/Text-Clustering-via-LLM.

| **[Cat: Post-Training Quantization Error Reduction via Cluster-based Affine Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26277v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision (FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit). Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs, worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters, without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation alongside the publication of this paper.</p></details> | 29 pages, 20 figures |

Traditional data augmentation techniques often face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot semantic segmentation.</p></details> | Tech report |

Yet, this capability remains largely unexplored to date. In this paper, we develop a generative location model that, given an object class and an image, learns to predict plausible bounding boxes for such an object. Our approach first tokenizes the image and target object class, then decodes bounding box coordinates through an autoregressive transformer. This formulation effectively addresses two core challenges in locatio modeling: the inherent one-to-many nature of plausible locations, and the sparsity of existing location modeling datasets, where fewer than 1% of valid placements are labeled. Furthermore, we incorporate Direct Preference Optimization to leverage negative labels, refining the spatial predictions. Empirical evaluations reveal that our generative location model achieves superior placement accuracy on the OPA dataset as compared to discriminative baselines and image composition approaches. We further test our model in the context of object insertion, where it proposes locations for an off-the-shelf inpainting model to render objects. In this respect, our proposal exhibits improved visual coherence relative to state-of-the-art instruction-tuned editing methods, demonstrating a high-performing location model's utility in a downstream application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 DRL4Real Workshop</p></details> |

For constructing HOVE we introduce square-squeezing --a homeomorphic multilinear hypercube-simplex transformation reparametrizing an initial flat triangulation of the manifold to a cubical mesh. By employing square-squeezing, we approximate the integrand and the volume element for each hypercube domain of the reparameterized mesh through interpolation in Chebyshev-Lobatto grids. This strategy circumvents the Runge phenomenon, replacing the initial integral with a closed-form expression that can be precisely computed by high-order quadratures. We prove novel bounds of the integration error in terms of the $r^\text{th}$-order total variation of the integrand and the surface parameterization, predicting high algebraic approximation rates that scale solely with the interpolation degree and not, as is common, with the average simplex size. For smooth integrals whose total variation is constantly bounded with increasing $r$, the estimates prove the integration error to decrease even exponentially, while mesh refinements are limited to achieve algebraic rates. The resulting approximation power is demonstrated in several numerical experiments, particularly showcasing $p$-refinements to overcome the limitations of $h$-refinements for highly varying smooth integrals.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 17 figures.

| **[A Hierarchical Geometry-guided Transformer for Histological Subtyping of Primary Liver Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05657v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, accepted by IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |

The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer rich physical context from the text prompt. To incorporate this context into the video diffusion model, we use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to verify intermediate latent variables against the inferred physical rules, guiding the gradient updates of model accordingly. Textual output of LLM is transformed into continuous signals. We then formulate a set of training objectives that jointly ensure physical accuracy and semantic alignment with the input text. Additionally, failure facts of physical phenomena are corrected via attention injection. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

As the backbone of wideband communication, optical networks are expecting high-level autonomous operation and zero-touch management to accommodate their expanding network scales and escalating transmission bandwidth. The integration of GenAI is deemed as the pivotal solution for realizing zero-touch optical networks. However, the lifecycle management of optical networks involves a multitude of tasks and necessitates seamless collaboration across multiple layers, which poses significant challenges to the existing single-agent GenAI systems. In this paper, we propose a GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent framework designed to streamline multi-task autonomous execution for zero-touch optical networks. We present the architecture, implementation, and applications of this framework. A field-deployed mesh network is utilized to demonstrate three typical scenarios throughout the lifecycle of optical network: quality of transmission estimation in the planning stage, dynamic channel adding/dropping in the operation stage, and system capacity increase in the upgrade stage. The case studies, illustrate the capabilities of multi-agent framework in multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization. This work provides a promising approach for the future development of intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management solutions, paving the way for more specialized and adaptive zero-touch optical networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages,6 figures, Accepted by lEEE Communications Magazine, Open call</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a novel text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data, which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth, predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer, and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents, which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without altering the depicted scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project link: https://www.ayshrv.com/defocus-blur-gen</p></details> |
| **[Latent Speech-Text Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06195v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference, and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further research.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

However, these methods remain computationally intensive, particularly in complex environments that require many collision checks. To improve performance, recent efforts have explored parallelizing specific components of RRT such as collision checking, or running multiple planners independently. However, little has been done to develop an integrated parallelism approach, co-designed for large-scale parallelism. In this work we present pRRTC, a RRT-Connect based planner co-designed for GPU acceleration across the entire algorithm through parallel expansion and SIMT-optimized collision checking. We evaluate the effectiveness of pRRTC on the MotionBenchMaker dataset using robots with 7, 8, and 14 degrees of freedom (DoF). Compared to the state-of-the-art, pRRTC achieves as much as a 10x speedup on constrained reaching tasks with a 5.4x reduction in standard deviation. pRRTC also achieves a 1.4x reduction in average initial path cost. Finally, we deploy pRRTC on a 14-DoF dual Franka Panda arm setup and demonstrate real-time, collision-free motion planning with dynamic obstacles. We open-source our planner to support the wider community.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>techn...</summary><p>technical report, project url:https://onecat-ai.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CreditDecoding: Accelerating Parallel Decoding in Diffusion Large Language Models with Trace Credits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06133v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit. This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct. Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily integrable and versatile solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,8 figures,4 tables</p></details> |

Running LLMs locally on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight, online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill, decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference, quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM systems.

| **[Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06113v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[The Alignment Auditor: A Bayesian Framework for Verifying and Refining LLM Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06096v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single, overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy and accountable AI.</p></details> | Preprint |

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers real-time, high-fidelity rendering, its performance drastically deteriorates under sparse inputs, plagued by floating artifacts and structural failures. To address these challenges, we introduce HBSplat, a unified framework that elevates 3DGS by seamlessly integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our core contributions are threefold: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that ensures multi-view consistency by leveraging dense matching priors and integrating reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method that enforces substantially stronger constraints by creating high-fidelity virtual views through bidirectional depth-image warping and multi-view fusion; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that recovers occluded areas using a depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model. Extensive evaluations on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks validate that HBSplat sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference. Code is available at: https://github.com/eternalland/HBSplat.</p></details> | 14 pages, 21 figures |

While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025, Project page: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/video-ver/</p></details> |

Previous studies have primarily addressed this issue through value decomposition methods under the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm, where neural networks are utilized to approximate the nonlinear relationship between individual Q-values and the global Q-value. Although these approaches have achieved considerable success in various benchmark tasks, they still suffer from several limitations, including imprecise attribution of contributions, limited interpretability, and poor scalability in high-dimensional state spaces. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, \textbf{QLLM}, which facilitates the automatic construction of credit assignment functions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the concept of \textbf{TFCAF} is introduced, wherein the credit allocation process is represented as a direct and expressive nonlinear functional formulation. A custom-designed \textit{coder-evaluator} framework is further employed to guide the generation, verification, and refinement of executable code by LLMs, significantly mitigating issues such as hallucination and shallow reasoning during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on several standard MARL benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, QLLM exhibits strong generalization capability and maintains compatibility with a wide range of MARL algorithms that utilize mixing networks, positioning it as a promising and versatile solution for complex multi-agent scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are withdrawing this manuscript due to experimental errors and mistakes in data preprocessing.

This article provides theoretical guarantees by exploring the fundamental statistical limitations associated with MIAs on machine learning models at large. More precisely, we first derive the statistical quantity that governs the effectiveness and success of such attacks. We then theoretically prove that in a non-linear regression setting with overfitting learning procedures, attacks may have a high probability of success. Finally, we investigate several situations for which we provide bounds on this quantity of interest. Interestingly, our findings indicate that discretizing the data might enhance the learning procedure's security. Specifically, it is demonstrated to be limited by a constant, which quantifies the diversity of the underlying data distribution. We illustrate those results through simple simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in JMLR</p></details> |

This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation estimates of model performance.

Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS2025.

However, as the landscape of reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary reasoning models.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

In this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone, our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes, and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Recent studies address this issue by distilling diffusion models into consistency models, enabling efficient one-step generation. However, these approaches introduce additional training costs and rely heavily on the performance of pre-trained teacher models. In this paper, we propose ECTSpeech, a simple and effective one-step speech synthesis framework that, for the first time, incorporates the Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT) strategy into speech synthesis. By progressively tightening consistency constraints on a pre-trained diffusion model, ECTSpeech achieves high-quality one-step generation while significantly reducing training complexity. In addition, we design a multi-scale gate module (MSGate) to enhance the denoiser's ability to fuse features at different scales. Experimental results on the LJSpeech dataset demonstrate that ECTSpeech achieves audio quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods under single-step sampling, while substantially reducing the model's training cost and complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by Proceedings of the 2025 ACM Multimedia Asia Conference(MMAsia '25)</p></details> |
| **[Fast-Convergent Proximity Graphs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05975v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional metric spaces is a fundamental problem with many applications. Over the past decade, proximity graph (PG)-based indexes have demonstrated superior empirical performance over alternatives. However, these methods often lack theoretical guarantees regarding the quality of query results, especially in the worst-case scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the {\alpha}-convergent graph ({\alpha}-CG), a new PG structure that employs a carefully designed edge pruning rule. This rule eliminates candidate neighbors for each data point p by applying the shifted-scaled triangle inequalities among p, its existing out-neighbors, and new candidates. If the distance between the query point q and its exact nearest neighbor v* is at most {\tau} for some constant {\tau} > 0, our {\alpha}-CG finds the exact nearest neighbor in poly-logarithmic time, assuming bounded intrinsic dimensionality for the dataset; otherwise, it can find an ANN in the same time. To enhance scalability, we develop the {\alpha}-convergent neighborhood graph ({\alpha}-CNG), a practical variant that applies the pruning rule locally within each point's neighbors. We also introduce optimizations to reduce the index construction time. Experimental results show that our {\alpha}-CNG outperforms existing PGs on real-world datasets. For most datasets, {\alpha}-CNG can reduce the number of distance computations and search steps by over 15% and 45%, respectively, when compared with the best-performing baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM SIGMOD 2025.

| **[Distributed Platoon Control Under Quantization: Stability Analysis and Privacy Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05959v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed control of connected and automated vehicles has attracted considerable interest for its potential to improve traffic efficiency and safety. However, such control schemes require sharing privacy-sensitive vehicle data, which introduces risks of information leakage and potential malicious activities. This paper investigates the stability and privacy-preserving properties of distributed platoon control under two types of quantizers: deterministic and probabilistic. For deterministic quantization, we show that the resulting control strategy ensures the system errors remain uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, in the absence of auxiliary information, an eavesdropper cannot uniquely infer sensitive vehicle states. In contrast, the use of probabilistic quantization enables asymptotic convergence of the vehicle platoon in expectation with bounded variance. Importantly, probabilistic quantizers can satisfy differential privacy guarantees, thereby preserving privacy even when the eavesdropper possesses arbitrary auxiliary information. We further analyze the trade-off between control performance and privacy by formulating an optimization problem that characterizes the impact of the quantization step on both metrics. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the performance differences between the two quantization strategies.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Fine-Grained and Thematic Evaluation of LLMs in Social Deduction Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09946v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have investigated whether large language models (LLMs) can support obscured communication, which is characterized by core aspects such as inferring subtext and evading suspicions. To conduct the investigation, researchers have used social deduction games (SDGs) as their experimental environment, in which players conceal and infer specific information. However, prior work has often overlooked how LLMs should be evaluated in such settings. Specifically, we point out two limitations with the evaluation methods they employed. First, metrics used in prior studies are coarse-grained as they are based on overall game outcomes that often fail to capture event-level behaviors; Second, error analyses have lacked structured methodologies capable of producing insights that meaningfully support evaluation outcomes. To address these limitations, we propose a microscopic and systematic approach to the investigation. Specifically, we introduce six fine-grained metrics that resolve the first issue. To tackle the second issue, we conducted a thematic analysis and identified four major reasoning failures that undermine LLMs' performance in obscured communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[A subsampling approach for large data sets when the Generalised Linear Model is potentially misspecified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05902v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subsampling is a computationally efficient and scalable method to draw inference in large data settings based on a subset of the data rather than needing to consider the whole dataset. When employing subsampling techniques, a crucial consideration is how to select an informative subset based on the queries posed by the data analyst. A recently proposed method for this purpose involves randomly selecting samples from the large dataset based on subsampling probabilities. However, a major drawback of this approach is that the derived subsampling probabilities are typically based on an assumed statistical model which may be difficult to correctly specify in practice. To address this limitation, we propose to determine subsampling probabilities based on a statistical model that we acknowledge may be misspecified. To do so, we propose to evaluate the subsampling probabilities based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the predictions from a model that is not assumed to completely describe the large dataset. We apply our subsampling approach in a simulation study and for the analysis of two real-world large datasets, where its performance is benchmarked against existing subsampling techniques. The findings suggest that there is value in adopting our approach over current practice.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[MaNGO - Adaptable Graph Network Simulators via Meta-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05874v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties, demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle model.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages including appendix.

| **[Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI via RST-Enhanced Graph Fusion and Interpretability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12324v3)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm: CDCL-NLI, which extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 25,410 instances and spanning 26 languages. To address the limitations of previous methods on CDCL-NLI task, we further propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion with interpretability-aware prediction. Our approach leverages RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) within heterogeneous graph neural networks for cross-document context modeling, and employs a structure-aware semantic alignment based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU (Elementary Discourse Unit)-level attribution framework that produces extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both conventional NLI models as well as large language models. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, hallucination elimination and interpretability inference.

We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Aligning Language Models with Real-time Knowledge Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01302v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs) efficiently while retaining their original capabilities. Mainstream benchmarks for knowledge editing are predominantly static and fail to keep in pace with the evolving real-world knowledge. In this work, we introduce CRAFT, an ever-evolving real-world benchmark for knowledge editing. It features well-designed paired edits for composite reasoning, and evaluates models on alias portability as well as temporal and common-sense locality, making it a challenging knowledge editing benchmark on which previous knowledge editing methods hardly achieve balanced performance. Towards flexible real-time editing, we propose KEDAS, a novel paradigm of knowledge editing alignment featuring diverse edit augmentation and self-adaptive post-alignment inference, which exhibits significant performance gain on CRAFT compared to previous methods.

| **[Fast Policy Learning for Linear Quadratic Control with Entropy Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14168v4)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes and analyzes two new policy learning methods: regularized policy gradient (RPG) and iterative policy optimization (IPO), for a class of discounted linear-quadratic control (LQC) problems over an infinite time horizon with entropy regularization. Assuming access to the exact policy evaluation, both proposed approaches are proven to converge linearly in finding optimal policies of the regularized LQC. Moreover, the IPO method can achieve a super-linear convergence rate once it enters a local region around the optimal policy. Finally, when the optimal policy for an RL problem with a known environment is appropriately transferred as the initial policy to an RL problem with an unknown environment, the IPO method is shown to enable a super-linear convergence rate if the two environments are sufficiently close. Performances of these proposed algorithms are supported by numerical examples.</p></details> | 31 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Inequality Constrained Minimum Density Power Divergence Estimation in Panel Count Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21534v4)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of panel count data has garnered considerable attention in the literature, leading to the development of multiple statistical techniques. In inferential analysis, most works focus on leveraging estimating equation-based techniques or conventional maximum likelihood estimation. However, the robustness of these methods is largely questionable. In this paper, we present a robust density power divergence estimation method for panel count data arising from non-homogeneous Poisson processes correlated through a latent frailty variable. To cope with real-world incidents, it is often desirable to impose certain inequality constraints on the parameter space, leading to the constrained minimum density power divergence estimator. Being incorporated with inequality restrictions, coupled with the inherent complexity of our objective function, standard computational algorithms are inadequate for estimation purposes. To overcome this, we adopt sequential convex programming, which approximates the original problem through a series of subproblems. Further, we study the asymptotic properties of the resultant estimator, making a significant contribution to this work. The proposed method ensures high efficiency in the model estimation while providing reliable inference despite data contamination. Moreover, the density power divergence measure is governed by a tuning parameter $\gamma$, which controls the trade-off between robustness and efficiency. To effectively determine the optimal value of $\gamma$, this study employs a generalized score-matching technique, marking considerable progress in the data analysis. Simulation studies and real data examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the estimator and to substantiate the theory developed.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 Pa...</summary><p>58 Pages, 12 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Neuron Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05781v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency in MoE-like models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 page, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Expected Free Energy-based Planning as Variational Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14898v4)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of planning under uncertainty, where an agent must choose actions that not only achieve desired outcomes but also reduce uncertainty. Traditional methods often treat exploration and exploitation as separate objectives, lacking a unified inferential foundation. Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking. However, the computational burden of EFE minimization had remained a significant obstacle to its scalability. In this paper, we show that EFE-based planning arises naturally from minimizing a variational free energy functional on a generative model augmented with preference and epistemic priors. This result reinforces theoretical consistency with the Free Energy Principle by casting planning under uncertainty itself as a form of variational inference. Our formulation yields policies that jointly support goal achievement and information gain, while incorporating a complexity term that accounts for bounded computational resources. This unifying framework connects and extends existing methods, enabling scalable, resource-aware implementations of active inference agents.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Early Multimodal Prediction of Cross-Lingual Meme Virality on Reddit: A Time-Window Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05761v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale, cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust, data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score, learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive, multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially, useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable, contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme virality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint work in progress.

| **[Empirical Comparison of Membership Inference Attacks in Deep Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05753v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation. We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 13 figures, published in TMLR https://openreview.net/forum?id=UligTUCgdt</p></details> |
| **[Assessing (im)balance in signed brain networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00542v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many complex systems - be they financial, natural or social - are composed by units - such as stocks, neurons or agents - whose joint activity can be represented as a multivariate time series. An issue of both practical and theoretical importance concerns the possibility of inferring the presence of a static relationships between any two units solely from their dynamic state. The present contribution aims at tackling such an issue within the frame of traditional hypothesis testing: briefly speaking, our suggestion is that of linking any two units if behaving in a sufficiently similar way. To achieve such a goal, we project a multivariate time series onto a signed graph by i) comparing the empirical properties of the former with those expected under a suitable benchmark and ii) linking any two units with a positive (negative) edge in case the corresponding series share a significantly large number of concordant (discordant) values. To define our benchmarks, we adopt an information-theoretic approach that is rooted into the constrained maximisation of Shannon entropy, a procedure inducing an ensemble of multivariate time series that preserves some of the empirical properties on average while randomising everything else. We showcase the possible applications of our method by addressing one of the most timely issues in the domain of neurosciences, i.e. that of determining if brain networks are frustrated or not - and, in case, to what extent. As our results suggest, this is indeed the case, the structure of the negative subgraph being more prone to inter-subject variability than the complementary, positive subgraph. At the mesoscopic level, instead, the minimisation of the Bayesian Information Criterion instantiated with the Signed Stochastic Block Model reveals that brain areas gather into modules aligning with the statistical variant of the Relaxed Balance Theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks on Tokenizers of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05699v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/mengtong0110/Tokenizer-MIA</p></details> |

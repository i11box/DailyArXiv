| **[T2I-R1: Reinforcing Image Generation with Collaborative Semantic-level and Token-level CoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00703v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated how chain-of-thought (CoT) and reinforcement learning (RL) can improve performance. However, applying such reasoning strategies to the visual generation domain remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present T2I-R1, a novel reasoning-enhanced text-to-image generation model, powered by RL with a bi-level CoT reasoning process. Specifically, we identify two levels of CoT that can be utilized to enhance different stages of generation: (1) the semantic-level CoT for high-level planning of the prompt and (2) the token-level CoT for low-level pixel processing during patch-by-patch generation. To better coordinate these two levels of CoT, we introduce BiCoT-GRPO with an ensemble of generation rewards, which seamlessly optimizes both generation CoTs within the same training step. By applying our reasoning strategies to the baseline model, Janus-Pro, we achieve superior performance with 13% improvement on T2I-CompBench and 19% improvement on the WISE benchmark, even surpassing the state-of-the-art model FLUX.1.

| **[Towards Autonomous Micromobility through Scalable Urban Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00690v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules: Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity, realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility. URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents: Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each robot's strengths and limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Highlight.

| **[Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[The Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF): A Unified Approach for Evaluating Software Architectures, Reference Architectures, and Architectural Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00688v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems are guided by hierarchical architectural concepts -- software architectures, reference architectures, and architectural frameworks -- each operating at a distinct level of abstraction. These artifacts promote reuse, scalability, and consistency, but also embed tradeoffs that shape critical quality attributes such as modifiability, performance, and security. Existing evaluation methods, such as the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM), focus on system-specific architectures and are not designed to address the broader generality and variability of higher-level architectural forms. To close this gap, we introduce the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF) -- a unified, scenario-driven framework for evaluating tradeoffs and risks across architectural levels. ATRAF encompasses three methods: the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (ATRAM), extending ATAM with enhanced risk identification for concrete systems; the Reference Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (RATRAM), adapting ATRAM to the evaluation of domain-level reference architectures; and the Architectural Framework Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (AFTRAM), supporting the evaluation of architectural frameworks that guide entire system families. All three methods follow an iterative spiral process that enables the identification of sensitivities, tradeoffs, and risks while supporting continuous refinement of architectural artifacts. We demonstrate ATRAF through progressively abstracted examples derived from the Remote Temperature Sensor (RTS) case, originally introduced in the ATAM literature. ATRAF equips architects, reference modelers, and framework designers with a practical, systematic approach for analyzing design alternatives and managing quality attribute tradeoffs early in the lifecycle and across all levels of architectural abstraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Importance of Gaussianizing Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00685v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The normal distribution plays a central role in information theory - it is at the same time the best-case signal and worst-case noise distribution, has the greatest representational capacity of any distribution, and offers an equivalence between uncorrelatedness and independence for joint distributions. Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved, been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Challenges and Future Directions of Data-Centric AI Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01957v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI systems become increasingly capable and influential, ensuring their alignment with human values, preferences, and goals has become a critical research focus. Current alignment methods primarily focus on designing algorithms and loss functions but often underestimate the crucial role of data. This paper advocates for a shift towards data-centric AI alignment, emphasizing the need to enhance the quality and representativeness of data used in aligning AI systems. In this position paper, we highlight key challenges associated with both human-based and AI-based feedback within the data-centric alignment framework. Through qualitative analysis, we identify multiple sources of unreliability in human feedback, as well as problems related to temporal drift, context dependence, and AI-based feedback failing to capture human values due to inherent model limitations. We propose future research directions, including improved feedback collection practices, robust data-cleaning methodologies, and rigorous feedback verification processes. We call for future research into these critical directions to ensure, addressing gaps that persist in understanding and improving data-centric alignment practices.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05304v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

| **[Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03745v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Artificial Scientific Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11672v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rooted in the explosion of deep learning over the past decade, this thesis spans from AlphaGo to ChatGPT to empirically examine the fundamental concepts needed to realize the vision of an artificial scientist: a machine with the capacity to autonomously generate original research and contribute to the expansion of human knowledge. The investigation begins with Olivaw, an AlphaGo Zero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is unable to communicate it. This realization leads to the development of the Explanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a scientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective EL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a popular board game simulating the scientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an artificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used to explain its findings, and not rely on a rigid existing interpreter. Questioning the very process of learning an interpreter, we turn our attention to the inner functioning of modern multimodal models. This culminates in a simple idea to build CLIP-like models where interpretation and perception are explicitly disentangled: a cost-effective approach that couples two unimodal models using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we discuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial scientists, and introduce the Big-Bench Symbol Interpretation Task, a benchmark about interpreting Zendo-like explanations that sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully solved by humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD t...</summary><p>PhD thesis, 123 pages</p></details> |
| **[DeepCritic: Deliberate Critique with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00662v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving, providing accurate feedback and scalable oversight on their outputs becomes an urgent and critical problem. Leveraging LLMs as critique models to achieve automated supervision is a promising solution. In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math critique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too shallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and struggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct mistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for supervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise critiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth critiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform reinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing human-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained via Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize its critique ability. Our developed critique model built on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct not only significantly outperforms existing LLM critics (including the same-sized DeepSeek-R1-distill models and GPT-4o) on various error identification benchmarks, but also more effectively helps the LLM generator refine erroneous steps through more detailed feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

| **[AI-based CSI Feedback with Digital Twins: Real-World Validation and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00660v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables; this work has been submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Understanding: an Inherent Ambiguity Barrier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00654v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A lively ongoing debate is taking place, since the extraordinary emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with regards to their capability to understand the world and capture the meaning of the dialogues in which they are involved. Arguments and counter-arguments have been proposed based upon thought experiments, anecdotal conversations between LLMs and humans, statistical linguistic analysis, philosophical considerations, and more. In this brief paper we present a counter-argument based upon a thought experiment and semi-formal considerations leading to an inherent ambiguity barrier which prevents LLMs from having any understanding of what their amazingly fluent dialogues mean.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NEURAL COMPUTATION</p></details> |
| **[Open-Source LLM-Driven Federated Transformer for Predictive IoV Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00651v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version; submitted for academic peer review</p></details> |
| **[OmicsCL: Unsupervised Contrastive Learning for Cancer Subtype Discovery and Survival Stratification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00650v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised learning of disease subtypes from multi-omics data presents a significant opportunity for advancing personalized medicine. We introduce OmicsCL, a modular contrastive learning framework that jointly embeds heterogeneous omics modalities-such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression-into a unified latent space. Our method incorporates a survival-aware contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn representations aligned with survival-related patterns, without relying on labeled outcomes. Evaluated on the TCGA BRCA dataset, OmicsCL uncovers clinically meaningful clusters and achieves strong unsupervised concordance with patient survival. The framework demonstrates robustness across hyperparameter configurations and can be tuned to prioritize either subtype coherence or survival stratification. Ablation studies confirm that integrating survival-aware loss significantly enhances the predictive power of learned embeddings. These results highlight the promise of contrastive objectives for biological insight discovery in high-dimensional, heterogeneous omics data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/Atahanka/OmicsCL</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Task Arithmetic for Zero-Shot Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00649v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive zero-shot performance across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, including document re-ranking. However, their effectiveness degrades on unseen tasks and domains, largely due to shifts in vocabulary and word distributions. In this paper, we investigate Task Arithmetic, a technique that combines the weights of LLMs pre-trained on different tasks or domains via simple mathematical operations, such as addition or subtraction, to adapt retrieval models without requiring additional fine-tuning. Our method is able to synthesize diverse tasks and domain knowledge into a single model, enabling effective zero-shot adaptation in different retrieval contexts. Extensive experiments on publicly available scientific, biomedical, and multilingual datasets show that our method improves state-of-the-art re-ranking performance by up to 18% in NDCG@10 and 15% in P@10. In addition to these empirical gains, our analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of Task Arithmetic as a practical strategy for zero-shot learning and model adaptation. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/DetectiveMB/Task-Arithmetic-for-ZS-IR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in SIGIR '25</p></details> |
| **[Robot localization aided by quantum algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00077v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localization is a critical aspect of mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate their environment efficiently and avoid obstacles. Current probabilistic localization methods, such as the Adaptive-Monte Carlo localization (AMCL) algorithm, are computationally intensive and may struggle with large maps or high-resolution sensor data. This paper explores the application of quantum computing in robotics, focusing on the use of Grover's search algorithm to improve the efficiency of localization in mobile robots. We propose a novel approach to utilize Grover's algorithm in a 2D map, enabling faster and more efficient localization. Despite the limitations of current physical quantum computers, our experimental results demonstrate a significant speedup over classical methods, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to improve robotic localization. This work bridges the gap between quantum computing and robotics, providing a practical solution for robotic localization and paving the way for future research in quantum robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 18 figures.

| **[Kernel Ridge Regression for Efficient Learning of High-Capacity Hopfield Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12561v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hopfield networks using Hebbian learning suffer from limited storage capacity. While supervised methods like Linear Logistic Regression (LLR) offer some improvement, kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) significantly enhance capacity and noise robustness. However, KLR requires computationally expensive iterative learning. We propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an efficient kernel-based alternative for learning high-capacity Hopfield networks. KRR utilizes the kernel trick and predicts bipolar states via regression, crucially offering a non-iterative, closed-form solution for learning dual variables. We evaluate KRR and compare its performance against Hebbian, LLR, and KLR. Our results demonstrate that KRR achieves state-of-the-art storage capacity (reaching $\beta$=1.5) and noise robustness, comparable to KLR. Crucially, KRR drastically reduces training time, being orders of magnitude faster than LLR and significantly faster than KLR, especially at higher storage loads. This establishes KRR as a potent and highly efficient method for building high-performance associative memories, providing comparable performance to KLR with substantial training speed advantages. This work provides the first empirical comparison between KRR and KLR in the context of Hopfield network learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

| **[How Real Are Synthetic Therapy Conversations? Evaluating Fidelity in Prolonged Exposure Dialogues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21800v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of synthetic data in healthcare is driven by privacy concerns, limited access to real-world data, and the high cost of annotation. This work explores the use of synthetic Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapeutic conversations for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a scalable alternative for training and evaluating clinical models. We systematically compare real and synthetic dialogues using linguistic, structural, and protocol-specific metrics, including turn-taking patterns and treatment fidelity. We also introduce and evaluate PE-specific metrics derived from linguistic analysis and semantic modeling, offering a novel framework for assessing clinical fidelity beyond surface fluency. Our findings show that although synthetic data holds promise for mitigating data scarcity and protecting patient privacy, it can struggle to capture the subtle dynamics of therapeutic interactions. Synthetic therapy dialogues closely match structural features of real-world conversations (e.g., speaker switch ratio: 0.98 vs. 0.99); however, they may not adequately reflect key fidelity markers (e.g., distress monitoring). We highlight gaps in existing evaluation frameworks and advocate for fidelity-aware metrics that go beyond surface fluency to uncover clinically significant failures. Our findings clarify where synthetic data can effectively complement real-world datasets -- and where critical limitations remain.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 tables |
| **[Conditional Diffusion-Based Retrieval of Atmospheric CO2 from Earth Observing Spectroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17074v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper in "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2025 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning. https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/iclr2025/12</p></details> |

| **[Reward-Augmented Data Enhances Direct Preference Alignment of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08067v4)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly improved their ability to adhere to human instructions and intentions. However, existing direct alignment algorithms primarily focus on relative preferences and often overlook the qualitative aspects of responses, despite having access to preference data that includes reward scores from judge models during AI feedback. Striving to maximize the implicit reward gap between the chosen and the slightly inferior rejected responses can cause overfitting and unnecessary unlearning of the high-quality rejected responses. The unawareness of the reward scores also drives the LLM to indiscriminately favor the low-quality chosen responses and fail to generalize to optimal responses that are sparse in data. To overcome these shortcomings, our study introduces reward-conditioned LLM policies that discern and learn from the entire spectrum of response quality within the dataset, helping extrapolate to more optimal regions. We propose an effective yet simple data relabeling method that conditions the preference pairs on quality scores to construct a reward-augmented dataset. The experiments across various benchmarks and diverse models demonstrate that our approach consistently boosts DPO by a considerable margin. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maximizes the utility of preference data but also mitigates the issue of unlearning, demonstrating its broad effectiveness beyond mere data expansion.

Combining information from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames to produce a high-resolution (HR) image has been explored to overcome the inherent limitations of smartphone cameras. Despite the promise of multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR), current approaches are hindered by datasets that fail to capture the characteristic noise and motion patterns found in real-world handheld burst images. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel synthetic data engine that uses multi-exposure static images to synthesize LR-HR training pairs while preserving sensor-specific noise characteristics and image motion found during handheld burst photography. We also propose MFSR-GAN: a multi-scale RAW-to-RGB network for MFSR. Compared to prior approaches, MFSR-GAN emphasizes a "base frame" throughout its architecture to mitigate artifacts. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrates that MFSR-GAN trained with our synthetic engine yields sharper, more realistic reconstructions than existing methods for real-world MFSR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NTIRE Workshop at CVPR 2025; 8 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

The proposed algorithm consists of three main steps: (i) a specific sparse matrix of size 293x362 (the elimination template) is constructed from the coefficients of the polynomial system describing the platform's kinematics; (ii) the PLU decomposition of this matrix is used to construct a pair of 69x69 matrices; (iii) all 40 solutions (including complex ones) are obtained by computing the generalized eigenvectors of this matrix pair. The proposed algorithm is numerically robust, computationally efficient, and straightforward to implement - requiring only standard linear algebra decompositions. MATLAB, Julia, and Python implementations of the algorithm will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

When a pilot study is available, we recommend sample-based EW D-optimal designs for subsequent experiments. Otherwise, we recommend EW D-optimal designs under a prior distribution for model parameters. We propose an EW ForLion algorithm for finding EW D-optimal designs under a general parametric model, and justify that the designs found by our algorithm are EW D-optimal. To facilitate potential users in practice, we also develop a rounding algorithm that converts an approximate design with mixed factors to an exact design with prespecified grid points and the number of experimental units. By applying our algorithms for real experiments under multinomial logistic models or generalized linear models, we show that our designs are highly efficient with respect to locally D-optimal designs and more robust against parameter value misspecifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 12 tables, and 4 figures</p></details> |

Recent advancements in brain foundation models have shown significant promise in addressing a range of brain-related tasks. However, current brain foundation models are limited by task and data homogeneity, restricted generalization beyond segmentation or classification, and inefficient adaptation to diverse clinical tasks. In this work, we propose SAM-Brain3D, a brain-specific foundation model trained on over 66,000 brain image-label pairs across 14 MRI sub-modalities, and Hypergraph Dynamic Adapter (HyDA), a lightweight adapter for efficient and effective downstream adaptation. SAM-Brain3D captures detailed brain-specific anatomical and modality priors for segmenting diverse brain targets and broader downstream tasks. HyDA leverages hypergraphs to fuse complementary multi-modal data and dynamically generate patient-specific convolutional kernels for multi-scale feature fusion and personalized patient-wise adaptation. Together, our framework excels across a broad spectrum of brain disease segmentation and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, offering a new paradigm for brain disease analysis through multi-modal, multi-scale, and dynamic foundation modeling.</p></details> | 35 pages, 4 figures |

To better address these problems, we introduce an efficient single-loop primal-dual block-coordinate stochastic algorithm called ALEXR. The algorithm employs block-coordinate stochastic mirror ascent with extrapolation for the dual variable and stochastic proximal gradient descent updates for the primal variable. We establish the convergence rates of ALEXR in both convex and strongly convex cases under smoothness and non-smoothness conditions of involved functions, which not only improve the best rates in previous works on smooth cFCCO problems but also expand the realm of cFCCO for solving more challenging non-smooth problems such as the dual form of GDRO. Finally, we derive lower complexity bounds, demonstrating the (near-)optimality of ALEXR within a broad class of stochastic algorithms for cFCCO. Experimental results on GDRO and partial Area Under the ROC Curve (pAUC) maximization demonstrate the promising performance of our algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICML 2025</p></details> |

To this end, we propose Pixel3DMM, a set of highly-generalized vision transformers which predict per-pixel geometric cues in order to constrain the optimization of a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). We exploit the latent features of the DINO foundation model, and introduce a tailored surface normal and uv-coordinate prediction head. We train our model by registering three high-quality 3D face datasets against the FLAME mesh topology, which results in a total of over 1,000 identities and 976K images. For 3D face reconstruction, we propose a FLAME fitting opitmization that solves for the 3DMM parameters from the uv-coordinate and normal estimates. To evaluate our method, we introduce a new benchmark for single-image face reconstruction, which features high diversity facial expressions, viewing angles, and ethnicities. Crucially, our benchmark is the first to evaluate both posed and neutral facial geometry.

Traditional methods for tracking food intake rely on self-reported data before or after the eating, which are prone to inaccuracies. This study proposes an approach to accurately monitor ingest behaviours by leveraging 3D food models constructed from monocular 2D video. Using COLMAP and pose estimation algorithms, we generate detailed 3D representations of food, allowing us to observe changes in food volume as it is consumed. Experiments with toy models and real food items demonstrate the approach's potential. Meanwhile, we have proposed a new methodology for automated state recognition challenges to accurately detect state changes and maintain model fidelity. The 3D reconstruction approach shows promise in capturing comprehensive dietary behaviour insights, ultimately contributing to the development of automated and accurate dietary monitoring tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 CVPR MetaFood Workshop</p></details> |

However, these architectural advancements introduce additional latency during the initial attachment procedure of User Equipment (UE), increasing the risk of signaling storms. This paper investigates the latency impact due to disaggregation of the Base-band Unit (BBU) into the Central Unit (CU) and Distributed Unit (DU). Specifically, we model the delays induced due to disaggregation on UE attachment, analyzing the performance under varying load conditions, and sensitivity to processing times. We demonstrate that while both monolithic and Open RAN architectures experience performance degradation under high-load conditions, Open RAN's added overheads can increase its susceptibility to congestion and signaling storms. However, Open RAN's inherent flexibility, enabled by disaggregation and virtualization, allows efficient deployment of resources, faster service deployment, and adaptive congestion control mechanisms to mitigate these risks and enhance overall system resilience. Thereby, we quantify resilience by introducing a new utility function and propose a novel adaptation mechanism to reinforce Open RAN's robustness against signaling storms. Our results show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly enhances resilience, achieving improvements of up to 286% over fixed configurations, with resilience scores approaching 0.96 under optimal conditions. While simulation results show that Open RAN disaggregation increases attachment latency and susceptibility to signaling congestion, they also highlight that its architectural flexibility can mitigate these effects, improving resilience under high-load conditions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 10 figures |

Unlike Frank-Wolfe or projected gradients, these algorithms avoid optimization over the entire feasible set at each iteration. We prove convergence to stationary points even in a nonconvex setting and we derive accelerated rates for the convex setting both in continuous time, as well as in discrete time. An important property of these algorithms is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities instead of positions, which naturally leads to sparse, local and convex approximations of the feasible set (even if the feasible set is nonconvex). Thus, the complexity tends to grow mildly in the number of decision variables and in the number of constraints, which makes the algorithms suitable for machine learning applications. We apply our algorithms to a compressed sensing and a sparse regression problem, showing that we can treat nonconvex $\ell^p$ constraints ($p<1$) efficiently, while recovering state-of-the-art performance for $p=1$.</p></details> | 44 pages, 6 figures |

Accounting for the mean and variance of activations throughout the layers of deep neural networks has had a significant effect on facilitating their effective training, but seldom has a prescription for precisely what distribution these activations should take, and how this might be achieved, been offered. Motivated by the information-theoretic properties of the normal distribution, we address this question and concurrently present normality normalization: a novel normalization layer which encourages normality in the feature representations of neural networks using the power transform and employs additive Gaussian noise during training. Our experiments comprehensively demonstrate the effectiveness of normality normalization, in regards to its generalization performance on an array of widely used model and dataset combinations, its strong performance across various common factors of variation such as model width, depth, and training minibatch size, its suitability for usage wherever existing normalization layers are conventionally used, and as a means to improving model robustness to random perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Proceedings</p></details> |

Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version; submitted for academic peer review</p></details> |

| **[Interpretability-Aware Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08035v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become prominent models for solving various vision tasks. However, the interpretability of ViTs has not kept pace with their promising performance. While there has been a surge of interest in developing {\it post hoc} solutions to explain ViTs' outputs, these methods do not generalize to different downstream tasks and various transformer architectures. Furthermore, if ViTs are not properly trained with the given data and do not prioritize the region of interest, the {\it post hoc} methods would be less effective. Instead of developing another {\it post hoc} approach, we introduce a novel training procedure that inherently enhances model interpretability. Our interpretability-aware ViT (IA-ViT) draws inspiration from a fresh insight: both the class patch and image patches consistently generate predicted distributions and attention maps. IA-ViT is composed of a feature extractor, a predictor, and an interpreter, which are trained jointly with an interpretability-aware training objective. Consequently, the interpreter simulates the behavior of the predictor and provides a faithful explanation through its single-head self-attention mechanism. Our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IA-ViT in several image classification tasks, with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of model performance and interpretability.

However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT.

| **[Efficient Recommendation with Millions of Items by Dynamic Pruning of Sub-Item Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00560v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large item catalogue is a major challenge for deploying modern sequential recommender models, since it makes the memory footprint of the model large and increases inference latency. One promising approach to address this is RecJPQ, which replaces item embeddings with sub-item embeddings. However, slow inference remains problematic because finding the top highest-scored items usually requires scoring all items in the catalogue, which may not be feasible for large catalogues. By adapting dynamic pruning concepts from document retrieval, we propose the RecJPQPrune dynamic pruning algorithm to efficiently find the top highest-scored items without computing the scores of all items in the catalogue. Our RecJPQPrune algorithm is safe-up-to-rank K since it theoretically guarantees that no potentially high-scored item is excluded from the final top K recommendation list, thereby ensuring no impact on effectiveness. Our experiments on two large datasets and three recommendation models demonstrate the efficiency achievable using RecJPQPrune: for instance, on the Tmall dataset with 2.2M items, we can reduce the median model scoring time by 64 times compared to the Transformer Default baseline, and 5.3 times compared to a recent scoring approach called PQTopK. Overall, this paper demonstrates the effective and efficient inference of Transformer-based recommendation models at catalogue scales not previously reported in the literature. Indeed, our RecJPQPrune algorithm can score 2 million items in under 10 milliseconds without GPUs, and without relying on Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full research paper at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

This study investigates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Rule-Based Information Extraction and Named Entity Recognition (NER), to transform natural language requirements into structured test case specifications. A dataset of 400 feature element documents from the Polarion tool was used to evaluate both approaches for extracting key elements such as signal names and values. The results reveal that the Rule-Based method outperforms the NER method, achieving 95% accuracy for more straightforward requirements with single signals, while the NER method, leveraging SVM and other machine learning algorithms, achieved 77.3% accuracy but struggled with complex scenarios. Statistical analysis confirmed that the Rule-Based approach significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy compared to manual methods. This research highlights the potential of NLP-driven automation in improving quality assurance, reducing manual effort, and expediting test case generation, with future work focused on refining NER and hybrid models to handle greater complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE ICHMS'25</p></details> |
| **[Test-time Correlation Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00533v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks often experience performance drops due to distribution shifts between training and test data. Although domain adaptation offers a solution, privacy concerns restrict access to training data in many real-world scenarios. This restriction has spurred interest in Test-Time Adaptation (TTA), which adapts models using only unlabeled test data. However, current TTA methods still face practical challenges: (1) a primary focus on instance-wise alignment, overlooking CORrelation ALignment (CORAL) due to missing source correlations; (2) complex backpropagation operations for model updating, resulting in overhead computation and (3) domain forgetting. To address these challenges, we provide a theoretical analysis to investigate the feasibility of Test-time Correlation Alignment (TCA), demonstrating that correlation alignment between high-certainty instances and test instances can enhance test performances with a theoretical guarantee. Based on this, we propose two simple yet effective algorithms: LinearTCA and LinearTCA+. LinearTCA applies a simple linear transformation to achieve both instance and correlation alignment without additional model updates, while LinearTCA+ serves as a plug-and-play module that can easily boost existing TTA methods. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical insights and show that TCA methods significantly outperforms baselines across various tasks, benchmarks and backbones. Notably, LinearTCA improves adaptation accuracy by 5.88% on OfficeHome dataset, while using only 4% maximum GPU memory usage and 0.6% computation time compared to the best baseline TTA method.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

We introduce a novel self-ablation mechanism to investigate this connection ante-hoc in the context of language transformers. Our approach dynamically enforces a k-winner-takes-all constraint, forcing the model to demonstrate selective activation across neuron and attention units. Unlike post-hoc methods that analyze already-trained models, our approach integrates interpretability directly into model training, promoting feature localization from inception. Training small models on the TinyStories dataset and employing interpretability tests, we find that self-ablation leads to more localized circuits, concentrated feature representations, and increased neuron specialization without compromising language modelling performance. Surprisingly, our method also decreased overall sparsity, indicating that self-ablation promotes specialization rather than widespread inactivity. This reveals a complex interplay between sparsity and interpretability, where decreased global sparsity can coexist with increased local specialization, leading to enhanced interpretability.

A computational method is valuable for scaling the identification of such statements from a growing body of EU legislation, constituting approximately 180,000 published legal acts between 1952 and 2023. Past work on extraction of these statements varies in the permissiveness of their definitions for what constitutes a regulatory statement. In this work, we provide a specific definition for our purposes based on the institutional grammar tool. We develop and compare two contrasting approaches for automatically identifying such statements in EU legislation, one based on dependency parsing, and the other on a transformer-based machine learning model. We found both approaches performed similarly well with accuracies of 80% and 84% respectively and a K alpha of 0.58. The high accuracies and not exceedingly high agreement suggests potential for combining strengths of both approaches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[On phase in scaled graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21448v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaled graph has been introduced recently as a nonlinear extension of the classical Nyquist plot for linear time-invariant systems. In this paper, we introduce a modified definition for the scaled graph, termed the signed scaled graph (SSG), in which the phase component is characterized by making use of the Hilbert transform. Whereas the original definition of the scaled graph uses unsigned phase angles, the new definition has signed phase angles which ensures the possibility to differentiate between phase-lead and phase-lag properties in a system. Making such distinction is important from both an analysis and a synthesis perspective, and helps in providing tighter stability estimates of feedback interconnections. We show how the proposed SSG leads to intuitive characterizations of positive real and negative imaginary nonlinear systems, and present various interconnection results. We showcase the effectiveness of our results through several motivating examples.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[On estimating the quantum $\ell_α$ distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00457v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the computational complexity of estimating the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$, defined via the Schatten $\alpha$-norm $\|A\|_{\alpha} = \mathrm{tr}(|A|^{\alpha})^{1/\alpha}$, given $\operatorname{poly}(n)$-size state-preparation circuits of $n$-qubit quantum states $\rho_0$ and $\rho_1$. This quantity serves as a lower bound on the trace distance for $\alpha > 1$. For any constant $\alpha > 1$, we develop an efficient rank-independent quantum estimator for ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ with time complexity $\operatorname{poly}(n)$, achieving an exponential speedup over the prior best results of $\exp(n)$ due to Wang, Guan, Liu, Zhang, and Ying (TIT 2024). Our improvement leverages efficiently computable uniform polynomial approximations of signed positive power functions within quantum singular value transformation, thereby eliminating the dependence on the rank of the quantum states. Our quantum algorithm reveals a dichotomy in the computational complexity of the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem with Schatten $\alpha$-norm (QSD$_{\alpha}$), which involves deciding whether ${\mathrm{T}_\alpha}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ is at least $2/5$ or at most $1/5$. This dichotomy arises between the cases of constant $\alpha > 1$ and $\alpha=1$: - For any $1+\Omega(1) \leq \alpha \leq O(1)$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{BQP}$-complete. - For any $1 \leq \alpha \leq 1+\frac{1}{n}$, QSD$_{\alpha}$ is $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete, implying that no efficient quantum estimator for $\mathrm{T}_\alpha(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ exists unless $\mathsf{BQP} = \mathsf{QSZK}$. The hardness results follow from reductions based on new rank-dependent inequalities for the quantum $\ell_{\alpha}$ distance with $1\leq \alpha \leq \infty$, which are of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks. This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Pretrained Diffusion Models for Zero-Shot Part Assembly](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00426v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D part assembly aims to understand part relationships and predict their 6-DoF poses to construct realistic 3D shapes, addressing the growing demand for autonomous assembly, which is crucial for robots. Existing methods mainly estimate the transformation of each part by training neural networks under supervision, which requires a substantial quantity of manually labeled data. However, the high cost of data collection and the immense variability of real-world shapes and parts make traditional methods impractical for large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose first a zero-shot part assembly method that utilizes pre-trained point cloud diffusion models as discriminators in the assembly process, guiding the manipulation of parts to form realistic shapes. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that utilizing a diffusion model for zero-shot part assembly can be transformed into an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process. Then, we propose a novel pushing-away strategy to address the overlap parts, thereby further enhancing the robustness of the method. To verify our work, we conduct extensive experiments and quantitative comparisons to several strong baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which even surpasses the supervised learning method. The code has been released on https://github.com/Ruiyuan-Zhang/Zero-Shot-Assembly.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 12 figures, Accepted by IJCAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[Network-aided Efficient LLM Services With Denoising-inspired Prompt Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03621v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, leading to their increasing adoption in diverse services delivered through wireless networks. There is a growing trend toward longer prompts to better leverage LLMs' capabilities and address difficult tasks. However, longer prompts not only increase data transmission costs but also require more computing resources and processing time, which impacts overall system efficiency and user experience. To address this challenge, we propose Joint Power and Prompt Optimization (JPPO), a framework that combines Small Language Model (SLM)-based prompt compression with wireless power allocation optimization. By deploying SLM at edge devices for prompt compression and employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for joint optimization of compression ratio and transmission power, JPPO effectively balances service quality with resource efficiency. Furthermore, inspired by denoising diffusion models, we design a denoising-inspired prompt compression approach that iteratively compresses prompts by gradually removing non-critical information, further enhancing the framework's performance. Experimental results with long prompt tokens demonstrate that our framework achieves high service fidelity while optimizing power usage in wireless LLM services, significantly reducing the total service response time. With our DRL-based JPPO, the framework maintains fidelity comparable to the no-compression baseline while still achieving a 17% service time reduction through adaptive compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.18010</p></details> |
| **[Latte: Latent Diffusion Transformer for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03048v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Latte, a novel Latent Diffusion Transformer for video generation. Latte first extracts spatio-temporal tokens from input videos and then adopts a series of Transformer blocks to model video distribution in the latent space. In order to model a substantial number of tokens extracted from videos, four efficient variants are introduced from the perspective of decomposing the spatial and temporal dimensions of input videos. To improve the quality of generated videos, we determine the best practices of Latte through rigorous experimental analysis, including video clip patch embedding, model variants, timestep-class information injection, temporal positional embedding, and learning strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance across four standard video generation datasets, i.e., FaceForensics, SkyTimelapse, UCF101, and Taichi-HD. In addition, we extend Latte to the text-to-video generation (T2V) task, where Latte achieves results that are competitive with recent T2V models. We strongly believe that Latte provides valuable insights for future research on incorporating Transformers into diffusion models for video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Transactions on Machine Learning Research 2025; Project Page: https://maxin-cn.github.io/latte_project</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Estimate Package Delivery Time in Mixed Imbalanced Delivery and Pickup Logistics Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00375v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating package delivery time is essential to the logistics industry, which enables reasonable work allocation and on-time service guarantee. This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers' spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior, but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT, a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in Beijing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024</p></details> |
| **[From GNNs to Trees: Multi-Granular Interpretability for Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00364v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability, they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g., relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids, and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a graph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees) into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Deep Neural Networks using Safety-Guided Self Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00350v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices necessitates effective model com- pression strategies that judiciously balance the reduction of model size with the preservation of performance. This study introduces a novel safety-driven quantization framework that leverages preservation sets to systematically prune and quantize neural network weights, thereby optimizing model complexity without compromising accuracy. The proposed methodology is rigorously evaluated on both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and an attention-based language model, demonstrating its applicability across diverse architectural paradigms. Experimental results reveal that our framework achieves up to a 2.5% enhancement in test accuracy relative to the original unquantized models while maintaining 60% of the initial model size. In comparison to conventional quantization techniques, our approach not only augments generalization by eliminating parameter noise and retaining essential weights but also reduces variance, thereby ensuring the retention of critical model features. These findings underscore the efficacy of safety-driven quantization as a robust and reliable strategy for the efficient optimization of deep learn- ing models. The implementation and comprehensive experimental evaluations of our framework are publicly accessible at GitHub.</p></details> | A Preprint |

However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings necessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical implications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from four related studies to propose a comprehensive framework for enhancing AI-driven educational tools. We integrate cognitive assessment frameworks (Bloom's Taxonomy and SOLO Taxonomy), linguistic analysis of AI-generated feedback, and ethical design principles to guide the development of effective and responsible AI tools. We outline a structured three-phase approach encompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical safeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through its integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz generation. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for educators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while upholding pedagogical and ethical standards in educational content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article will be presented in IJCNN 2025 "AI Innovations for Education: Transforming Teaching and Learning through Cutting-Edge Technologies" workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Neural Video Representation with Temporally Coherent Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00335v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications across diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information, NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters) and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic), compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks, we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264, HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm across diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and video inpainting.

The ability to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs is crucial for enhancing downstream tasks such as object detection and segmentation. While deep learning has significantly advanced SR, achieving high-quality reconstructions with fine-grained details and realistic textures remains challenging, particularly at high upscaling factors. Recent approaches leveraging diffusion models have demonstrated promising results, yet they often struggle to balance perceptual quality with structural fidelity. In this work, we introduce ResQu a novel SR framework that integrates a quaternion wavelet preprocessing framework with latent diffusion models, incorporating a new quaternion wavelet- and time-aware encoder. Unlike prior methods that simply apply wavelet transforms within diffusion models, our approach enhances the conditioning process by exploiting quaternion wavelet embeddings, which are dynamically integrated at different stages of denoising. Furthermore, we also leverage the generative priors of foundation models such as Stable Diffusion. Extensive experiments on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding SR results, outperforming in many cases existing approaches in perceptual quality and standard evaluation metrics. The code will be available after the revision process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

Despite their effectiveness, recent studies reveal that self-attention mechanism used in current Transformer-based sequential recommendation models is constantly a low-pass filter which results in several problems. These problems include being incompetent in learning evolving user patterns and capturing users' abrupt interests. To integrate low and high frequency information effectively and overcome these problems, we propose a novel Wavelet enhanced hybrid attention network called DWTRec for sequential recommendation. Due to excellent characteristics of Wavelet Transform in signal processing, we can perform fine-grained signals decomposition while removing noise and capturing trending signals behind non-stationary sequences of user-item interactions. To address the bound distortion problem of the reconstructed signal of Discrete Wavelet Transform, we design a learning algorithm which adapts to different datasets. Our findings suggest a promising approach to improve the modeling power of self-attention. We tested our method on six datasets with different domains, different sparsity levels, and different average sequence lengths. Experiments show that our method outperforms all eight baseline models in recommendation performance on all datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>17pag...</summary><p>17pages, accepted by ICIC 2025 oral</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Vector Compressed Sensing Using James Stein Shrinkage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00326v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense, and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust, delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.</p></details> | 69 pages |

After traditional statistical and machine learning approaches, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can outperform Transformers. These findings have opened up new possibilities for using diverse architectures, ranging from fundamental deep learning models to emerging architectures and hybrid approaches. In this context, architectural modeling of time series forecasting has now entered a renaissance. This survey not only provides a historical context for time series forecasting but also offers comprehensive and timely analysis of the movement toward architectural diversification. By comparing and re-examining deep learning models, we uncover new perspectives and present recent trends, including hybrid, diffusion, Mamba, and foundation models. By focusing on the inherent characteristics of time series data, we also address open challenges that have gained attention in time series forecasting, such as channel dependency, distribution shift, causality, and feature extraction. These contributions help lower entry barriers for newcomers by providing a systematic understanding of the diverse research areas in time series forecasting (TSF), while offering seasoned researchers broader perspectives and new opportunities through in-depth exploration of TSF challenges.

| **[Folded Context Condensation in Path Integral Formalism for Infinite Context Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04620v5)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a generalized formulation of the Transformer algorithm by reinterpreting its core mechanisms within the framework of Path Integral formalism. In this perspective, the attention mechanism is recast as a process that integrates all possible transition paths leading to future token states, with temporal evolution governed by the Feed-Forward Network. By systematically mapping each component of the Transformer to its counterpart in the Path Integral formulation, we obtain a more compact and efficient representation, in which the contextual information of a sequence is condensed into memory-like segments. These segments are recurrently processed across Transformer layers, enabling more effective long-term information retention. We validate the effectiveness of this approach through the Passkey retrieval task and a summarization task, demonstrating that the proposed method preserves historical information while exhibiting memory usage that scales linearly with sequence length. This contrasts with the non-linear memory growth typically observed in standard attention mechanisms. We expect that this quantum-inspired generalization of the Transformer architecture will open new avenues for enhancing both the efficiency and expressiveness of future Transformer models.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

However, existing systems are often constrained to specific, predefined tasks, limiting their adaptability in open-ended analytical scenarios. The recent emergence of Video-Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively, significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Here I present a proof that a chemputer endowed with a finite, but extensible reagent, catalyst, process condition sets, and a chempiler that maps reaction graphs to hardware graphs, and dynamic error correction handles, is universal for the synthesis of any stable, isolable molecule that respects conservation of matter and finite reaction time and can be produced in detectable amounts. In developing this proof, I also expanded the internationally accepted definition of a molecule, by requiring that the molecule must be reachable in an analytically accessible amount using concepts from assembly theory. This shows that error correction is a vital requirement for chemputation, and I formalise the universal chemical synthesis theorem, demonstrate a full worked example, and explore the practical limits imposed by vessel count and sensing bandwidth. In doing so, I show that chemical reactions are not implicit blackbox functions but emergent graph operations or chemical transformations over Reagents (R) x Process (P) x Catalyst (K). The role of universally configurable hardware is also highlighted, with the introduction of a chempiling function that translates synthesis pathways into executable hardware configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 35 references</p></details> |
| **[Generalizing Safety Beyond Collision-Avoidance via Latent-Space Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00935v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a rigorous mathematical framework that enables robots to simultaneously detect unsafe states and generate actions that prevent future failures. While in theory, HJ reachability can synthesize safe controllers for nonlinear systems and nonconvex constraints, in practice, it has been limited to hand-engineered collision-avoidance constraints modeled via low-dimensional state-space representations and first-principles dynamics. In this work, our goal is to generalize safe robot controllers to prevent failures that are hard--if not impossible--to write down by hand, but can be intuitively identified from high-dimensional observations: for example, spilling the contents of a bag. We propose Latent Safety Filters, a latent-space generalization of HJ reachability that tractably operates directly on raw observation data (e.g., RGB images) to automatically compute safety-preserving actions without explicit recovery demonstrations by performing safety analysis in the latent embedding space of a generative world model. Our method leverages diverse robot observation-action data of varying quality (including successes, random exploration, and unsafe demonstrations) to learn a world model. Constraint specification is then transformed into a classification problem in the latent space of the learned world model. In simulation and hardware experiments, we compute an approximation of Latent Safety Filters to safeguard arbitrary policies (from imitation- learned policies to direct teleoperation) from complex safety hazards, like preventing a Franka Research 3 manipulator from spilling the contents of a bag or toppling cluttered objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, 7 tables, RSS 2025</p></details> |

| **[Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05304v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models approximate the denoising distribution as a Gaussian and predict its mean, whereas flow matching models reparameterize the Gaussian mean as flow velocity. However, they underperform in few-step sampling due to discretization error and tend to produce over-saturated colors under classifier-free guidance (CFG). To address these limitations, we propose a novel Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model: instead of predicting the mean, GMFlow predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture (GM) parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, which can be learned with a KL divergence loss. We demonstrate that GMFlow generalizes previous diffusion and flow matching models where a single Gaussian is learned with an $L_2$ denoising loss. For inference, we derive GM-SDE/ODE solvers that leverage analytic denoising distributions and velocity fields for precise few-step sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel probabilistic guidance scheme that mitigates the over-saturation issues of CFG and improves image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFlow consistently outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, achieving a Precision of 0.942 with only 6 sampling steps on ImageNet 256$\times$256.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025.

Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version; submitted for academic peer review</p></details> |

Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a workshop paper in "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning", ICLR 2025 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning. https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/iclr2025/12</p></details> |
| **[SOMA: a novel sampler for exchangeable variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00635v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of sampling exchangeable random variables arises in many Bayesian inference tasks, especially in data imputation given a privatized summary statistics. These permutation-invariant joint distributions often have dependency structures that make sampling challenging. Component-wise sampling strategies, such as Metropolis-within-Gibbs, can mix slowly because they consider only comparing a proposed point with one component at a time. In this work, we propose a novel Single-Offer-Multiple-Attempts (SOMA) sampler that is tailored to sampling permutation invariant distributions. The core intuition of SOMA is that a proposed point unsuitable to replace one component might still be a good candidate to replace some other component in the joint distribution. SOMA first makes a singer offer, and then simultaneously considers attempts to replace each component of the current state with the single offer, before making the final acceptance or rejection decision. We provide an acceptance lower bound of SOMA and, using a coupling method, derive the convergence rate upper bound of SOMA in the two-dimensional case. We validate theoretical findings with numerical simulations, including a demonstration on differentially private Bayesian linear regression.</p></details> | 30 pages, 13 figures |

Unlike existing GFM benchmarks, GERM offers the first comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the vulnerability of GFMs to adversarial attacks. Methodologically, we evaluate the adversarial robustness of five state-of-the-art GFMs using four widely adopted attack algorithms and three defense strategies. Importantly, our benchmark provides an accessible and comprehensive framework to analyze GFM vulnerabilities with respect to model architecture, quantization schemes, and training datasets. Empirically, transformer-based models exhibit greater robustness to adversarial perturbations compared to HyenaDNA, highlighting the impact of architectural design on vulnerability. Moreover, adversarial attacks frequently target biologically significant genomic regions, suggesting that these models effectively capture meaningful sequence features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025</p></details> |

However, their huge computation and storage complexity make these models difficult to fine-tune and also less applicable in practice. Recent study shows training in Fourier domain can be an effective fine-tuning method in terms of both model performance and number of training parameters. In this work, we propose to further reduce the complexity by the factorization through the product of interleaved circulant and diagonal matrices. In addition, we address the case of non-square fine-tuning weights by partitioning the circulant matrix into blocks. Our method avoids the construction of weight change matrix and utilizes 1D fast Fourier transform (FFT) instead of 2D FFT. Experimental results show that our method achieves similar or better performance across various tasks with much less floating-point operations (FLOPs) and the number of trainable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in Proceedings of the 2025 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-2025)</p></details> |

Although ML is strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body: 29 pages, 7 figures; Supplementary material: 39 pages, 14 figures</p></details> |

Given $\varepsilon > 0$, our algorithms achieve relative $\ell^1$ - $\ell^\infty$ accuracy $\varepsilon$ in time $O(N^3 (\log N)^2 + N^3 |\log \varepsilon|^2)$, while the na\"{i}ve direct application of the expansion operators has time complexity $O(N^6)$.

| **[TeLoGraF: Temporal Logic Planning via Graph-encoded Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00562v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to solve complex tasks with signal temporal logic (STL) specifications is crucial to many real-world applications. However, most previous works only consider fixed or parametrized STL specifications due to the lack of a diverse STL dataset and encoders to effectively extract temporal logic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose TeLoGraF, Temporal Logic Graph-encoded Flow, which utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) encoder and flow-matching to learn solutions for general STL specifications. We identify four commonly used STL templates and collect a total of 200K specifications with paired demonstrations. We conduct extensive experiments in five simulation environments ranging from simple dynamical models in the 2D space to high-dimensional 7DoF Franka Panda robot arm and Ant quadruped navigation. Results show that our method outperforms other baselines in the STL satisfaction rate. Compared to classical STL planning algorithms, our approach is 10-100X faster in inference and can work on any system dynamics. Besides, we show our graph-encoding method's capability to solve complex STLs and robustness to out-distribution STL specifications.

| **[Efficient Recommendation with Millions of Items by Dynamic Pruning of Sub-Item Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00560v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A large item catalogue is a major challenge for deploying modern sequential recommender models, since it makes the memory footprint of the model large and increases inference latency. One promising approach to address this is RecJPQ, which replaces item embeddings with sub-item embeddings. However, slow inference remains problematic because finding the top highest-scored items usually requires scoring all items in the catalogue, which may not be feasible for large catalogues. By adapting dynamic pruning concepts from document retrieval, we propose the RecJPQPrune dynamic pruning algorithm to efficiently find the top highest-scored items without computing the scores of all items in the catalogue. Our RecJPQPrune algorithm is safe-up-to-rank K since it theoretically guarantees that no potentially high-scored item is excluded from the final top K recommendation list, thereby ensuring no impact on effectiveness. Our experiments on two large datasets and three recommendation models demonstrate the efficiency achievable using RecJPQPrune: for instance, on the Tmall dataset with 2.2M items, we can reduce the median model scoring time by 64 times compared to the Transformer Default baseline, and 5.3 times compared to a recent scoring approach called PQTopK. Overall, this paper demonstrates the effective and efficient inference of Transformer-based recommendation models at catalogue scales not previously reported in the literature. Indeed, our RecJPQPrune algorithm can score 2 million items in under 10 milliseconds without GPUs, and without relying on Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full research paper at SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph Spectral Filtering with Chebyshev Interpolation for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00552v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks in two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent space with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially valuable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is limited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a fine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these limitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum and a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a CF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding, it takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of signals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively approximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by using an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through extensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned bottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGIR 2025; 11 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Student Distraction Through Fuzzy Logic Based Seating Arrangements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00545v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial skill for primary school teachers is maintaining efficient classroom management. Teachers use classroom seating arrangements to help maintain this efficiency. However, developing classroom seating arrangements is both time-consuming and often non-optimal for distraction mitigation. Fuzzy logic-based approaches for the development of classroom seating arrangements can reduce development time and minimize classroom distraction. In this study, an original fuzzy logic-based software package named "CUB" is introduced and applied to a modern classroom using "cluster" seating arrangements. The combination of fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy c-means clustering, sequential, and iterative processes produce ready-to-use seating arrangements for the classroom in this study. The seating arrangements are compared with an existing set of seating arrangements to validate the results. The author's findings show that CUB is successful in generating applicable seating arrangements with a small liklihood of replicating arrangements. The findings also suggest that fuzz logic-based approaches may be successful in other styles of classroom arrangement.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Distilling Calibration via Conformalized Credal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06066v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying artificial intelligence (AI) models on edge devices involves a delicate balance between meeting stringent complexity constraints, such as limited memory and energy resources, and ensuring reliable performance in sensitive decision-making tasks. One way to enhance reliability is through uncertainty quantification via Bayesian inference. This approach, however, typically necessitates maintaining and running multiple models in an ensemble, which may exceed the computational limits of edge devices. This paper introduces a low-complexity methodology to address this challenge by distilling calibration information from a more complex model. In an offline phase, predictive probabilities generated by a high-complexity cloud-based model are leveraged to determine a threshold based on the typical divergence between the cloud and edge models. At run time, this threshold is used to construct credal sets -- ranges of predictive probabilities that are guaranteed, with a user-selected confidence level, to include the predictions of the cloud model. The credal sets are obtained through thresholding of a divergence measure in the simplex of predictive probabilities. Experiments on visual and language tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach, termed Conformalized Distillation for Credal Inference (CD-CI), significantly improves calibration performance compared to low-complexity Bayesian methods, such as Laplace approximation, making it a practical and efficient solution for edge AI deployments.</p></details> | Under review |

While the existing classifier framework characterises cases solely through the facts involved, legal reasoning fundamentally relies on both facts and rules, particularly the ratio decidendi. This paper presents an initial approach to incorporating sets of rules within a classifier. Our work is built on the work of Canavotto et al. (2023), which has developed the rule-based reason model of precedential constraint within a hierarchy of factors. We demonstrate how decisions for new cases can be inferred using this enriched rule-based classifier framework. Additionally, we provide an example of how the time element and the hierarchy of courts can be used in the new classifier framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure.

To automate this process, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for discrete prompt optimization, called EvoPrompt, which borrows the idea of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) as they exhibit good performance and fast convergence. To enable EAs to work on discrete prompts, which are natural language expressions that need to be coherent and human-readable, we connect LLMs with EAs. This approach allows us to simultaneously leverage the powerful language processing capabilities of LLMs and the efficient optimization performance of EAs. Specifically, abstaining from any gradients or parameters, EvoPrompt starts from a population of prompts and iteratively generates new prompts with LLMs based on the evolutionary operators, improving the population based on the development set. We optimize prompts for both closed- and open-source LLMs including GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, on 31 datasets covering language understanding, generation tasks, as well as BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) tasks. EvoPrompt significantly outperforms human-engineered prompts and existing methods for automatic prompt generation (e.g., up to 25% on BBH). Furthermore, EvoPrompt demonstrates that connecting LLMs with EAs creates synergies, which could inspire further research on the combination of LLMs and conventional algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2024</p></details> |

In problems of Bayesian inference, one models this unknown distribution as a random measure, and the law of this random measure is the prior. When $S = \{0, 1\}$, a commonly used prior is the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$, or more generally, the beta distribution. When $S$ is finite, the analogous choice is the Dirichlet distribution. For a general space $S$, we are led naturally to the Dirichlet process (see [Ferguson, 1973]). Here, we consider an array of random variables, and in so doing are led to what we call the iterated Dirichlet process (IDP). We define the IDP and then show how to compute the posterior distribution, given a finite set of observations, using the method of sequential imputation. Ordinarily, this method requires the existence of certain joint density functions, which the IDP lacks. We therefore present a new, more general proof of the validity of sequential imputation, and show that the hypotheses of our proof are satisfied by the IDP.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometric consistency.Experiments show that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

| **[Can Differentially Private Fine-tuning LLMs Protect Against Privacy Attacks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21036v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has become an essential strategy for adapting them to specialized tasks; however, this process introduces significant privacy challenges, as sensitive training data may be inadvertently memorized and exposed. Although differential privacy (DP) offers strong theoretical guarantees against such leakage, its empirical privacy effectiveness on LLMs remains unclear, especially under different fine-tuning methods. In this paper, we systematically investigate the impact of DP across fine-tuning methods and privacy budgets, using both data extraction and membership inference attacks to assess empirical privacy risks. Our main findings are as follows: (1) Differential privacy reduces model utility, but its impact varies significantly across different fine-tuning methods. (2) Without DP, the privacy risks of models fine-tuned with different approaches differ considerably. (3) When DP is applied, even a relatively high privacy budget can substantially lower privacy risk. (4) The privacy-utility trade-off under DP training differs greatly among fine-tuning methods, with some methods being unsuitable for DP due to severe utility degradation. Our results provide practical guidance for privacy-conscious deployment of LLMs and pave the way for future research on optimizing the privacy-utility trade-off in fine-tuning methodologies.</p></details> | accepted by DBSec25 |

The core idea is to imitate fully connected (FC) neural network layers using multiple MIMO channels by carefully designing the precoding matrices at the transmitting nodes. A neural network dubbed PrototypeNet is employed consisting of multiple FC layers, with the number of neurons of each layer equal to the number of antennas of the corresponding terminal. To achieve satisfactory performance, we train PrototypeNet based on a customized loss function consisting of classification error and the power of latent vectors to satisfy transmit power constraints, with noise injection during training. Precoding matrices for each hop are then obtained by solving an optimization problem. We also propose a multiple-block extension when the number of antennas is limited. Numerical results verify that the proposed over-the-air transmission scheme can achieve satisfactory classification accuracy under a power constraint. The results also show that higher classification accuracy can be achieved with an increasing number of hops at a modest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, due to the huge model sizes, running them in resource-constrained environments where the GPU memory is not abundant is challenging. Some existing systems propose to use CPU resources to solve that, but they either suffer from the significant overhead of frequently moving data between CPU and GPU, or fail to consider distinct characteristics of CPUs and GPUs. This paper proposes Fiddler, a resource-efficient inference system for MoE models with limited GPU resources. Fiddler strategically utilizes CPU and GPU resources by determining the optimal execution strategy. Our evaluation shows that, unlike state-of-the-art systems that optimize for specific scenarios such as single batch inference or long prefill, Fiddler performs better in all scenarios. Compared against different baselines, Fiddler achieves 1.26 times speed up in single batch inference, 1.30 times in long prefill processing, and 11.57 times in beam search inference.

Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |

In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrate that inference-time activation interventions can bypass safety alignments and effectively steer model generations towards harmful AI coordination for Llama 2. Our method applies fine-grained interventions at specific model subcomponents, particularly attention heads, using a simple binary choice probing strategy. These interventions then generalise to the open-ended generation setting effectively circumventing safety guardrails. We show that probing single attention heads is more effective than intervening on full layers and intervening on only four attention heads is comparable to supervised fine-tuning. We further show that only a few example completions are needed to compute effective steering directions, which is an advantage over classical fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the shortcomings of current alignment techniques. In addition, our results suggest that, at the attention head level, activations encode fine-grained linearly separable behaviors. Practically, the approach offers a straightforward methodology to steer large language model behaviour, which could be extended to diverse domains beyond safety requiring fine-grained control over the model output. The code and datasets for this study can be found on https://github.com/PaulDrm/targeted_intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>Large...</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), Interference-time activation shifting, Steerability, Explainability, AI alignment, Interpretability</p></details> |

While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications.

| **[TransparentGS: Fast Inverse Rendering of Transparent Objects with Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18768v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of neural and Gaussian-based radiance field methods has led to considerable advancements in novel view synthesis and 3D object reconstruction. Nonetheless, specular reflection and refraction continue to pose significant challenges due to the instability and incorrect overfitting of radiance fields to high-frequency light variations. Currently, even 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by SIGGRAPH 2025; https://letianhuang.github.io/transparentgs/</p></details> |
| **[Geodesic Synthetic Control Methods for Random Objects and Functional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00331v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a geodesic synthetic control method for causal inference that extends existing synthetic control methods to scenarios where outcomes are elements in a geodesic metric space rather than scalars. Examples of such outcomes include distributions, compositions, networks, trees and functional data, among other data types that can be viewed as elements of a geodesic metric space given a suitable metric. We extend this further to geodesic synthetic difference-in-differences that builds on the established synthetic difference-in-differences for Euclidean outcomes. This estimator generalizes both the geodesic synthetic control method and a previously proposed geodesic difference-in-differences method and exhibits a double robustness property. The proposed geodesic synthetic control method is illustrated through comprehensive simulation studies and applications to the employment composition changes following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, and the impact of abortion liberalization policy on fertility patterns in East Germany. We illustrate the proposed geodesic synthetic difference-in-differences by studying the consequences of the Soviet Union's collapse on age-at-death distributions for males and females.</p></details> | 36 pages, 10 figures |
| **[FedEMA: Federated Exponential Moving Averaging with Negative Entropy Regularizer in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00318v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street Scene Semantic Understanding (denoted as S3U) is a crucial but complex task for autonomous driving (AD) vehicles. Their inference models typically face poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models through privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models face significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically evolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of historical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average (FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral innovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation via fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL round's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative entropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to EMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a dual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and adaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the proposed FedEMA. Extensive experiments both on Cityscapes dataset and Camvid dataset demonstrate FedEMA's superiority over existing approaches, showing 7.12% higher mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Non-Myopic Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08085v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of finite-horizon sequential experimental design to solve multi-objective optimization (MOO) of expensive black-box objective functions. This problem arises in many real-world applications, including materials design, where we have a small resource budget to make and evaluate candidate materials in the lab. We solve this problem using the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and propose the first set of non-myopic methods for MOO problems. Prior work on non-myopic BO for single-objective problems relies on the Bellman optimality principle to handle the lookahead reasoning process. However, this principle does not hold for most MOO problems because the reward function needs to satisfy some conditions: scalar variable, monotonicity, and additivity. We address this challenge by using hypervolume improvement (HVI) as our scalarization approach, which allows us to use a lower-bound on the Bellman equation to approximate the finite-horizon using a batch expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) acquisition function (AF) for MOO. Our formulation naturally allows us to use other improvement-based scalarizations and compare their efficacy to HVI. We derive three non-myopic AFs for MOBO: 1) the Nested AF, which is based on the exact computation of the lower bound, 2) the Joint AF, which is a lower bound on the nested AF, and 3) the BINOM AF, which is a fast and approximate variant based on batch multi-objective acquisition functions. Our experiments on multiple diverse real-world MO problems demonstrate that our non-myopic AFs substantially improve performance over the existing myopic AFs for MOBO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |
| **[Evaluation and Verification of Physics-Informed Neural Models of the Grad-Shafranov Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21155v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our contributions are motivated by fusion reactors that rely on maintaining magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium, where the balance between plasma pressure and confining magnetic fields is required for stable operation. In axisymmetric tokamak reactors in particular, and under the assumption of toroidal symmetry, this equilibrium can be mathematically modelled using the Grad-Shafranov Equation (GSE). Recent works have demonstrated the potential of using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model the GSE. Existing studies did not examine realistic scenarios in which a single network generalizes to a variety of boundary conditions. Addressing that limitation, we evaluate a PINN architecture that incorporates boundary points as network inputs. Additionally, we compare PINN model accuracy and inference speeds with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model. Finding the PINN model to be the most performant, and accurate in our setting, we use the network verification tool Marabou to perform a range of verification tasks. Although we find some discrepancies between evaluations of the networks natively in PyTorch, compared to via Marabou, we are able to demonstrate useful and practical verification workflows. Our study is the first investigation of verification of such networks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

A clear separation of private information from the LLM training has made RAG the basis for many enterprise LLM workloads as it allows the company to augment LLM's understanding using customers' private documents. Despite its popularity for private documents in enterprise deployments, current RAG benchmarks for validating and optimizing RAG pipelines draw their corpora from public data such as Wikipedia or generic web pages and offer little to no personal context. Seeking to empower more personal and private RAG we release the EnronQA benchmark, a dataset of 103,638 emails with 528,304 question-answer pairs across 150 different user inboxes. EnronQA enables better benchmarking of RAG pipelines over private data and allows for experimentation on the introduction of personalized retrieval settings over realistic data. Finally, we use EnronQA to explore the tradeoff in memorization and retrieval when reasoning over private documents.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents ReasoningV, a novel model employing a hybrid reasoning strategy that integrates trained intrinsic capabilities with dynamic inference adaptation for Verilog code generation. Our framework introduces three complementary innovations: (1) ReasoningV-5K, a high-quality dataset of 5,000 functionally verified instances with reasoning paths created through multi-dimensional filtering of PyraNet samples; (2) a two-stage training approach combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundational knowledge with full-parameter optimization for enhanced reasoning; and (3) an adaptive reasoning mechanism that dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on problem complexity, reducing token consumption by up to 75\% while preserving performance. Experimental results demonstrate ReasoningV's effectiveness with a pass@1 accuracy of 57.8\% on VerilogEval-human, achieving performance competitive with leading commercial models like Gemini-2.0-flash (59.5\%) and exceeding the previous best open-source model by 10.4 percentage points.

| **[QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04532v3)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization can accelerate large language model (LLM) inference. Going beyond INT8 quantization, the research community is actively exploring even lower precision, such as INT4. Nonetheless, state-of-the-art INT4 quantization techniques only accelerate low-batch, edge LLM inference, failing to deliver performance gains in large-batch, cloud-based LLM serving. We uncover a critical issue: existing INT4 quantization methods suffer from significant runtime overhead (20-90%) when dequantizing either weights or partial sums on GPUs. To address this challenge, we introduce QoQ, a W4A8KV4 quantization algorithm with 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache. QoQ stands for quattuor-octo-quattuor, which represents 4-8-4 in Latin. QoQ is implemented by the QServe inference library that achieves measured speedup. The key insight driving QServe is that the efficiency of LLM serving on GPUs is critically influenced by operations on low-throughput CUDA cores. Building upon this insight, in QoQ algorithm, we introduce progressive quantization that can allow low dequantization overhead in W4A8 GEMM. Additionally, we develop SmoothAttention to effectively mitigate the accuracy degradation incurred by 4-bit KV quantization. In the QServe system, we perform compute-aware weight reordering and take advantage of register-level parallelism to reduce dequantization latency. We also make fused attention memory-bound, harnessing the performance gain brought by KV4 quantization. As a result, QServe improves the maximum achievable serving throughput of Llama-3-8B by 1.2x on A100, 1.4x on L40S; and Qwen1.5-72B by 2.4x on A100, 3.5x on L40S, compared to TensorRT-LLM. Remarkably, QServe on L40S GPU can achieve even higher throughput than TensorRT-LLM on A100. Thus, QServe effectively reduces the dollar cost of LLM serving by 3x.

In general cases, existing text-to-image generation models excel in producing high-quality images; however, they struggle to capture diverse characteristics and faithful details of specific domains, particularly Chinese dishes. To address this limitation, we propose Omni-Dish, the first text-to-image generation model specifically tailored for Chinese dishes. We develop a comprehensive dish curation pipeline, building the largest dish dataset to date. Additionally, we introduce a recaption strategy and employ a coarse-to-fine training scheme to help the model better learn fine-grained culinary nuances. During inference, we enhance the user's textual input using a pre-constructed high-quality caption library and a large language model, enabling more photorealistic and faithful image generation. Furthermore, to extend our model's capability for dish editing tasks, we propose Concept-Enhanced P2P. Based on this approach, we build a dish editing dataset and train a specialized editing model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, ML-based solutions remain difficult to deploy in practice. Many existing approaches only optimize the predictive performance of their models, overlooking the practical challenges of running them against network traffic in real time. This is especially problematic in the domain of traffic analysis, where the efficiency of the serving pipeline is a critical factor in determining the usability of a model. In this work, we introduce CATO, a framework that addresses this problem by jointly optimizing the predictive performance and the associated systems costs of the serving pipeline. CATO leverages recent advances in multi-objective Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal configurations, and automatically compiles end-to-end optimized serving pipelines that can be deployed in real networks. Our evaluations show that compared to popular feature optimization techniques, CATO can provide up to 3600x lower inference latency and 3.7x higher zero-loss throughput while simultaneously achieving better model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>22nd ...</summary><p>22nd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation</p></details> |

While server-based deployments remain the locus of peak performance, the imperative for on-device inference, necessitated by privacy and efficiency considerations, persists. Recognizing GPUs as the on-device ML accelerator with the widest reach, we present ML Drift--an optimized framework that extends the capabilities of state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated inference engines. ML Drift enables on-device execution of generative AI workloads which contain 10 to 100x more parameters than existing on-device generative AI models. ML Drift addresses intricate engineering challenges associated with cross-GPU API development, and ensures broad compatibility across mobile and desktop/laptop platforms, thereby facilitating the deployment of significantly more complex models on resource-constrained devices. Our GPU-accelerated ML/AI inference engine achieves an order-of-magnitude performance improvement relative to existing open-source GPU inference engines.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in CVPR 2025 Workshop on Efficient and On-Device Generation (EDGE)</p></details> |

These characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

Most existing taint analyses use whole-program static analysis, leading to scalability challenges. Type-based checking is a promising alternative, as it enables modular and incremental checking for fast performance. However, type-based approaches have not been widely adopted in practice, due to challenges with false positives and annotating existing codebases. In this paper, we present a new approach to type-based checking of taint properties that addresses these challenges, based on two key techniques. First, we present a new type-based tainting checker with significantly reduced false positives, via more practical handling of third-party libraries and other language constructs. Second, we present a novel technique to automatically infer tainting type qualifiers for existing code. Our technique supports inference of generic type argument annotations, crucial for tainting properties. We implemented our techniques in a tool TaintTyper and evaluated it on real-world benchmarks. TaintTyper exceeds the recall of a state-of-the-art whole-program taint analyzer, with comparable precision, and 2.93X-22.9X faster checking time. Further, TaintTyper infers annotations comparable to those written by hand, suitable for insertion into source code. TaintTyper is a promising new approach to efficient and practical taint checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of ECOOP 2025 paper</p></details> |

Deep Reinforcement Learning holds the promises for developing agents able to learn complex behaviours simply by interacting with their environment. This paper investigates the use of Reinforcement Learning for the satellite attitude control problem, namely the angular reorientation of a spacecraft with respect to an in- ertial frame of reference. In the proposed approach, a set of control policies are implemented as neural networks trained with a custom version of the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to maneuver a small satellite from a random starting angle to a given pointing target. In particular, we address the problem for two working conditions: the nominal case, in which all the actuators (a set of 3 reac- tion wheels) are working properly, and the underactuated case, where an actuator failure is simulated randomly along with one of the axes. We show that the agents learn to effectively perform large-angle slew maneuvers with fast convergence and industry-standard pointing accuracy. Furthermore, we test the proposed method on representative hardware, showing that by taking adequate measures controllers trained in simulation can perform well in real systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Originally presented at the NeurIPS 2021 Workshop on Deployable Decision-Making in Embodied Systems</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Personalization and Control in Scientific Personalized Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02790v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized search is a problem where models benefit from learning user preferences from per-user historical interaction data. The inferred preferences enable personalized ranking models to improve the relevance of documents for users. However, personalization is also seen as opaque in its use of historical interactions and is not amenable to users' control. Further, personalization limits the diversity of information users are exposed to. While search results may be automatically diversified this does little to address the lack of control over personalization. In response, we introduce a model for personalized search that enables users to control personalized rankings proactively. Our model, CtrlCE, is a novel cross-encoder model augmented with an editable memory built from users' historical interactions. The editable memory allows cross-encoders to be personalized efficiently and enables users to control personalized ranking. Next, because all queries do not require personalization, we introduce a calibrated mixing model which determines when personalization is necessary. This enables users to control personalization via their editable memory only when necessary. To thoroughly evaluate CtrlCE, we demonstrate its empirical performance in four domains of science, its ability to selectively request user control in a calibration evaluation of the mixing model, and the control provided by its editable memory in a user study.</p></details> | SIGIR 2025 paper |

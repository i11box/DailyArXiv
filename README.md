| **[RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08826v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Byted...</summary><p>Bytedance Seed Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[TweakLLM: A Routing Architecture for Dynamic Tailoring of Cached Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23674v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) process millions of queries daily, making efficient response caching a compelling optimization for reducing cost and latency. However, preserving relevance to user queries using this approach proves difficult due to the personalized nature of chatbot interactions and the limited accuracy of semantic similarity search. To address this, we present TweakLLM, a novel routing architecture that employs a lightweight LLM to dynamically adapt cached responses to incoming prompts. Through comprehensive evaluation, including user studies with side-by-side comparisons, satisfaction voting, as well as multi-agent LLM debates, we demonstrate that TweakLLM maintains response quality comparable to frontier models while significantly improving cache effectiveness. Our results across real-world datasets highlight TweakLLM as a scalable, resource-efficient caching solution for high-volume LLM deployments without compromising user experience.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Survey of TinyML Applications in Beekeeping for Hive Monitoring and Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08822v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints. Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven, and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator management.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

| **[RoboChemist: Long-Horizon and Safety-Compliant Robotic Chemical Experimentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08820v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CoRL 2025, Project Page: https://zzongzheng0918.github.io/RoboChemist.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Subjective Behaviors and Preferences in LLM: Language of Browsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15474v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks, purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences. We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language", albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask: (i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM? (ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences? (iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[A comparative study of efficient multigrid solvers for high-order local discontinuous Galerkin methods: Poisson, elliptic interface, and multiphase Stokes problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12506v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We design and investigate a variety of multigrid solvers for high-order local discontinuous Galerkin methods applied to elliptic interface and multiphase Stokes problems. Using the template of a standard multigrid V-cycle, we consider a variety of element-wise block smoothers, including Jacobi, multi-coloured Gauss-Seidel, processor-block Gauss-Seidel, and with special interest, smoothers based on sparse approximate inverse (SAI) methods. In particular, we develop SAI methods that: (i) balance the smoothing of velocity and pressure variables in Stokes problems; and (ii) robustly handles high-contrast viscosity coefficients in multiphase problems. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional test cases, including Poisson, elliptic interface, steady-state Stokes, and unsteady Stokes problems, we examine a multitude of multigrid smoother and solver combinations. In every case, there is at least one approach that matches the performance of classical geometric multigrid algorithms, e.g., 4 to 8 iterations reduce the residual by 10 orders of magnitude. We also discuss their relative merits with regard to simplicity, robustness, computational cost, and parallelisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 1 legend, 1 algorithm, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[MoVoC: Morphology-Aware Subword Construction for Geez Script Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08812v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subword-based tokenization methods often fail to preserve morphological boundaries, a limitation especially pronounced in low-resource, morphologically complex languages such as those written in the Geez script. To address this, we present MoVoC (Morpheme-aware Subword Vocabulary Construction) and train MoVoC-Tok, a tokenizer that integrates supervised morphological analysis into the subword vocabulary. This hybrid segmentation approach combines morpheme-based and Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokens to preserve morphological integrity while maintaining lexical meaning. To tackle resource scarcity, we curate and release manually annotated morpheme data for four Geez script languages and a morpheme-aware vocabulary for two of them. While the proposed tokenization method does not lead to significant gains in automatic translation quality, we observe consistent improvements in intrinsic metrics, MorphoScore, and Boundary Precision, highlighting the value of morphology-aware segmentation in enhancing linguistic fidelity and token efficiency. Our morpheme-annotated datasets and tokenizer will be publicly available to support further research in low-resource, morphologically rich languages. Our code and data are available on GitHub: https://github.com/hailaykidu/MoVoC</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is approximately 10 pages in length and includes 1 figure and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating LLMs Without Oracle Feedback: Agentic Annotation Evaluation Through Unsupervised Consistency Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08809v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), when paired with prompt-based tasks, have significantly reduced data annotation costs and reliance on human annotators. However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent (CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs in Formalizing Specifications: Retrieval-Augmented Parsing with Expert Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08808v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |
| **[Scaling Truth: The Confidence Paradox in AI Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08803v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures, reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions, with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 26 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[PianoVAM: A Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08800v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR) community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels, and rich metadata. The dataset was recorded using a Disklavier piano, capturing audio and MIDI from amateur pianists during their daily practice sessions, alongside synchronized top-view videos in realistic and varied performance conditions. Hand landmarks and fingering labels were extracted using a pretrained hand pose estimation model and a semi-automated fingering annotation algorithm. We discuss the challenges encountered during data collection and the alignment process across different modalities. Additionally, we describe our fingering annotation method based on hand landmarks extracted from videos. Finally, we present benchmarking results for both audio-only and audio-visual piano transcription using the PianoVAM dataset and discuss additional potential applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 26th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference, 2025</p></details> |
| **[CURE: Controlled Unlearning for Robust Embeddings -- Mitigating Conceptual Shortcuts in Pre-Trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05230v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp, while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025)</p></details> |

Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00074v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages: 10 main (incl. 9 figures), 3 references, and 27 appendix.

| **[Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Spectral-Element Methods for the Spherical Shallow Water Equations in Covariant Form](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08790v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce discontinuous spectral-element methods of arbitrary order that are well balanced, conservative of mass, and conservative or dissipative of total energy (i.e., a mathematical entropy function) for a covariant flux formulation of the rotating shallow water equations with variable bottom topography on curved manifolds such as the sphere. The proposed methods are based on a skew-symmetric splitting of the tensor divergence in covariant form, which we implement and analyze within a general flux-differencing framework using tensor-product summation-by-parts operators. Such schemes are proven to satisfy semi-discrete mass and energy conservation on general unstructured quadrilateral grids in addition to well balancing for arbitrary continuous bottom topographies, with energy dissipation resulting from a suitable choice of numerical interface flux. Furthermore, the proposed covariant formulation permits an analytical representation of the geometry and associated metric terms while satisfying the aforementioned entropy stability, conservation, and well-balancing properties without the need to approximate the metric terms so as to enforce discrete metric identities. Numerical experiments on cubed-sphere grids are presented in order to verify the schemes' structure-preservation properties as well as to assess their accuracy and robustness within the context of several standard test cases characteristic of idealized atmospheric flows. Our theoretical and numerical results support the further development of the proposed methodology towards a full dynamical core for numerical weather prediction and climate modelling, as well as broader applications to other hyperbolic and advection-dominated systems of partial differential equations on curved manifolds.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Doubly robust average treatment effect estimation for survival data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08788v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Considering censored outcomes in survival analysis can lead to quite complex results in the model setting of causal inference. Causal inference has attracted a lot of attention over the past few years, but little research has been done on survival analysis. Even for the only research conducted, the machine learning method was considered assuming a large sample, which is not suitable in that the actual data are high dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) method. Therefore, penalty is considered for numerous covariates, and the relationship between these covariates and treatment variables is reflected as a covariate balancing property score (CBPS). It also considers censored results. To this end, we will try to solve the above-mentioned problems by using penalized empirical likelihood, which considers both estimating equation and penalty. The proposed average treatment effect (ATE) estimator possesses the oracle property, exhibiting key characteristics such as double robustness for unbiasedness, sparsity in model selection, and asymptotic normality.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Narrative-Guided Reinforcement Learning: A Platform for Studying Language Model Influence on Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08785v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Abstract for RLDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[ADHDeepNet From Raw EEG to Diagnosis: Improving ADHD Diagnosis through Temporal-Spatial Processing, Adaptive Attention Mechanisms, and Explainability in Raw EEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08779v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls), employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy. Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner 2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation. ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 figures. Preprint.

A Cross-Architecture Analysis of Recall Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08778v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall. However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA, Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Calibrating MLLM-as-a-judge via Multimodal Bayesian Prompt Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08777v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion (JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling, JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation. JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

| **[Distributed Algorithms for Potential Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12038v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we present a fast distributed algorithm for local potential problems: these are graph problems where the task is to find a locally optimal solution where no node can unilaterally improve the utility in its local neighborhood by changing its own label. A simple example of such a problem is the task of finding a locally optimal cut, i.e., a cut where for each node at least half of its incident edges are cut edges. The distributed round complexity of locally optimal cut has been wide open; the problem is known to require $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds in the deterministic LOCAL model and $\Omega(\log \log n)$ rounds in the randomized LOCAL model, but the only known upper bound is the trivial brute-force solution of $O(n)$ rounds. Locally optimal cut in bounded-degree graphs is perhaps the simplest example of a locally checkable labeling problem for which there is still such a large gap between current upper and lower bounds. We show that in bounded-degree graphs, all local potential problems, including locally optimal cut, can be solved in $\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds, both in the deterministic and randomized LOCAL models. In particular, the deterministic round complexity of the locally optimal cut problem is now settled to $\log^{\Theta(1)} n$.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figures.

Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz. Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs. BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASME IDETC/CIE 2025 (DETC2025-168977).

A critical yet often overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation.

However, no public dataset includes the required triplet of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core, ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions.

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, 39 pages, 16 figures.

However, despite their successes, existing approaches often suffer from planning hallucinations and require retraining for each new agent. To address these challenges, we propose the Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework, , which enhances agent planning capabilities by directly incorporating explicit guidance. Unlike previous methods that rely on complex knowledge, which either require significant human effort or lack quality assurance, MPO leverages high-level general guidance through meta plans to assist agent planning and enables continuous optimization of the meta plans based on feedback from the agent's task execution. Our experiments conducted on two representative tasks demonstrate that MPO significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, our analysis indicates that MPO provides a plug-and-play solution that enhances both task completion efficiency and generalization capabilities in previous unseen scenarios.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder. Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general 2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected. Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman dataset, demonstrating its generalizability.

Much of the progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by $10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to train more expressive models on larger systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>AI4MA...</summary><p>AI4MAT-ICLR-2025 Spotlight https://openreview.net/forum?id=XACVRYePQQ</p></details> |

However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability) alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired. As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments. We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse hardware and models during an open-source demo.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

The proposed approach, PQMass, provides a statistically rigorous method for assessing the performance of a single generative model or the comparison of multiple competing models. PQMass divides the sample space into non-overlapping regions and applies chi-squared tests to the number of data samples that fall within each region, giving a p-value that measures the probability that the bin counts derived from two sets of samples are drawn from the same multinomial distribution. PQMass does not depend on assumptions regarding the density of the true distribution, nor does it rely on training or fitting any auxiliary models. We evaluate PQMass on data of various modalities and dimensions, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing the quality, novelty, and diversity of generated samples. We further show that PQMass scales well to moderately high-dimensional data and thus obviates the need for feature extraction in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

A Cross-Architecture Analysis of Recall Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08778v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how Transformer-based language models store and retrieve factual associations is critical for improving interpretability and enabling targeted model editing. Prior work, primarily on GPT-style models, has identified MLP modules in early layers as key contributors to factual recall. However, it remains unclear whether these findings generalize across different autoregressive architectures. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of factual recall across several models -- including GPT, LLaMA, Qwen, and DeepSeek -- analyzing where and how factual information is encoded and accessed. Consequently, we find that Qwen-based models behave differently from previous patterns: attention modules in the earliest layers contribute more to factual recall than MLP modules. Our findings suggest that even within the autoregressive Transformer family, architectural variations can lead to fundamentally different mechanisms of factual recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

| **[Permutation-Avoiding FFT-Based Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12718v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) libraries are widely used for evaluating discrete convolutions. Most FFT implementations follow some variant of the Cooley-Tukey framework, in which the transform is decomposed into butterfly operations and index-reversal permutations. While butterfly operations dominate the floating-point operation count, the memory access patterns induced by index-reversal permutations significantly degrade the FFT's arithmetic intensity. When performing discrete convolution, the three sets of index-reversal permutations which occur in FFT-based implementations using Cooley-Tukey frameworks cancel out, thus paving the way to implementations free of any permutation. To the best of our knowledge, such permutation-free variants of FFT-based discrete convolution are not commonly used in practice, making such kernels worth investigating. Here, we look into such permutation-avoiding convolution procedures for multi-dimensional cases within a general radix Cooley-Tukey framework. We perform numerical experiments to benchmark the algorithms presented against state-of-the-art FFT-based convolution implementations. Our results suggest that developers of FFT libraries should consider supporting permutation-avoiding convolution kernels.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 22 tables, 2 figures, 22 algorithms</p></details> |

However, these advancements have led to a substantial increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework". Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2 embedded AI device.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases</p></details> |

| **[Accelerating Diffusion Transformer-Based Text-to-Speech with Transformer Layer Caching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08696v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a method to accelerate the inference process of diffusion transformer (DiT)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models by applying a selective caching mechanism to transformer layers. Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining. Example inference results can be heard at https://siratish.github.io/F5-TTS_SmoothCache/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

In digital geometry, Sturmian words correspond to discrete approximations of straight line segments in the Euclidean plane. The Dorst-Smeulders coding, introduced in 1984, is a 4-tuple of integers that uniquely represents a Sturmian word $w$, enabling its reconstruction using $|w|$ modular operations, making it highly efficient in practice. In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm that, given a binary input word $w$, computes the Dorst-Smeulders coding of its longest Sturmian prefix. This forms the basis for computing the Dorst-Smeulders coding of an arbitrary binary word $w$, which is a minimal decomposition (in terms of the number of factors) of $w$ into Sturmian words, each represented by its Dorst-Smeulders coding. This coding could be leveraged in compression schemes where the input is transformed into a binary word composed of long Sturmian segments. Although the algorithm is conceptually simple and can be implemented in just a few lines of code, it is grounded in a deep analysis of the structural properties of Sturmian words.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, presented at SPIRE 2025 (proceedings upcoming)</p></details> |

As an emerging technical means, the new six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) system can effectively improve the communication and sensing performance of ISAC systems. However, related research on the architecture based on three-dimensional rotatable antennas (RA) remains relatively limited. Especially under the influence of non-ideal channel characteristics, how to balance system performance and hardware cost control through beamforming technology in non-ideal channels has become a crucial issue to be solved urgently. Given the significant advantages of hybrid beamforming technology in balancing system performance and hardware complexity, this paper focuses on the channel model considering effective aperture loss under the RA architecture and studies the sub-connected hybrid beamforming design for multi-user ISAC systems. Aiming at the non-convex nature with coupled variables in this problem, this paper first transforms the complex fractional objective function using the Fractional Programming (FP) framework, and then proposes an algorithm based on the Alternating Optimization (AO) architecture, which achieves optimization by alternately solving five subproblems. Among them, the closed-form update expression of the array rotation angle is derived through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a two-stage Gradient Ascent (GA) based method is proposed to optimize the antenna rotation angle. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA), the proposed method can significantly improve the overall performance of the system.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

Extending Transformer's success to safety-critical domains requires calibrated uncertainty estimation which remains under-explored. To address this, we propose Sparse Gaussian Process attention (SGPA), which performs Bayesian inference directly in the output space of multi-head attention blocks (MHAs) in transformer to calibrate its uncertainty. It replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel and uses sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) techniques to approximate the posterior processes of MHA outputs.

| **[A Survey of World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11260v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs in autonomous driving have been propelled by advances in robust world modeling, fundamentally transforming how vehicles interpret dynamic scenes and execute safe decision-making. World models have emerged as a linchpin technology, offering high-fidelity representations of the driving environment that integrate multi-sensor data, semantic cues, and temporal dynamics. This paper systematically reviews recent advances in world models for autonomous driving, proposing a three-tiered taxonomy: (i) Generation of Future Physical World, covering Image-, BEV-, OG-, and PC-based generation methods that enhance scene evolution modeling through diffusion models and 4D occupancy forecasting; (ii) Behavior Planning for Intelligent Agents, combining rule-driven and learning-based paradigms with cost map optimization and reinforcement learning for trajectory generation in complex traffic conditions; (ii) Interaction between Prediction and Planning, achieving multi-agent collaborative decision-making through latent space diffusion and memory-augmented architectures. The study further analyzes training paradigms, including self-supervised learning, multimodal pretraining, and generative data augmentation, while evaluating world models' performance in scene understanding and motion prediction tasks. Future research must address key challenges in self-supervised representation learning, multimodal fusion, and advanced simulation to advance the practical deployment of world models in complex urban environments. Overall, the comprehensive analysis provides a technical roadmap for harnessing the transformative potential of world models in advancing safe and reliable autonomous driving solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing project.

Such approximations are widely used tools in implementing many learned data structures, which mix learning models with traditional algorithmic design blocks to exploit regularities in the underlying data distribution, providing novel and effective space-time trade-offs. We introduce the first lower bounds to the cost of storing PLAs in two settings, namely compression and indexing. We then compare these compressibility measures to known data structures, and show that they are asymptotically optimal up to a constant factor from the space lower bounds. Finally, we design the first data structures for the aforementioned settings that achieve the space lower bounds plus small additive terms, which turn out to be succinct in most practical cases. Our data structures support the efficient retrieval and evaluation of a segment in the (compressed) PLA for a given $x$-value, which is a core operation in any learned data structure relying on PLAs. As a result, our paper offers the first theoretical analysis of the maximum compressibility achievable by PLA-based learned data structures, and provides novel storage schemes for PLAs offering strong theoretical guarantees while also suggesting simple and efficient practical implementations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 36th International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC)</p></details> |

The training was made from scratch with a mere focus on theoretically and experimentally exploring the architectural strengths of the proposed hybrid model. Experiments were conducted across varied data fractions with balanced and imbalanced training datasets. Comparatively, the hybrid model, complementing the strengths of CNN and ViT, achieved the highest recall of 0.9443 (50% data fraction in balanced) and consistency in F1 score around 0.85, suggesting reliability in diagnosis. Additionally, the model was successful in outperforming CNN and ViT in imbalanced datasets.

LYT-Net consists of several layers and detachable blocks, including our novel blocks--Channel-Wise Denoiser (CWD) and Multi-Stage Squeeze & Excite Fusion (MSEF)--along with the traditional Transformer block, Multi-Headed Self-Attention (MHSA). In our method we adopt a dual-path approach, treating chrominance channels U and V and luminance channel Y as separate entities to help the model better handle illumination adjustment and corruption restoration. Our comprehensive evaluation on established LLIE datasets demonstrates that, despite its low complexity, our model outperforms recent LLIE methods.

| **[MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

We present LSMTCR, a scalable multi-architecture framework that separates specificity from constraint learning to enable de novo, epitope-conditioned generation of paired, full-length TCRs. A diffusion-enhanced BERT encoder learns time-conditioned epitope representations; conditional GPT decoders, pretrained on CDR3$\beta$ and transferred to CDR3$\alpha$, generate chain-specific CDR3s under cross-modal conditioning with temperature-controlled diversity; and a gene-aware Transformer assembles complete $\alpha\beta$ sequences by predicting V/J usage to ensure immunogenetic fidelity. Across GLIPH, TEP, MIRA, McPAS and our curated dataset, LSMTCR achieves higher predicted binding than baselines on most datasets, more faithfully recovers positional and length grammars, and delivers superior, temperature-tunable diversity. For $\alpha$-chain generation, transfer learning improves predicted binding, length realism and diversity over representative methods. Full-length assembly from known or de novo CDR3s preserves k-mer spectra, yields low edit distances to references, and, in paired $\alpha\beta$ co-modelling with epitope, attains higher pTM/ipTM than single-chain settings. LSMTCR outputs diverse, gene-contextualized, full-length TCR designs from epitope input alone, enabling high-throughput screening and iterative optimization.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

The results show that the Transformer model outperforms traditional methods, offering a promising solution for reliable and sustainable power system operation.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Too Helpful, Too Harmless, Too Honest or Just Right?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08486v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified, alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.</p></details> | EMNLP'25 Main |

This capability is especially critical in the legal domain. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end RAG pipeline that improves upon previous baselines using three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NLLP 2025 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[SINDI: an Efficient Index for Approximate Maximum Inner Product Search on Sparse Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08395v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse vector Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is crucial in multi-path retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Recent inverted index-based and graph-based algorithms have achieved high search accuracy with practical efficiency. However, their performance in production environments is often limited by redundant distance computations and frequent random memory accesses. Furthermore, the compressed storage format of sparse vectors hinders the use of SIMD acceleration. In this paper, we propose the sparse inverted non-redundant distance index (SINDI), which incorporates three key optimizations: (i) Efficient Inner Product Computation: SINDI leverages SIMD acceleration and eliminates redundant identifier lookups, enabling batched inner product computation; (ii) Memory-Friendly Design: SINDI replaces random memory accesses to original vectors with sequential accesses to inverted lists, substantially reducing memory-bound latency. (iii) Vector Pruning: SINDI retains only the high-magnitude non-zero entries of vectors, improving query throughput while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate SINDI on multiple real-world datasets. Experimental results show that SINDI achieves state-of-the-art performance across datasets of varying scales, languages, and models. On the MsMarco dataset, when Recall@50 exceeds 99%, SINDI delivers single-thread query-per-second (QPS) improvements ranging from 4.2 to 26.4 times compared with SEISMIC and PyANNs. Notably, SINDI has been integrated into Ant Group's open-source vector search library, VSAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, submitted to VLDB 2026</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Causality-Aware Vision-Based 3D Occupancy Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08388v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding. Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular 2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

This paper proposes a vision-based framework with three targeted improvements. First, we introduce an occlusion-aware adaptive lifting mechanism incorporating depth denoising. This enhances the robustness of 2D-to-3D feature transformation while mitigating reliance on depth priors. Second, we enforce 3D-2D semantic consistency via jointly optimized prototypes, using confidence- and category-aware sampling to address the long-tail classes problem. Third, to streamline joint prediction, we devise a BEV-centric cost volume to explicitly correlate semantic and flow features, supervised by a hybrid classification-regression scheme that handles diverse motion scales. Our purely convolutional architecture establishes new SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks for both semantic occupancy and joint occupancy semantic-flow prediction. We also present a family of models offering a spectrum of efficiency-performance trade-offs. Our real-time version exceeds all existing real-time methods in speed and accuracy, ensuring its practical viability.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks, random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.</p></details> | 4 pages |

However, most computational methods remain limited in their generalizability across diverse peptide functions. Here, we present PDeepPP, a unified deep learning framework that integrates pretrained protein language models with a hybrid transformer-convolutional architecture, enabling robust identification across diverse peptide classes and PTM sites. We curated comprehensive benchmark datasets and implemented strategies to address data imbalance, allowing PDeepPP to systematically extract both global and local sequence features. Through extensive analyses-including dimensionality reduction and comparison studies-PDeepPP demonstrates strong, interpretable peptide representations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in 25 of the 33 biological identification tasks. Notably, PDeepPP attains high accuracy in antimicrobial (0.9726) and phosphorylation site (0.9984) identification, with 99.5% specificity in glycosylation site prediction and substantial reduction in false negatives in antimalarial tasks.

This work bridges the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) optimization.

Leveraging additional modalities (X-modality) like thermal and depth alongside traditional RGB provides complementary information, enabling more robust and reliable prediction. In this work, we introduce Sigma, a Siamese Mamba network for multi-modal semantic segmentation utilizing the advanced Mamba. Unlike conventional methods that rely on CNNs, with their limited local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers (ViTs), which offer global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic complexity, our model achieves global receptive fields with linear complexity. By employing a Siamese encoder and innovating a Mamba-based fusion mechanism, we effectively select essential information from different modalities. A decoder is then developed to enhance the channel-wise modeling ability of the model. Our proposed method is rigorously evaluated on both RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating its superiority and marking the first successful application of State Space Models (SSMs) in multi-modal perception tasks.

| **[Towards Knowledge-Aware Document Systems: Modeling Semantic Coverage Relations via Answerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08304v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how information is shared across documents, regardless of the format in which it is expressed, is critical for tasks such as information retrieval, summarization, and content alignment. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for modelling Semantic Coverage Relations (SCR), which classifies document pairs based on how their informational content aligns. We define three core relation types: equivalence, where both texts convey the same information using different textual forms or styles; inclusion, where one document fully contains the information of another and adds more; and semantic overlap, where each document presents partially overlapping content. To capture these relations, we adopt a question answering (QA)-based approach, using the answerability of shared questions across documents as an indicator of semantic coverage. We construct a synthetic dataset derived from the SQuAD corpus by paraphrasing source passages and selectively omitting information, enabling precise control over content overlap. This dataset allows us to benchmark generative language models and train transformer-based classifiers for SCR prediction. Our findings demonstrate that discriminative models significantly outperform generative approaches, with the RoBERTa-base model achieving the highest accuracy of 61.4% and the Random Forest-based model showing the best balance with a macro-F1 score of 52.9%. The results show that QA provides an effective lens for assessing semantic relations across stylistically diverse texts, offering insights into the capacity of current models to reason about information beyond surface similarity. The dataset and code developed in this study are publicly available to support reproducibility.</p></details> | 27 pages, 1 figure |

CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches. We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource. CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards, with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on advancing clinical AI.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

However, as the number of frames increases, the memory consumption for training and inference increases substantially, posing challenges in resource-constrained scenarios. Inspired by the success of traditional video compression frameworks, which process video frame by frame and can efficiently compress long videos, we adopt this modeling strategy for INRs to decrease memory consumption, while aiming to unify the frameworks from the perspective of timeline-based autoregressive modeling. In this work, we present a novel understanding of INR models from an autoregressive (AR) perspective and introduce a Unified AutoRegressive Framework for memory-efficient Neural Video Compression (UAR-NVC). UAR-NVC integrates timeline-based and INR-based neural video compression under a unified autoregressive paradigm. It partitions videos into several clips and processes each clip using a different INR model instance, leveraging the advantages of both compression frameworks while allowing seamless adaptation to either in form. To further reduce temporal redundancy between clips, we design two modules to optimize the initialization, training, and compression of these model parameters. UAR-NVC supports adjustable latencies by varying the clip length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UAR-NVC, with its flexible video clip setting, can adapt to resource-constrained environments and significantly improve performance compared to different baseline models.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy, 99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0% accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%, outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment in real-world clinical screening systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.

| **[Handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs in Formalizing Specifications: Retrieval-Augmented Parsing with Expert Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08808v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of Open-Vocabulary Constructs(OVCs) -- ones not known beforehand -- in the context of converting natural language (NL) specifications into formal languages (e.g., temporal logic or code). Models fare poorly on OVCs due to a lack of necessary knowledge a priori. In such situations, a domain expert can provide correct constructs at inference time based on their preferences or domain knowledge. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge for future parses without retraining the model. We present dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing(DKAP), where in addition to the input sentence, the model receives (dynamically growing) expert knowledge as a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs. We propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses this lexicon. A retriever and a generator are trained to find and use the key-value store to produce the correct parse. A key challenge lies in curating data for this retrieval-augmented parser. We utilize synthetic data generation and the data augmentation techniques on annotated (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs to train the augmented parser. To improve training effectiveness, we propose multiple strategies to teach models to focus on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm modeled after the DKAP problem and simulate the scenario across three formalization tasks (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2024</p></details> |

Causal inference has attracted a lot of attention over the past few years, but little research has been done on survival analysis. Even for the only research conducted, the machine learning method was considered assuming a large sample, which is not suitable in that the actual data are high dimensional low sample size (HDLSS) method. Therefore, penalty is considered for numerous covariates, and the relationship between these covariates and treatment variables is reflected as a covariate balancing property score (CBPS). It also considers censored results. To this end, we will try to solve the above-mentioned problems by using penalized empirical likelihood, which considers both estimating equation and penalty. The proposed average treatment effect (ATE) estimator possesses the oracle property, exhibiting key characteristics such as double robustness for unbiasedness, sparsity in model selection, and asymptotic normality.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Distributed Algorithms for Potential Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12038v3)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we present a fast distributed algorithm for local potential problems: these are graph problems where the task is to find a locally optimal solution where no node can unilaterally improve the utility in its local neighborhood by changing its own label. A simple example of such a problem is the task of finding a locally optimal cut, i.e., a cut where for each node at least half of its incident edges are cut edges. The distributed round complexity of locally optimal cut has been wide open; the problem is known to require $\Omega(\log n)$ rounds in the deterministic LOCAL model and $\Omega(\log \log n)$ rounds in the randomized LOCAL model, but the only known upper bound is the trivial brute-force solution of $O(n)$ rounds. Locally optimal cut in bounded-degree graphs is perhaps the simplest example of a locally checkable labeling problem for which there is still such a large gap between current upper and lower bounds. We show that in bounded-degree graphs, all local potential problems, including locally optimal cut, can be solved in $\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds, both in the deterministic and randomized LOCAL models. In particular, the deterministic round complexity of the locally optimal cut problem is now settled to $\log^{\Theta(1)} n$.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 4 figures.

Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data.

| **[Permutation-Avoiding FFT-Based Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12718v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) libraries are widely used for evaluating discrete convolutions. Most FFT implementations follow some variant of the Cooley-Tukey framework, in which the transform is decomposed into butterfly operations and index-reversal permutations. While butterfly operations dominate the floating-point operation count, the memory access patterns induced by index-reversal permutations significantly degrade the FFT's arithmetic intensity. When performing discrete convolution, the three sets of index-reversal permutations which occur in FFT-based implementations using Cooley-Tukey frameworks cancel out, thus paving the way to implementations free of any permutation. To the best of our knowledge, such permutation-free variants of FFT-based discrete convolution are not commonly used in practice, making such kernels worth investigating. Here, we look into such permutation-avoiding convolution procedures for multi-dimensional cases within a general radix Cooley-Tukey framework. We perform numerical experiments to benchmark the algorithms presented against state-of-the-art FFT-based convolution implementations. Our results suggest that developers of FFT libraries should consider supporting permutation-avoiding convolution kernels.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 22 tables, 2 figures, 22 algorithms</p></details> |

Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However, it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot navigation needs.

| **[AgentGym-RL: Training LLM Agents for Long-Horizon Decision Making through Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08755v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, 39 pages, 16 figures.

But hackers may compromise data lake storage to bypass access controls and access sensitive data. To address this, we propose Membrane, a system that (1) cryptographically enforces data-dependent access control views over a data lake, (2) without restricting the analytical queries data scientists can run. We observe that data lakes, unlike DBMSes, disaggregate computation and storage into separate trust domains, making at-rest encryption sufficient to defend against remote attackers targeting data lake storage, even when running analytical queries in plaintext. This leads to a new system design for Membrane that combines encryption at rest with SQL-aware encryption. Using block ciphers, a fast symmetric-key primitive with hardware acceleration in CPUs, we develop a new SQL-aware encryption protocol well-suited to at-rest encryption. Membrane adds overhead only at the start of an interactive session due to decrypting views, delaying the first query result by up to $\approx 20\times$; subsequent queries process decrypted data in plaintext, resulting in low amortized overhead.</p></details> | 28 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Sharing is Caring: Efficient LM Post-Training with Collective RL Experience Sharing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08721v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability) alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired. As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments. We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse hardware and models during an open-source demo.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Our model dynamically balances intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism. We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing work evaluates this task with exact match (EM), where predicted arguments must align exactly with annotated spans. While suitable for span-based models, this approach falls short for large language models (LLMs), which often generate diverse yet semantically accurate arguments. EM severely underestimates performance by disregarding valid variations. Furthermore, EM evaluation fails to capture implicit arguments (unstated but inferable) and scattered arguments (distributed across a document). These limitations underscore the need for an evaluation framework that better captures models' actual performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce REGen, a Reliable Evaluation framework for Generative event argument extraction. REGen combines the strengths of exact, relaxed, and LLM-based matching to better align with human judgment. Experiments on six datasets show that REGen reveals an average performance gain of +23.93 F1 over EM, reflecting capabilities overlooked by prior evaluation. Human validation further confirms REGen's effectiveness, achieving 87.67% alignment with human assessments of argument correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP-2025</p></details> |

Specifically, I integrate SmoothCache into the F5-TTS architecture, focusing on caching outputs of self-attention and feed-forward network layers to reduce redundant computations during the denoising process. A calibration phase is introduced to analyze L1 relative errors between timesteps, guiding the selection of cache schedules that minimize quality degradation. To address the problem of inter-layer dependency, a unified caching schedule is adopted, applying the cache pattern derived from self-attention layers to both layer types. Experiments on LibriSpeech-PC and Seed-TTS datasets evaluate various cache thresholds and denoising step configurations. Results show that caching at higher denoising steps reduces inference time without compromising output quality, whereas caching at lower steps can negatively impact synthesis quality similarly to reducing the total number of denoising steps. Objective and subjective metrics confirm the effectiveness of SmoothCache in maintaining performance while improving computational efficiency. Comparisons between cached inference and reduced-step inference further highlight the benefits of selective caching, especially under high-step configurations. This work demonstrates that transformer layer caching is a practical solution for optimizing diffusion transformer-based TTS models without requiring architectural changes or retraining.

Extending Transformer's success to safety-critical domains requires calibrated uncertainty estimation which remains under-explored. To address this, we propose Sparse Gaussian Process attention (SGPA), which performs Bayesian inference directly in the output space of multi-head attention blocks (MHAs) in transformer to calibrate its uncertainty. It replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel and uses sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) techniques to approximate the posterior processes of MHA outputs. Empirically, on a suite of prediction tasks on text, images and graphs, SGPA-based Transformers achieve competitive predictive accuracy, while noticeably improving both in-distribution calibration and out-of-distribution robustness and detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2023).

However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective, the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space. During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9 diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing benchmarks.</p></details> | BIBM |

While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we construct a benchmark dataset of over 1,200+ meticulously curated and diverse examples across English, Mandarin, Spanish, French, Japanese, and Korean. Each example underwent careful expert review to verify its Drivelological characteristics, involving multiple rounds of discussion and adjudication to address disagreements. Using this dataset, we evaluate a range of LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense, produce incoherent justifications, or miss implied rhetorical functions altogether. These findings highlight a deep representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at the EMNLP 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, methods based on reinforcement learning and imitation learning often suffer from high sample complexity, poor generalization, and low safety. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an efficient and generalized end-to-end autonomous driving system (EGADS) for complex and varied scenarios. The RL agent in our EGADS combines variational inference with normalizing flows, which are independent of distribution assumptions. This combination allows the agent to capture historical information relevant to driving in latent space effectively, thereby significantly reducing sample complexity. Additionally, we enhance safety by formulating robust safety constraints and improve generalization and performance by integrating RL with expert demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, EGADS significantly reduces sample complexity, greatly improves safety performance, and exhibits strong generalization capabilities in complex urban scenarios. Particularly, we contributed an expert dataset collected through human expert steering wheel control, specifically using the G29 steering wheel.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECML PKDD 2025 (Research Track)</p></details> |

Consequently, ensuring reliable offloading without QoS violations is challenging in distributed and unreliable edge environments. However, current edge offloading solutions are either centralized or do not adequately address challenges in distributed environments. We propose FRESCO, a fast and reliable edge offloading framework that utilizes a blockchain-based reputation system, which enhances the reliability of offloading in the distributed edge. The distributed reputation system tracks the historical performance of edge servers, while blockchain through a consensus mechanism ensures that sensitive reputation information is secured against tampering. However, blockchain consensus typically has high latency, and therefore we employ a Hybrid Smart Contract (HSC) that automatically computes and stores reputation securely on-chain (i.e., on the blockchain) while allowing fast offloading decisions off-chain (i.e., outside of blockchain). The offloading decision engine uses a reputation score to derive fast offloading decisions, which are based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT). The SMT models edge resource constraints, and QoS deadlines, and can formally guarantee a feasible solution that is valuable for latency-sensitive applications that require high reliability. With a combination of on-chain HSC reputation state management and an off-chain SMT decision engine, FRESCO offloads tasks to reliable servers without being hindered by blockchain consensus. We evaluate FRESCO against real availability traces and simulated applications. FRESCO reduces response time by up to 7.86 times and saves energy by up to 5.4% compared to all baselines while minimizing QoS violations to 0.4% and achieving an average decision time of 5.05 milliseconds.</p></details> | 15 pages, 21 figures |

However, their scalability to Large Language Models (LLMs) is fundamentally constrained by their vast parameter sizes. Notably, LLaMA-7B - the smallest model in LLaMA series - demands more than 1,000 cm2 of silicon area even in advanced CMOS nodes. This paper presents BitROM, the first CiROM-based accelerator that overcomes this limitation through co-design with BitNet's 1.58-bit quantization model, enabling practical and efficient LLM inference at the edge. BitROM introduces three key innovations: 1) a novel Bidirectional ROM Array that stores two ternary weights per transistor; 2) a Tri-Mode Local Accumulator optimized for ternary-weight computations; and 3) an integrated Decode-Refresh (DR) eDRAM that supports on-die KV-cache management, significantly reducing external memory access during decoding. In addition, BitROM integrates LoRA-based adapters to enable efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. Evaluated in 65nm CMOS, BitROM achieves 20.8 TOPS/W and a bit density of 4,967 kB/mm2 - offering a 10x improvement in area efficiency over prior digital CiROM designs. Moreover, the DR eDRAM contributes to a 43.6% reduction in external DRAM access, further enhancing deployment efficiency for LLMs in edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASP-DAC 2026</p></details> |

It allows to define which tasks it can be assigned to and which it cannot. We will refer to this knowledge as the Capability concept. As capabilities stems from the components the robot owns, they can be linked together. In this work, we hypothesize that this concept can be inferred from the components rather than merely linked to them. Therefore, we introduce an ontological means of inferring the agent's capabilities based on the components it owns as well as low-level capabilities. This inference allows the agent to acknowledge what it is able to do in a responsive way and it is generalizable to external entities the agent can carry for example. To initiate an action, the robot needs to link its capabilities with external entities. To do so, it needs to infer affordance relations from its capabilities as well as the external entity's dispositions. This work is part of a broader effort to integrate social affordances into a Human-Robot collaboration context and is an extension of an already existing ontology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Workshop on Working towards Ontology-based Standards for Robotics and Automation (WOSRA 2023 - 2nd Edition), Jun 2023, Londres, United Kingdom</p></details> |

Existing solutions often require additional context, expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention, enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software testing.</p></details> | 2025 HUMIES finalist |

While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree (FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation, enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path, FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle configuration.

Experimental results demonstrate that FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable worlds.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |
| **[TerraMind: Large-Scale Generative Multimodality for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11171v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code are open-sourced under a permissive license.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV'25 |

Current approaches often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM) makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities, including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module, a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition; and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space (I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp), which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Alternating Minimization Schemes for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions with $f$-Divergence Perception Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15015v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the computation of the rate-distortion-perception function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter average distortion constraint and a perception constraint belonging to the family of $f$-divergences. In this setting, the RDPF forms a convex programming problem for which we characterize optimal parametric solutions. We employ the developed solutions in an alternating minimization scheme, namely Optimal Alternating Minimization (OAM), for which we provide convergence guarantees. Nevertheless, the OAM scheme does not lead to a direct implementation of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm due to implicit equations in the iteration's structure. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two alternative minimization approaches whose applicability depends on the smoothness of the used perception metric: a Newton-based Alternating Minimization (NAM) scheme, relying on Newton's root-finding method for the approximation of the optimal solution of the iteration, and a Relaxed Alternating Minimization (RAM) scheme, based on relaxing the OAM iterates. We show, by deriving necessary and sufficient conditions, that both schemes guarantee convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient conditions on the distortion and perception constraints, which guarantee that the proposed algorithms converge exponentially fast in the number of iteration steps. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical simulations and establish connections with existing results.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Too Helpful, Too Harmless, Too Honest or Just Right?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08486v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, yet aligning their outputs with the principles of Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (HHH) remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods often optimize for individual alignment dimensions in isolation, leading to trade-offs and inconsistent behavior. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures offer modularity, they suffer from poorly calibrated routing, limiting their effectiveness in alignment tasks. We propose TrinityX, a modular alignment framework that incorporates a Mixture of Calibrated Experts (MoCaE) within the Transformer architecture. TrinityX leverages separately trained experts for each HHH dimension, integrating their outputs through a calibrated, task-adaptive routing mechanism that combines expert signals into a unified, alignment-aware representation. Extensive experiments on three standard alignment benchmarks-Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty)-demonstrate that TrinityX outperforms strong baselines, achieving relative improvements of 32.5% in win rate, 33.9% in safety score, and 28.4% in truthfulness. In addition, TrinityX reduces memory usage and inference latency by over 40% compared to prior MoE-based approaches. Ablation studies highlight the importance of calibrated routing, and cross-model evaluations confirm TrinityX's generalization across diverse LLM backbones.</p></details> | EMNLP'25 Main |

Typically, traditional interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion, especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance compared to two baseline controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 22nd International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotic - ICINCO 2025</p></details> |
| **[LD-ViCE: Latent Diffusion Model for Video Counterfactual Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08422v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.</p></details> | 30 pages |

However, traditional workflows defer validation process until RTL design and SoC integration are complete, significantly prolonging development and iteration cycle. In this work, we present FASE framework, FPGA-Assisted Syscall Emulation, the first work for adapt syscall emulation on FPGA platforms, enabling complex multi-thread benchmarks to directly run on the processor design without integrating SoC or target OS for early-stage performance validation. FASE introduces three key innovations to address three critical challenges for adapting FPGA-based syscall emulation: (1) only a minimal CPU interface is exposed, with other hardware components untouched, addressing the lack of a unified hardware interface in FPGA systems; (2) a Host-Target Protocol (HTP) is proposed to minimize cross-device data traffic, mitigating the low-bandwidth and high-latency communication between FPGA and host; and (3) a host-side runtime is proposed to remotely handle Linux-style system calls, addressing the challenge of cross-device syscall delegation. Experiments ware conducted on Xilinx FPGA with open-sourced RISC-V SMP processor Rocket. With single-thread CoreMark, FASE introduces less than 1% performance error and achieves over 2000x higher efficiency compared to Proxy Kernel due to FPGA acceleration. With complex OpenMP benchmarks, FASE demonstrates over 96% performance validation accuracy for most single-thread workloads and over 91.5% for most multi-thread workloads compared to full SoC validation, significantly reducing development complexity and time-to-feedback. All components of FASE framework are released as open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 19 figures, to be submitted to IEEE TCAD</p></details> |
| **[FAMES: Fast Approximate Multiplier Substitution for Mixed-Precision Quantized DNNs--Down to 2 Bits!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18055v4)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A widely-used technique in designing energy-efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators is quantization. Recent progress in this direction has reduced the bitwidths used in DNN down to 2. Meanwhile, many prior works apply approximate multipliers (AppMuls) in designing DNN accelerators to lower their energy consumption. Unfortunately, these works still assume a bitwidth much larger than 2, which falls far behind the state-of-the-art in quantization area and even challenges the meaningfulness of applying AppMuls in DNN accelerators, since a high-bitwidth AppMul consumes much more energy than a low-bitwidth exact multiplier! Thus, an important problem to study is: Can approximate multipliers be effectively applied to quantized DNN models with very low bitwidths? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question and present a systematic solution that achieves the answer: FAMES, a fast approximate multiplier substitution method for mixed-precision DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate an average 28.67% energy reduction on state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantized models with bitwidths as low as 2 bits and accuracy losses kept under 1%. Additionally, our approach is up to 300x faster than previous genetic algorithm-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work will be incorporated into another study as part of a larger project, so we request to temporarily withdraw it.

| **[CoAT: Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts Framework for Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02390v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on LLM technologies is rapidly emerging, with most of them employ a 'fast thinking' approach to inference. Most LLMs generate the final result based solely on a single query and LLM's reasoning capabilities. However, with the advent of OpenAI-o1, 'slow thinking' techniques have garnered increasing attention because its process is closer to the human thought process. Inspired by the human ability to constantly associate and replenish knowledge during thinking, we developed the novel Chain-of-Associated-Thoughts (CoAT) framework, which introduces an innovative synergy between the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm and a dynamic mechanism for integrating new key information, termed 'associative memory'. By combining the structured exploration capabilities of MCTS with the adaptive learning capacity of associative memory, CoAT significantly expands the LLM search space, enabling our framework to explore diverse reasoning pathways and dynamically update its knowledge base in real-time. This allows the framework to not only revisit and refine earlier inferences but also adaptively incorporate evolving information, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and comprehensive. We validate CoAT's effectiveness across a variety of generative and reasoning tasks. Quantitative experiments show that CoAT achieves over 10% performance improvement on open-source multi-hop reasoning datasets (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and more than 15% gain on our proprietary CRB dataset.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Boosted Training of Lightweight Early Exits for Optimizing CNN Image Classification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08318v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets. Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy" samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples. This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions. Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment, we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10 dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45 percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation. These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Context-Aware Query Refinement for Target Sound Extraction: Handling Partially Matched Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08292v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target sound extraction (TSE) is the task of extracting a target sound specified by a query from an audio mixture. Much prior research has focused on the problem setting under the Fully Matched Query (FMQ) condition, where the query specifies only active sounds present in the mixture. However, in real-world scenarios, queries may include inactive sounds that are not present in the mixture. This leads to scenarios such as the Fully Unmatched Query (FUQ) condition, where only inactive sounds are specified in the query, and the Partially Matched Query (PMQ) condition, where both active and inactive sounds are specified. Among these conditions, the performance degradation under the PMQ condition has been largely overlooked. To achieve robust TSE under the PMQ condition, we propose context-aware query refinement. This method eliminates inactive classes from the query during inference based on the estimated sound class activity. Experimental results demonstrate that while conventional methods suffer from performance degradation under the PMQ condition, the proposed method effectively mitigates this degradation and achieves high robustness under diverse query conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Prior Prompt Engineering for Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14157v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates prior prompt engineering (pPE) in the context of reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where language models (LMs) are incentivized to exhibit behaviors that maximize performance through reward signals. While existing RFT research has primarily focused on algorithms, reward shaping, and data curation, the design of the prior prompt--the instructions prepended to queries during training to elicit behaviors such as step-by-step reasoning--remains underexplored. We investigate whether different pPE approaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT. Inspired by inference-time prompt engineering (iPE), we translate five representative iPE strategies--reasoning, planning, code-based reasoning, knowledge recall, and null-example utilization--into corresponding pPE approaches. We experiment with Qwen2.5-7B using each of the pPE approaches, then evaluate performance on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., AIME2024, HumanEval+, and GPQA-Diamond). Our results show that all pPE-trained models surpass their iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach achieving the largest average performance gain and the highest improvement on AIME2024 and GPQA-Diamond, surpassing the commonly used reasoning approach. Furthermore, by adapting a behavior-classification framework, we demonstrate that different pPE strategies instill distinct behavioral styles in the resulting models. These findings position pPE as a powerful yet understudied axis for RFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025, Main; 26 pages, 42 figures</p></details> |

We describe an extension of payment channels in the Proofgold network which allow the two parties to bet on whether a proposition will be proven by a certain time. These provide the foundation for a Proofgold lightning network that would allow parties to request proofs (by betting there will be no proof by a certain time) and other parties to provide proofs (and be rewarded by betting there will be a proof). The bets may also provide a way to approximate the probability that a certain proposition is provable (in the given amount of time). We describe the implementation of payment channels supporting proofs in Proofgold and discuss a potential lightning network that could be built as a result. One application of such lightning network would be a large decentralized infrastructure for fast collaborative formalization projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at BCCA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symmetry-Guided Multi-Agent Inverse Reinforcement Learnin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08257v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency. Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot systems has shown the practicality of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 6 figures.

| **[Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models with Forgetting-aware Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08255v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly, FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\% accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by emnlp2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional BFT consensus protocols, Ocior processes incoming transactions individually and concurrently using parallel instances of consensus. While leader-based consensus protocols rely on a designated leader to propose transactions, Ocior is a leaderless consensus protocol that guarantees stable liveness. Ocior achieves: 1) Optimal resilience: Ocior tolerates up to $t$ faulty nodes controlled by an adaptive adversary, for $n\geq 3t+1$. 2) Optimal communication complexity: The total expected communication per transaction is $O(n)$. 3) Optimal (or near-optimal) computation complexity: The total computation per transaction is $O(n)$ in the best case, or $O(n \log^2 n)$ in the worst case. 4) Optimal round complexity: A legitimate two-party transaction can be finalized with a good-case latency of two asynchronous rounds, for any $n\geq 3t+1$. The good case in terms of latency refers to the scenario where the transaction is proposed by any (not necessarily designated) honest node. A two-party transaction involves the transfer of digital assets from one user (or group of users) to one or more recipients. To support efficient consensus, we introduce a novel non-interactive threshold signature (TS) scheme called OciorBLSts. It offers fast signature aggregation, and is adaptively secure. OciorBLSts achieves a computation complexity of signature aggregation of only $O(n)$ in the good cases. Moreover, OciorBLSts supports the property of Instantaneous TS Aggregation. This enables real-time aggregation of partial signatures as they arrive, reducing waiting time and improving responsiveness.</p></details> | 52 pages |

However, as the number of frames increases, the memory consumption for training and inference increases substantially, posing challenges in resource-constrained scenarios. Inspired by the success of traditional video compression frameworks, which process video frame by frame and can efficiently compress long videos, we adopt this modeling strategy for INRs to decrease memory consumption, while aiming to unify the frameworks from the perspective of timeline-based autoregressive modeling. In this work, we present a novel understanding of INR models from an autoregressive (AR) perspective and introduce a Unified AutoRegressive Framework for memory-efficient Neural Video Compression (UAR-NVC). UAR-NVC integrates timeline-based and INR-based neural video compression under a unified autoregressive paradigm. It partitions videos into several clips and processes each clip using a different INR model instance, leveraging the advantages of both compression frameworks while allowing seamless adaptation to either in form. To further reduce temporal redundancy between clips, we design two modules to optimize the initialization, training, and compression of these model parameters. UAR-NVC supports adjustable latencies by varying the clip length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that UAR-NVC, with its flexible video clip setting, can adapt to resource-constrained environments and significantly improve performance compared to different baseline models.

Each robot maps its surroundings using SLAM and identifies a set of areas of interest (AoIs) or frontiers that are the most informative to explore next. The robots assess the utility of going to a frontier using Behavioral Entropy (BE) and then determine which frontier to go to via a distributed task assignment scheme. We convert the task assignment problem into a non-cooperative game and use a distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) to converge to the Nash equilibrium (which we show is the optimal task allocation solution). For unknown utility cases, we provide robust bounds using approximate rewards. We test our algorithm (which has less communication cost and fast convergence) in simulation, where we explore the effect of sensing radii, sensing accuracy, and heterogeneity among robotic teams with respect to the time taken to complete exploration and path traveled. We observe that having a team of agents with heterogeneous behaviors is beneficial.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

These data often exhibit inherent noise and complex relational structures, complicating conventional modeling and statistical inference. Motivated by empirical challenges in analyzing such data sets, this paper introduces a family of network subspace generalized linear models designed for analyzing noisy, network-linked data. We propose a model inference method based on subspace-constrained maximum likelihood, which emphasizes flexibility in capturing network effects and provides a robust inference framework against network perturbations. We establish the asymptotic distributions of the estimators under network perturbations, demonstrating the method's accuracy through extensive simulations involving random network models and deep-learning-based embedding algorithms.

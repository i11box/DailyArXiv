| **[HoloCine: Holistic Generation of Cinematic Multi-Shot Long Video Narratives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20822v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence, HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future.

| **[Language Models use Lookbacks to Track Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14685v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when those beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of understanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze LMs' ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal mediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset, CausalToM, consisting of simple stories where two characters independently change the state of two objects, potentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovers a pervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables the LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds each character-object-state triple together by co-locating their reference information, represented as Ordering IDs (OIs), in low-rank subspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's beliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the correct state OI and then the answer lookback retrieves the corresponding state token. When we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the other, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the relation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility lookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character and update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering ToM reasoning in LMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 33 figures.

| **[LayerComposer: Interactive Personalized T2I via Spatially-Aware Layered Canvas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20820v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation. Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.</p></details> | 9 pages, preprint |
| **[Real Deep Research for AI, Robotics and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20809v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over 10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends, uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>websi...</summary><p>website: https://realdeepresearch.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Video Prediction of Dynamic Physical Simulations With Pixel-Space Spatiotemporal Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20807v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models, and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[ARGenSeg: Image Segmentation with Autoregressive Image Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20803v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, 18 pages</p></details> |
| **[DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Simple Context Compression: Mean-Pooling and Multi-Ratio Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20797v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/lil-lab/simple-context-compression</p></details> |
| **[AI-Enabled Digital Twins for Next-Generation Networks: Forecasting Traffic and Resource Management in 5G/6G](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20796v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As 5G and future 6G mobile networks become increasingly more sophisticated, the requirements for agility, scalability, resilience, and precision in real-time service provisioning cannot be met using traditional and heuristic-based resource management techniques, just like any advancing technology. With the aim of overcoming such limitations, network operators are foreseeing Digital Twins (DTs) as key enablers, which are designed as dynamic and virtual replicas of network infrastructure, allowing operators to model, analyze, and optimize various operations without any risk of affecting the live network. However, for Digital Twin Networks (DTNs) to meet the challenges faced by operators especially in line with resource management, a driving engine is needed. In this paper, an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven approach is presented by integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network into the DT framework, aimed at forecasting network traffic patterns and proactively managing resource allocation. Through analytical experiments, the AI-Enabled DT framework demonstrates superior performance benchmarked against baseline methods. Our study concludes that embedding AI capabilities within DTs paves the way for fully autonomous, adaptive, and high-performance network management in future mobile networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 2 Tables, Accepted and to be presented at IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Inference of Primordial Magnetic Field Parameters from CMB with Spherical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20795v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Radar-Camera Fused Multi-Object Tracking: Online Calibration and Common Feature](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20794v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

| **[Text2Mem: A Unified Memory Operation Language for Memory Operating System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11145v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model agents increasingly depend on memory to sustain long horizon interaction, but existing frameworks remain limited. Most expose only a few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution, while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized foundation for memory control in agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Alleviating Forgetfulness of Linear Attention by Hybrid Sparse Attention and Contextualized Learnable Token Eviction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20787v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks. To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly, we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized \textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll (CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes \textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect \textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5, the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 1 figure, 12 tables</p></details> |

This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application (generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features), parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs, contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages with 3 figures, to appear in Proceedings of the 34th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '25)</p></details> |
| **[Are Large Reasoning Models Good Translation Evaluators? Analysis and Performance Boost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20780v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g., R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[CUPID: Pose-Grounded Generative 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20776v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space, Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery; and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3 dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity over baseline 3D generative models.

| **[CSU-PCAST: A Dual-Branch Transformer Framework for medium-range ensemble Precipitation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20769v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medium-range precipitation forecasting is crucial for hydrometeorological risk management and disaster mitigation, yet remains challenging for current numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Traditional ensemble systems such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) struggle to maintain high skill, especially for moderate and heavy rainfall at extended lead times. This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for multi-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at 0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including upper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin Transformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal continuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer normalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other variables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized training. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE), balancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the model ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to generate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG data demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance for moderate to heavy rainfall.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, submitted to arXiv under Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph) and Machine Learning (cs.LG)</p></details> |

Our strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization, split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings, including tabular, image, and genomic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 34 pages total (including checklist). 9 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Watermarking Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16349v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.

We train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches to modular exponentiation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th MATH-AI Workshop, NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

Yet most embeddings offer little control for adjusting a single musical attribute, e.g., changing only the mood of a track while preserving its genre or instrumentation. In this work, we address the problem of controllable music retrieval through embedding-based transformation, where the objective is to retrieve songs that remain similar to a seed track but are modified along one chosen dimension. We propose a novel framework for mood-guided music embedding transformation, which learns a mapping from a seed audio embedding to a target embedding guided by mood labels, while preserving other musical attributes. Because mood cannot be directly altered in the seed audio, we introduce a sampling mechanism that retrieves proxy targets to balance diversity with similarity to the seed. We train a lightweight translation model using this sampling strategy and introduce a novel joint objective that encourages transformation and information preservation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show strong mood transformation performance while retaining genre and instrumentation far better than training-free baselines, establishing controllable embedding transformation as a promising paradigm for personalized music retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review</p></details> |

This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

The lattice consists of integer coordinates called voxels. The voxelized vector field assigns a vector at each voxel. This data type encompasses images, tensors, and voxel data. Assume there is a nice energy function on the vector field. We consider the problem of lossy compression of voxelized vector field data in Shannon's rate-distortion framework. This means the data is compressed then decompressed up to a bound on the distortion of the energy at each voxel. We formulate this in terms of compressing a single voxelized vector field by a collection of box summary pairs. We call this problem the $(k,D)$-RectLossyVFCompression} problem. We show three main results about this problem. The first is that decompression for this problem is polynomial time tractable. This means that the only obstruction to a tractable solution of the $(k,D)$-RectLossyVFCompression problem lies in the compression stage. This is shown by the two hardness results about the compression stage. We show that the compression stage is NP-Hard to compute exactly and that it is even APX-Hard to approximate for $k,D\geq 2$. Assuming $P\neq NP$, this shows that when $k,D \geq 2$ there can be no exact polynomial time algorithm nor can there even be a PTAS approximation algorithm for the $(k,D)$-RectLossyVFCompression problem.</p></details> | 50 pages, 4 figures |
| **[DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | Preprint |

We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/lil-lab/simple-context-compression</p></details> |

This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Most expose only a few basic primitives such as encode, retrieve, and delete, while higher order operations like merge, promote, demote, split, lock, and expire are missing or inconsistently supported. Moreover, there is no formal and executable specification for memory commands, leaving scope and lifecycle rules implicit and causing unpredictable behavior across systems. We introduce Text2Mem, a unified memory operation language that provides a standardized pathway from natural language to reliable execution. Text2Mem defines a compact yet expressive operation set aligned with encoding, storage, and retrieval. Each instruction is represented as a JSON based schema instance with required fields and semantic invariants, which a parser transforms into typed operation objects with normalized parameters. A validator ensures correctness before execution, while adapters map typed objects either to a SQL prototype backend or to real memory frameworks. Model based services such as embeddings or summarization are integrated when required. All results are returned through a unified execution contract. This design ensures safety, determinism, and portability across heterogeneous backends. We also outline Text2Mem Bench, a planned benchmark that separates schema generation from backend execution to enable systematic evaluation. Together, these components establish the first standardized foundation for memory control in agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly, we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Tverberg-type problem of Kalai: Two negative answers to questions of Alon and Smorodinsky, and the power of disjointness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20770v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $f_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote the least integer $n$ such that every $n$-point set $P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ admits a partition $P=P_1\cup\cdots\cup P_r$ with the property that for any choice of $s_i$-convex sets $C_i\supseteq P_i$ $(i\in[r])$ one necessarily has $\bigcap_{i=1}^r C_i\neq\emptyset$, where an $s_i$-convex set means a union of $s_i$ convex sets. A recent breakthrough by Alon and Smorodinsky establishes a general upper bound $f_r(d,s_1,\dots,s_r) = O(dr^2\log r \prod_{i=1}^r s_i\cdot \log(\prod_{i=1}^r s_i).$ Specializing to $r=2$ resolves the problem of Kalai from the 1970s. They further singled out two particularly intriguing questions: whether $f_{2}(2,s,s)$ can be improved from $O(s^2\log s)$ to $O(s)$, and whether $f_r(d,s,\ldots,s)\le Poly(r,d,s)$. We answer both in the negative by showing the exponential lower bound $f_{r}(d,s,\ldots,s)> s^{r}$ for any $r\ge 2$, $s\ge 1$ and $d\ge 2r-2$, which matches the upper bound up to a multiplicative $\log{s}$ factor for sufficiently large $s$. Our construction combines a scalloped planar configuration with a direct product of regular $s$-gon on the high-dimensional torus $(\mathbb{S}^1)^{r-2}$. Perhaps surprisingly, if we additionally require that within each block the $s_i$ convex sets are pairwise disjoint, the picture changes markedly. Let $F_r(d,s_1,\ldots,s_r)$ denote this disjoint-union variant of the extremal function. We show: (1) $F_{2}(2,s,s)=O(s\log s)$ by performing controlled planar geometric transformations and constructing an auxiliary graph whose planarity yields the upper bound; (2) when $s$ is large, $F_r(d,s,\ldots,s)$ can be bounded by $O_{r,d}(s^{(1-\frac{1}{2^{d}(d+1)})r+1})$ and $O_{d}(r^{3}\log r\cdot s^{2d+3})$, respectively. This builds on a novel connection between the geometric obstruction and hypergraph Tur\'{a}n numbers, in particular, a variant of the Erd\H{o}s box problem.</p></details> | 26 pages, 13 figures |
| **[CSU-PCAST: A Dual-Branch Transformer Framework for medium-range ensemble Precipitation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20769v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medium-range precipitation forecasting is crucial for hydrometeorological risk management and disaster mitigation, yet remains challenging for current numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Traditional ensemble systems such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) struggle to maintain high skill, especially for moderate and heavy rainfall at extended lead times. This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for multi-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at 0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including upper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin Transformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal continuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer normalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other variables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized training. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE), balancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the model ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to generate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG data demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance for moderate to heavy rainfall.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, submitted to arXiv under Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph) and Machine Learning (cs.LG)</p></details> |

Our strategy builds on foundational results from nonparametric statistics and spectral graph theory to learn a low-dimensional embedding of the model that optimally represents relationships in the data. We provide exact and approximate solutions to the decoding problem via constrained optimization, split relabeling, and nearest neighbors regression. These methods effectively invert the compression pipeline, establishing a map from the embedding space back to the input space using splits learned by the ensemble's constituent trees. The resulting decoders are universally consistent under common regularity assumptions. The procedure works with supervised or unsupervised models, providing a window into conditional or joint distributions. We demonstrate various applications of this autoencoder, including powerful new tools for visualization, compression, clustering, and denoising. Experiments illustrate the ease and utility of our method in a wide range of settings, including tabular, image, and genomic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages main text, 34 pages total (including checklist). 9 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Watermarking Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16349v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking the outputs of generative models has emerged as a promising approach for tracking their provenance. Despite significant interest in autoregressive image generation models and their potential for misuse, no prior work has attempted to watermark their outputs at the token level. In this work, we present the first such approach by adapting language model watermarking techniques to this setting. We identify a key challenge: the lack of reverse cycle-consistency (RCC), wherein re-tokenizing generated image tokens significantly alters the token sequence, effectively erasing the watermark. To address this and to make our method robust to common image transformations, neural compression, and removal attacks, we introduce (i) a custom tokenizer-detokenizer finetuning procedure that improves RCC, and (ii) a complementary watermark synchronization layer. As our experiments demonstrate, our approach enables reliable and robust watermark detection with theoretically grounded p-values.

We train a 4-layer encoder-decoder Transformer model to perform this operation and investigate the emergence of numerical reasoning during training. Utilizing principled sampling strategies, PCA-based embedding analysis, and activation patching, we examine how number-theoretic properties are encoded within the model. We find that reciprocal operand training leads to strong performance gains, with sudden generalization across related moduli. These synchronized accuracy surges reflect grokking-like dynamics, suggesting the model internalizes shared arithmetic structure. We also find a subgraph consisting entirely of attention heads in the final layer sufficient to achieve full performance on the task of regular exponentiation. These results suggest that transformer models learn modular arithmetic through specialized computational circuits, paving the way for more interpretable and efficient neural approaches to modular exponentiation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 5th MATH-AI Workshop, NeurIPS'25</p></details> |

Yet most embeddings offer little control for adjusting a single musical attribute, e.g., changing only the mood of a track while preserving its genre or instrumentation. In this work, we address the problem of controllable music retrieval through embedding-based transformation, where the objective is to retrieve songs that remain similar to a seed track but are modified along one chosen dimension. We propose a novel framework for mood-guided music embedding transformation, which learns a mapping from a seed audio embedding to a target embedding guided by mood labels, while preserving other musical attributes. Because mood cannot be directly altered in the seed audio, we introduce a sampling mechanism that retrieves proxy targets to balance diversity with similarity to the seed. We train a lightweight translation model using this sampling strategy and introduce a novel joint objective that encourages transformation and information preservation. Extensive experiments on two datasets show strong mood transformation performance while retaining genre and instrumentation far better than training-free baselines, establishing controllable embedding transformation as a promising paradigm for personalized music retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; under review</p></details> |

In this work, we present the first implementation of recompression RLSLP construction that runs in compressed time, operating on an LZ77-like approximation of the input. Compared to state-of-the-art uncompressed-time methods, our approach achieves up to $46\times$ speedup and $17\times$ lower RAM usage on large, repetitive inputs.

Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work of academic research, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.</p></details> | 24 pages, 15 figures |

While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV} consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains.

However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025, San Diego, California, USA</p></details> |

However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

We show that H-SPLID promotes learning low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient features, such as image backgrounds.

Conventional convolutional operations are fundamentally limited by their linear nature along with fixed activations, where many layers are needed to learn meaningful patterns in data. Because of the sheer size of these networks, this approach is simply computationally inefficient, and poses overfitting or gradient explosion risks, especially in small datasets. As a result, we introduce a "plug-in" module, called Residual Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (RKAN). Our module is highly compact, so it can be easily added into any stage (level) of traditional deep networks, where it learns to integrate supportive polynomial feature transformations to existing convolutional frameworks. RKAN offers consistent improvements over baseline models in different vision tasks and widely tested benchmarks, accomplishing cutting-edge performance on them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/withray/residualKAN.git</p></details> |

This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |

While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

While effective, rewiring inherently alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

| **[Balanced Token Pruning: Accelerating Vision Language Models Beyond Local Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22038v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across multi-modal tasks by encoding images into thousands of tokens. However, the large number of image tokens results in significant computational overhead, and the use of dynamic high-resolution inputs further increases this burden. Previous approaches have attempted to reduce the number of image tokens through token pruning, typically by selecting tokens based on attention scores or image token diversity. Through empirical studies, we observe that existing methods often overlook the joint impact of pruning on both the current layer's output (local) and the outputs of subsequent layers (global), leading to suboptimal pruning decisions. To address this challenge, we propose Balanced Token Pruning (BTP), a plug-and-play method for pruning vision tokens. Specifically, our method utilizes a small calibration set to divide the pruning process into multiple stages. In the early stages, our method emphasizes the impact of pruning on subsequent layers, whereas in the deeper stages, the focus shifts toward preserving the consistency of local outputs. Extensive experiments across various LVLMs demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves a 78% compression rate while preserving 96.7% of the original models' performance on average.

This imbalance leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework. Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model. Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact events.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[LeVo: High-Quality Song Generation with Multi-Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07520v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to limitations in audio quality, musicality, instruction following, and vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, a language model based framework consisting of LeLM and Music Codec. LeLM is capable of parallel modeling of two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve better vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following ability, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo significantly outperforms existing open-source methods in both objective and subjective metrics, while performing competitively with industry systems. Ablation studies further justify the effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples and source code are available at https://levo-demo.github.io and https://github.com/tencent-ailab/songgeneration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11100v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i) Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features, thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items, yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%. Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear on NeurIPS 2025 (spotlight)</p></details> |

This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding.

While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities.

While initial works primarily incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify MoE designs in attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention mechanism, that reveals an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules. Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between FFN and attention components.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

However, the increasing size of Mamba models continues to pose challenges for training and deployment, particularly due to their substantial computational demands during both training and inference. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed to enable more efficient large language models (LLMs), with model sizes of 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B parameters. $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ models are trained from scratch on a standard LLM-scale dataset using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ achieves performance comparable to its full-precision (FP16 or BF16) counterparts, while outperforming post-training binarization (PTB) Mamba and binarization-aware training (BAT) Transformer baselines. Moreover, $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ drastically reduces memory usage and computational cost compared to the original Mamba. Our work pioneers a new line of linear-complexity LLMs under low-bit representation and provides the way for the design of specialized hardware optimized for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based models.

However, current approaches remain limited to synthesizing motion from short or general text prompts, primarily due to dataset constraints. This limitation undermines fine-grained controllability and generalization to unseen prompts. In this paper, we introduce SnapMoGen, a new text-motion dataset featuring high-quality motion capture data paired with accurate, expressive textual annotations. The dataset comprises 20K motion clips totaling 44 hours, accompanied by 122K detailed textual descriptions averaging 48 words per description (vs. 12 words of HumanML3D). Importantly, these motion clips preserve original temporal continuity as they were in long sequences, facilitating research in long-term motion generation and blending. We also improve upon previous generative masked modeling approaches. Our model, MoMask++, transforms motion into multi-scale token sequences that better exploit the token capacity, and learns to generate all tokens using a single generative masked transformer. MoMask++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HumanML3D and SnapMoGen benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to process casual user prompts by employing an LLM to reformat inputs to align with the expressivity and narration style of SnapMoGen.

Using Mamba, MLMA implicitly incorporates language-aware conditioning and shared representations to support robust recognition across diverse languages. Experiments on standard multilingual benchmarks show that MLMA achieves competitive performance compared to Transformer-based architectures.

By representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

While the vanilla version of ALCC is known to preserve the privacy of the datasets from the workers and also achieve resilience against stragglers, it is not robust against Byzantine workers that return erroneous results. Highlighting this vulnerability, we propose a secure ALCC framework that is resilient against a wide range of integrity threats from the Byzantine workers. As a foundational step, we use error-correction algorithms for Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codes to build novel reconstruction strategies for ALCC thereby improving its computational accuracy in the presence of a bounded number of Byzantine workers. Furthermore, capitalizing on some theoretical results on the performance of the DFT decoders, we propose novel strategies for distributing the ALCC computational tasks to the workers, and show that such methods significantly improve the accuracy when the workers' trust profiles are available at the master server. Finally, we study the robustness of the proposed framework against colluding attacks, and show that interesting attack strategies can be executed by exploiting the inherent precision noise owing to floating point implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages.

However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender, age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical problem design and data collection.

On the Effect of Pretraining on Architectural Abilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21785v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have theoretical limitations in modeling certain sequence-to-sequence tasks, yet it remains largely unclear if these limitations play a role in large-scale pretrained LLMs, or whether LLMs might effectively overcome these constraints in practice due to the scale of both the models themselves and their pretraining data. We explore how these architectural constraints manifest after pretraining, by studying a family of $\textit{retrieval}$ and $\textit{copying}$ tasks inspired by Liu et al. [2024a]. We use a recently proposed framework for studying length generalization [Huang et al., 2025] to provide guarantees for each of our settings. Empirically, we observe an $\textit{induction-versus-anti-induction}$ asymmetry, where pretrained models are better at retrieving tokens to the right (induction) rather than the left (anti-induction) of a query token. This asymmetry disappears upon targeted fine-tuning if length-generalization is guaranteed by theory. Mechanistic analysis reveals that this asymmetry is connected to the differences in the strength of induction versus anti-induction circuits within pretrained transformers. We validate our findings through practical experiments on real-world tasks demonstrating reliability risks. Our results highlight that pretraining selectively enhances certain transformer capabilities, but does not overcome fundamental length-generalization limits.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Scaling them to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only 10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at: \url{https://github.com/Zhoutong-Wu/SkipV1Former}</p></details> |

We argue this stems from two key limitations: the lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Prior works integrating image segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, 18 pages</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Inference of Primordial Magnetic Field Parameters from CMB with Spherical Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20795v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space, Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery; and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3 dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity over baseline 3D generative models.

Traditional ensemble systems such as the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) struggle to maintain high skill, especially for moderate and heavy rainfall at extended lead times. This study develops a deep learning-based ensemble framework for multi-step precipitation prediction through joint modeling of a comprehensive set of atmospheric variables. The model is trained on ERA5 reanalysis data at 0.25$^{\circ}$ spatial resolution, with precipitation labels from NASA's Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation (IMERG), incorporating 57 input variables, including upper-air and surface predictors. The architecture employs a patch-based Swin Transformer backbone with periodic convolutions to handle longitudinal continuity and integrates time and noise embeddings through conditional layer normalization. A dual-branch decoder predicts total precipitation and other variables, with targeted freezing of encoder-decoder pathways for specialized training. Training minimizes a hybrid loss combining the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) and weighted log1p mean squared error (log1pMSE), balancing probabilistic accuracy and magnitude fidelity. During inference, the model ingests real-time Global Forecast System (GFS) initial conditions to generate 15-day forecasts autoregressively. Evaluation against GEFS using IMERG data demonstrates higher Critical Success Index (CSI) scores at precipitation thresholds of 0.1 mm, 1 mm, 10 mm, and 20 mm, highlighting improved performance for moderate to heavy rainfall.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, submitted to arXiv under Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph) and Machine Learning (cs.LG)</p></details> |

While theoretical advances have led to highly efficient index structures, their practical construction remains a bottleneck, especially for complex components like recompression RLSLP, a grammar-based representation crucial for building powerful text indexes that support widely used suffix and LCP array queries. In this work, we present the first implementation of recompression RLSLP construction that runs in compressed time, operating on an LZ77-like approximation of the input. Compared to state-of-the-art uncompressed-time methods, our approach achieves up to $46\times$ speedup and $17\times$ lower RAM usage on large, repetitive inputs. These gains unlock scalability to larger datasets and affirm compressed computation as a practical path forward for fast index construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ALENEX 2026</p></details> |
| **[Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache Compression in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20707v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV} consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains.

The goal of neurosymbolic learning is to train the neural networks using end-to-end input-output labels of the composite. We introduce CTSketch, a novel, scalable neurosymbolic learning algorithm. CTSketch uses two techniques to improve the scalability of neurosymbolic inference: decompose the symbolic program into sub-programs and summarize each sub-program with a sketched tensor. This strategy allows us to approximate the output distribution of the program with simple tensor operations over the input distributions and the sketches. We provide theoretical insight into the maximum approximation error. Furthermore, we evaluate CTSketch on benchmarks from the neurosymbolic learning literature, including some designed for evaluating scalability. Our results show that CTSketch pushes neurosymbolic learning to new scales that were previously unattainable, with neural predictors obtaining high accuracy on tasks with one thousand inputs, despite supervision only on the final output.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations (e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing. R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both clean and noisy conditions.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese, we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models: a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.</p></details> | 13 pages, 1 figure |

Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects. Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to ICASSPW 2026</p></details> |

However, performing these computations directly in the physical space often incurs significant computational costs. To address this issue, several neural surrogate models have been developed that operate in a compressed latent space to solve the PDE. While these approaches reduce computational complexity, they often use Transformer-based attention mechanisms to handle irregularly sampled domains, resulting in increased memory consumption. In contrast, convolutional neural networks allow memory-efficient encoding and decoding but are limited to regular discretizations. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CALM-PDE, a model class that efficiently solves arbitrarily discretized PDEs in a compressed latent space. We introduce a novel continuous convolution-based encoder-decoder architecture that uses an epsilon-neighborhood-constrained kernel and learns to apply the convolution operator to adaptive and optimized query points. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CALM-PDE on a diverse set of PDEs with both regularly and irregularly sampled spatial domains. CALM-PDE is competitive with or outperforms existing baseline methods while offering significant improvements in memory and inference time efficiency compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2025, San Diego, California, USA</p></details> |
| **[How Quickly Do Development Teams Update Their Vulnerable Dependencies?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industry practitioners are increasingly concerned with software that contains vulnerable versions of third-party dependencies that are included both directly and transitively. To address this problem, projects are encouraged to both (a)~quickly update to non-vulnerable versions of dependencies and (b)~be mindful of the update practices of the dependencies they choose to use. To this end, researchers have proposed metrics to measure the responsiveness of the development teams of the packages in keeping their dependencies updated: Mean-Time-To-Update (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate (MTTR). While MTTU covers all dependencies, MTTR quantifies the time needed for a package to update its vulnerable dependencies. However, existing metrics fail to capture important nuances, such as considering floating versions and prioritizing recent updates, leading to inaccurate reflections of a development team's update practices. \textit{The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in understanding how quickly packages update their dependencies.} We propose two novel metrics, Mean-Time-To-Update for dependencies (MTTU) and Mean-Time-To-Remediate for vulnerable dependencies (MTTR), that overcome the limitations of existing metrics. We conduct an empirical study using $163,207$ packages in npm ($117,129$), PyPI ($42,777$), and Cargo ($3,301$) and characterize how the ecosystems differ in MTTU and MTTR, as well as what package characteristics influence MTTU and MTTR. We found that most packages have a relatively fast dependency update practice. We further study whether MTTU can be used as a proxy for MTTR when sufficient vulnerability data is not available. As we did not find enough statistical evidence for a strong proxy, our findings suggest that MTTU could only be partially used (may be used but with caution) as a proxy for MTTR when vulnerability data is not available.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Better Tokens for Better 3D: Advancing Vision-Language Modeling in 3D Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20639v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned 3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact, frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

These approaches help offset limitations stemming from the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and under-representation of information required at deployment time among other limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate this "consortium consistency" approach across many model teams from a pool of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant drawback with single-model consistency methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 workshop on Reliable ML from Unreliable Data</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the inner mechanisms of safety alignment through the lens of mechanistic interpretability, focusing on identifying and analyzing safety neurons within LLMs that are responsible for safety behaviors. We propose inference-time activation contrasting to locate these neurons and dynamic activation patching to evaluate their causal effects on model safety. Experiments on multiple prevalent LLMs demonstrate that we can consistently identify about $5\%$ safety neurons, and by only patching their activations we can restore over $90\%$ of the safety performance across various red-teaming benchmarks without influencing general ability. The finding of safety neurons also helps explain the ''alignment tax'' phenomenon by revealing that the key neurons for model safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, yet they require different activation patterns for the same neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of our findings in safeguarding LLMs by detecting unsafe outputs before generation.

| **[MS-BART: Unified Modeling of Mass Spectra and Molecules for Structure Elucidation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20615v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification, significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra. While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, We provide the data and code at https://github.com/OpenDFM/MS-BART</p></details> |
| **[Neural Attention Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13251v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Neural Attention Search (NAtS), a framework that automatically evaluates the importance of each token within a sequence and determines if the corresponding token can be dropped after several steps. This approach can efficiently reduce the KV cache sizes required by transformer-based models during inference and thus reduce inference costs. In this paper, we design a search space that contains three token types: (i) Global Tokens will be preserved and queried by all the following tokens. (ii) Local Tokens survive until the next global token appears. (iii) Sliding Window Tokens have an impact on the inference of a fixed size of the next following tokens. Similar to the One-Shot Neural Architecture Search approach, this token-type information can be learned jointly with the architecture weights via a learnable attention mask. Experiments on both training a new transformer from scratch and fine-tuning existing large language models show that NAtS can efficiently reduce the KV cache size required for the models while maintaining the models' performance.</p></details> | 35 pages, 11 figures |

While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail.

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging competitive programming and data science tasks.

These issues lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color, which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional image enhancement modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages.

| **[Benchmarking World-Model Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19788v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in world-model learning.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11100v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i) Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features, thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items, yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for modeling sequential and set-wise contexts. First, we align sequence side features with non-sequential features for accurate sequence modeling and fine-grained interest representation. Second, we shift the prediction paradigm from point-wise to set-wise, facilitating cross-item interaction in a highly parallel manner. Third, HoMer's unified encoder-decoder architecture achieves dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation, ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the AUC metric, and enhances online business metrics like CTR/RPM by 1.99%/2.46%. Additionally, HoMer saves 27% of GPU resources via preliminary engineering optimization, further validating its superiority and practicality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235v5)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding.

| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Task Offloading in Wireless Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01257v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral presentation at AI4NextG @ NeurIPS'25 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Train with Perturbation, Infer after Merging: A Two-Stage Framework for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22389v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable models to continuously acquire new knowledge from a sequence of tasks with avoiding the forgetting of learned information. However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\&M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\&M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, We minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive a closed-form solution for the merging coefficient under mild assumptions. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\&M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several continual learning benchmark datasets.

| **[Shallow Flow Matching for Coarse-to-Fine Text-to-Speech Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12226v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Shallow Flow Matching (SFM), a novel mechanism that enhances flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Unlike conventional FM modules, which use the coarse representations from the weak generator as conditions, SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths from these representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise, thereby focusing computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments demonstrate that SFM yields consistent gains in speech naturalness across both objective and subjective evaluations, and significantly accelerates inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers. Demo and codes are available at https://ydqmkkx.github.io/SFMDemo/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[SPLite Hand: Sparsity-Aware Lightweight 3D Hand Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16396v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AICCC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bi-Mamba: Towards Accurate 1-Bit State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11843v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The typical Selective State-Space Model (SSM) used in Mamba addresses several limitations of Transformers, such as the quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length and the significant memory requirements during inference due to the key-value (KV) cache. However, the increasing size of Mamba models continues to pose challenges for training and deployment, particularly due to their substantial computational demands during both training and inference. In this work, we introduce $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$, a scalable and powerful 1-bit Mamba architecture designed to enable more efficient large language models (LLMs), with model sizes of 780M, 1.3B, and 2.7B parameters. $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ models are trained from scratch on a standard LLM-scale dataset using an autoregressive distillation loss. Extensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ achieves performance comparable to its full-precision (FP16 or BF16) counterparts, while outperforming post-training binarization (PTB) Mamba and binarization-aware training (BAT) Transformer baselines. Moreover, $\texttt{Bi-Mamba}$ drastically reduces memory usage and computational cost compared to the original Mamba. Our work pioneers a new line of linear-complexity LLMs under low-bit representation and provides the way for the design of specialized hardware optimized for efficient 1-bit Mamba-based models. Code and the pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/Tangshengku/Bi-Mamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in TMLR 2025</p></details> |

Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Cache Methods in Diffusion Models: Toward Efficient Multi-Modal Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19755v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent \textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation. Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its classification and analysis. Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of \textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.</p></details> | 22 pages,2 figures |
| **[Ask a Strong LLM Judge when Your Reward Model is Uncertain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20369v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its effectiveness in improving online RLHF.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, 18 pages</p></details> |

In this article, we address the gap in robust Vietnamese NLI resources by introducing ViANLI, the first adversarial NLI dataset for Vietnamese, and propose NLIMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts model to tackle its complexity. We construct ViANLI using an adversarial human-and-machine-in-the-loop approach with rigorous verification. NLIMoE integrates expert subnetworks with a learned dynamic routing mechanism on top of a shared transformer encoder. ViANLI comprises over 10,000 premise-hypothesis pairs and challenges state-of-the-art models, with XLM-R Large achieving only 45.5% accuracy, while NLIMoE reaches 47.3%. Training with ViANLI improves performance on other benchmark Vietnamese NLI datasets including ViNLI, VLSP2021-NLI, and VnNewsNLI. ViANLI is released for enhancing research into model robustness and enriching resources for future Vietnamese and multilingual NLI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |

We introduce Online Audio-Visual Event Parsing (On-AVEP), a novel paradigm for parsing audio, visual, and audio-visual events by sequentially analyzing incoming video streams. The On-AVEP task necessitates models with two key capabilities: (1) Accurate online inference, to effectively distinguish events with unclear and limited context in online settings, and (2) Real-time efficiency, to balance high performance with computational constraints. To cultivate these, we propose the Predictive Future Modeling (PreFM) framework featured by (a) predictive multimodal future modeling to infer and integrate beneficial future audio-visual cues, thereby enhancing contextual understanding and (b) modality-agnostic robust representation along with focal temporal prioritization to improve precision and generalization. Extensive experiments on the UnAV-100 and LLP datasets show PreFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with significantly fewer parameters, offering an insightful approach for real-time multimodal video understanding.

| **[Mobile-MMLU: A Mobile Intelligence Language Understanding Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20786v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have increased interest in deploying them on mobile devices for on-device AI applications. Mobile users interact differently with LLMs compared to desktop users, creating unique expectations and data biases. Current benchmark datasets primarily target at server and desktop environments, and there is a notable lack of extensive datasets specifically designed for mobile contexts. Additionally, mobile devices face strict limitations in storage and computing resources, constraining model size and capabilities, thus requiring optimized efficiency and prioritized knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-MMLU, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for mobile intelligence. It consists of 16,186 questions across 80 mobile-related fields, designed to evaluate LLM performance in realistic mobile scenarios. A challenging subset, Mobile-MMLU-Pro, provides advanced evaluation similar in size to MMLU-Pro but significantly more difficult than our standard full set. Both benchmarks use multiple-choice, order-invariant questions focused on practical mobile interactions, such as recipe suggestions, travel planning, and essential daily tasks. The dataset emphasizes critical mobile-specific metrics like inference latency, energy consumption, memory usage, and response quality, offering comprehensive insights into model performance under mobile constraints. Moreover, it prioritizes privacy and adaptability, assessing models' ability to perform on-device processing, maintain user privacy, and adapt to personalized usage patterns. Mobile-MMLU family offers a standardized framework for developing and comparing mobile-optimized LLMs, enabling advancements in productivity and decision-making within mobile computing environments.

| **[Free4D: Tuning-free 4D Scene Generation with Spatial-Temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20785v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Free4D, a novel tuning-free framework for 4D scene generation from a single image. Existing methods either focus on object-level generation, making scene-level generation infeasible, or rely on large-scale multi-view video datasets for expensive training, with limited generalization ability due to the scarcity of 4D scene data. In contrast, our key insight is to distill pre-trained foundation models for consistent 4D scene representation, which offers promising advantages such as efficiency and generalizability. 1) To achieve this, we first animate the input image using image-to-video diffusion models followed by 4D geometric structure initialization. 2) To turn this coarse structure into spatial-temporal consistent multiview videos, we design an adaptive guidance mechanism with a point-guided denoising strategy for spatial consistency and a novel latent replacement strategy for temporal coherence. 3) To lift these generated observations into consistent 4D representation, we propose a modulation-based refinement to mitigate inconsistencies while fully leveraging the generated information. The resulting 4D representation enables real-time, controllable rendering, marking a significant advancement in single-image-based 4D scene generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://free4d.github.io/ , Code: https://github.com/TQTQliu/Free4D</p></details> |
| **[FB-4D: Spatial-Temporal Coherent Dynamic 3D Content Generation with Feature Banks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20784v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in diffusion models and 3D generation techniques, dynamic 3D content generation has become a crucial research area. However, achieving high-fidelity 4D (dynamic 3D) generation with strong spatial-temporal consistency remains a challenging task. Inspired by recent findings that pretrained diffusion features capture rich correspondences, we propose FB-4D, a novel 4D generation framework that integrates a Feature Bank mechanism to enhance both spatial and temporal consistency in generated frames. In FB-4D, we store features extracted from previous frames and fuse them into the process of generating subsequent frames, ensuring consistent characteristics across both time and multiple views. To ensure a compact representation, the Feature Bank is updated by a proposed dynamic merging mechanism. Leveraging this Feature Bank, we demonstrate for the first time that generating additional reference sequences through multiple autoregressive iterations can continuously improve generation performance. Experimental results show that FB-4D significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of rendering quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and robustness. It surpasses all multi-view generation tuning-free approaches by a large margin and achieves performance on par with training-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page:https://fb-4d.c7w.tech/</p></details> |
| **[PhysAnimator: Physics-Guided Generative Cartoon Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16550v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating hand-drawn animation sequences is labor-intensive and demands professional expertise. We introduce PhysAnimator, a novel approach for generating physically plausible meanwhile anime-stylized animation from static anime illustrations. Our method seamlessly integrates physics-based simulations with data-driven generative models to produce dynamic and visually compelling animations. To capture the fluidity and exaggeration characteristic of anime, we perform image-space deformable body simulations on extracted mesh geometries. We enhance artistic control by introducing customizable energy strokes and incorporating rigging point support, enabling the creation of tailored animation effects such as wind interactions. Finally, we extract and warp sketches from the simulation sequence, generating a texture-agnostic representation, and employ a sketch-guided video diffusion model to synthesize high-quality animation frames. The resulting animations exhibit temporal consistency and visual plausibility, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating dynamic anime-style animations.

| **[Zero-Shot Audio-Visual Editing via Cross-Modal Delta Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20782v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce zero-shot audio-video editing, a novel task that requires transforming original audio-visual content to align with a specified textual prompt without additional model training. To evaluate this task, we curate a benchmark dataset, AvED-Bench, designed explicitly for zero-shot audio-video editing. AvED-Bench includes 110 videos, each with a 10-second duration, spanning 11 categories from VGGSound. It offers diverse prompts and scenarios that require precise alignment between auditory and visual elements, enabling robust evaluation. We identify limitations in existing zero-shot audio and video editing methods, particularly in synchronization and coherence between modalities, which often result in inconsistent outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose AvED, a zero-shot cross-modal delta denoising framework that leverages audio-video interactions to achieve synchronized and coherent edits. AvED demonstrates superior results on both AvED-Bench and the recent OAVE dataset to validate its generalization capabilities. Results are available at https://genjib.github.io/project_page/AVED/index.html</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://genjib.github.io/project_page/AVED/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Reliable algorithm selection for machine learning-guided design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20767v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithms for machine learning-guided design, or design algorithms, use machine learning-based predictions to propose novel objects with desired property values. Given a new design task -- for example, to design novel proteins with high binding affinity to a therapeutic target -- one must choose a design algorithm and specify any hyperparameters and predictive and/or generative models involved. How can these decisions be made such that the resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design algorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion -- for example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold. It does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from prediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data distributions are known. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated protein and RNA design tasks, in settings with either known or estimated density ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[ASGO: Adaptive Structured Gradient Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20762v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is a structured optimization problem, because the parameters are naturally represented by matrices and tensors rather than simple vectors. Under this structural representation, it has been widely observed that gradients are low-rank and Hessians are approximately block-wise diagonal. These structured properties are crucial for designing efficient optimization algorithms but may not be utilized by current popular optimizers like Adam. In this paper, we present a novel optimization algorithm ASGO that capitalizes on these properties by employing a preconditioner that is adaptively updated using structured gradients. By fine-grained theoretical analysis, ASGO is proven to achieve superior convergence rates compared to existing structured gradient methods. Based on the convergence theory, we further demonstrate that ASGO can benefit from the low-rank and block-wise diagonal properties. We also discuss practical modifications of ASGO and empirically verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on language model tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>97 pa...</summary><p>97 pages, 20 tables, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[ADS-Edit: A Multimodal Knowledge Editing Dataset for Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20756v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

| **[Flying Vines: Design, Modeling, and Control of a Soft Aerial Robotic Arm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20754v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial robotic arms aim to enable inspection and environment interaction in otherwise hard-to-reach areas from the air. However, many aerial manipulators feature bulky or heavy robot manipulators mounted to large, high-payload aerial vehicles. Instead, we propose an aerial robotic arm with low mass and a small stowed configuration called a "flying vine". The flying vine consists of a small, maneuverable quadrotor equipped with a soft, growing, inflated beam as the arm. This soft robot arm is underactuated, and positioning of the end effector is achieved by controlling the coupled quadrotor-vine dynamics. In this work, we present the flying vine design and a modeling and control framework for tracking desired end effector trajectories. The dynamic model leverages data-driven modeling methods and introduces bilinear interpolation to account for time-varying dynamic parameters. We use trajectory optimization to plan quadrotor controls that produce desired end effector motions. Experimental results on a physical prototype demonstrate that our framework enables the flying vine to perform high-speed end effector tracking, laying a foundation for performing dynamic maneuvers with soft aerial manipulators.</p></details> | Submitted to RA-L |
| **[Reason-RFT: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20752v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning abilities play a crucial role in understanding complex multimodal data, advancing both domain-specific applications and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Existing methods improve VLM reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning, using meticulously annotated training data to enhance visual reasoning capabilities. However, this training paradigm may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, restricting the model's ability to transfer visual reasoning skills across domains and limiting its real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning framework that significantly enhances generalization capabilities in visual reasoning tasks. Reason-RFT introduces a two-phase training framework for visual reasoning: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data activates the reasoning potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), followed by (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning that generates multiple reasoning-response pairs, significantly enhancing generalization in visual reasoning tasks. To evaluate Reason-RFT's visual reasoning capabilities, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset spanning visual counting, structure perception, and spatial transformation.cExperimental results demonstrate Reasoning-RFT's three key advantages: (1) Performance Enhancement: achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks, outperforming most mainstream open-source and proprietary models; (2) Generalization Superiority: consistently maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks and domains, outperforming alternative training paradigms; (3) Data Efficiency: excelling in few-shot learning scenarios while surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines.</p></details> | 35 pages, 22 figures |
| **[UniSTD: Towards Unified Spatio-Temporal Learning across Diverse Disciplines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20748v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional spatiotemporal models generally rely on task-specific architectures, which limit their generalizability and scalability across diverse tasks due to domain-specific design requirements. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{UniSTD}, a unified Transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal modeling, which is inspired by advances in recent foundation models with the two-stage pretraining-then-adaption paradigm. Specifically, our work demonstrates that task-agnostic pretraining on 2D vision and vision-text datasets can build a generalizable model foundation for spatiotemporal learning, followed by specialized joint training on spatiotemporal datasets to enhance task-specific adaptability. To improve the learning capabilities across domains, our framework employs a rank-adaptive mixture-of-expert adaptation by using fractional interpolation to relax the discrete variables so that can be optimized in the continuous space. Additionally, we introduce a temporal module to incorporate temporal dynamics explicitly. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset covering 10 tasks across 4 disciplines, demonstrating that a unified spatiotemporal model can achieve scalable, cross-task learning and support up to 10 tasks simultaneously within one model while reducing training costs in multi-domain applications. Code will be available at https://github.com/1hunters/UniSTD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce PhysGen3D, a novel framework that transforms a single image into an amodal, camera-centric, interactive 3D scene. By combining advanced image-based geometric and semantic understanding with physics-based simulation, PhysGen3D creates an interactive 3D world from a static image, enabling us to "imagine" and simulate future scenarios based on user input. At its core, PhysGen3D estimates 3D shapes, poses, physical and lighting properties of objects, thereby capturing essential physical attributes that drive realistic object interactions. This framework allows users to specify precise initial conditions, such as object speed or material properties, for enhanced control over generated video outcomes. We evaluate PhysGen3D's performance against closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) image-to-video models, including Pika, Kling, and Gen-3, showing PhysGen3D's capacity to generate videos with realistic physics while offering greater flexibility and fine-grained control. Our results show that PhysGen3D achieves a unique balance of photorealism, physical plausibility, and user-driven interactivity, opening new possibilities for generating dynamic, physics-grounded video from an image.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page: https://by-luckk.github.io/PhysGen3D</p></details> |

However, these methods require substantial training time. In this paper, we introduce RecTable, which uses the rectified flow modeling, applied in such as text-to-image generation and text-to-video generation. RecTable features a simple architecture consisting of a few stacked gated linear unit blocks. Additionally, our training strategies are also simple, incorporating a mixed-type noise distribution and a logit-normal timestep distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that RecTable achieves competitive performance compared to the several state-of-the-art diffusion and score-based models while reducing the required training time.

However, performance is typically evaluated based on multiple parameters and few datasets, creating challenges in assessing which method is best for aligning data at scale. Here, we introduce the K-Neighbors Intersection (KNI) score, a single score that both penalizes batch effects and measures accuracy at cross-dataset cell-type label prediction alongside carefully curated small (scMARK) and large (scREF) benchmarks comprising 11 and 46 human scRNA studies respectively, where we have standardized author labels. Using the KNI score, we evaluate and optimize approaches for cross-dataset single-cell RNA integration. We introduce Batch Adversarial single-cell Variational Inference (BA-scVI), as a new variant of scVI that uses adversarial training to penalize batch-effects in the encoder and decoder, and show this approach outperforms other methods. In the resulting aligned space, we find that the granularity of cell-type groupings is conserved, supporting the notion that whole-organism cell-type maps can be created by a single model without loss of information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 LMRL workshop (International Conference on Learning Representations, Learning Meaningful Representations of Life Workshop)</p></details> |
| **[Analytic Models for the Capacity Distribution in MDG-impaired Optical SDM Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12487v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In coupled space-division multiplexing (SDM) transmission systems, imperfections in optical amplifiers and passive devices introduce mode-dependent loss (MDL) and gain (MDG). These effects render the channel capacity stochastic and result in a decrease in average capacity. Several previous studies employ multi-section simulations to model the capacity of these systems. Additionally, relevant works derive analytically the capacity distribution for a single-mode system with polarization-dependent gain and loss (mode count D = 2). However, to the best of our knowledge, analytic expressions of the capacity distribution for systems with D > 2 have not been presented. In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the capacity of optical systems with arbitrary mode counts. The expressions rely on Gaussian approximations for the per-mode capacity distributions and for the overall capacity distribution, as well as on fitting parameters for the capacity cross-correlation among different modes. Compared to simulations, the derived analytical expressions exhibit a suitable level of accuracy across a wide range of practical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appro...</summary><p>Approved for publication in Journal of Lightwave Technology</p></details> |
| **[Certified Robustness via Dynamic Margin Maximization and Improved Lipschitz Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00116v4)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the robustness of deep classifiers against adversarial perturbations, many approaches have been proposed, such as designing new architectures with better robustness properties (e.g., Lipschitz-capped networks), or modifying the training process itself (e.g., min-max optimization, constrained learning, or regularization). These approaches, however, might not be effective at increasing the margin in the input (feature) space. As a result, there has been an increasing interest in developing training procedures that can directly manipulate the decision boundary in the input space. In this paper, we build upon recent developments in this category by developing a robust training algorithm whose objective is to increase the margin in the output (logit) space while regularizing the Lipschitz constant of the model along vulnerable directions. We show that these two objectives can directly promote larger margins in the input space. To this end, we develop a scalable method for calculating guaranteed differentiable upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant of neural networks accurately and efficiently. The relative accuracy of the bounds prevents excessive regularization and allows for more direct manipulation of the decision boundary. Furthermore, our Lipschitz bounding algorithm exploits the monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity of the activation layers, and the resulting bounds can be used to design new layers with controllable bounds on their Lipschitz constant. Experiments on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny-ImageNet data sets verify that our proposed algorithm obtains competitively improved results compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>37th ...</summary><p>37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

This, together with the independent coupling between noise and target distributions, yields a vector field which is often non-straight. Such curved fields lead to a slow inference/generation process. In this work, we propose to learn flexible (potentially curved) interpolants in order to learn straight vector fields to enable faster generation. We formulate this via a multi-level optimization problem and propose an efficient approximate procedure to solve it. Our framework provides an end-to-end and simulation-free optimization procedure, which can be leveraged to learn straight line generative trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Delta...</summary><p>Delta workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While recent diffusion-based planning approaches show promise for simple manipulation tasks, they often produce unrealistic ghost states (e.g., the object automatically moves without hand contact) or lack adaptability when handling complex sequential interactions. In this work, we introduce DexHandDiff, an interaction-aware diffusion planning framework for adaptive dexterous manipulation. DexHandDiff models joint state-action dynamics through a dual-phase diffusion process which consists of pre-interaction contact alignment and post-contact goal-directed control, enabling goal-adaptive generalizable dexterous manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate dynamics model-based dual guidance and leverage large language models for automated guidance function generation, enhancing generalizability for physical interactions and facilitating diverse goal adaptation through language cues. Experiments on physical interaction tasks such as door opening, pen and block re-orientation, object relocation, and hammer striking demonstrate DexHandDiff's effectiveness on goals outside training distributions, achieving over twice the average success rate (59.2% vs. 29.5%) compared to existing methods. Our framework achieves an average of 70.7% success rate on goal adaptive dexterous tasks, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in contact-rich manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

While in this paper, we investigate the capability of GenAI for text-to-model generation, to see whether GenAI can comprehend hyper-level knowledge embedded within AI itself parameters. Specifically, we study a practical scenario termed train-once-for-all personalization, aiming to generate personalized models for diverse end-users and tasks using text prompts. Inspired by the recent emergence of neural network diffusion, we present Tina, a text-conditioned neural network diffusion for train-once-for-all personalization. Tina leverages a diffusion transformer model conditioned on task descriptions embedded using a CLIP model. Despite the astronomical number of potential personalized tasks (e.g., $1.73\times10^{13}$), by our design, Tina demonstrates remarkable in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization even trained on small datasets ($\sim 1000$). We further verify whether and how \Tina understands world knowledge by analyzing its capabilities under zero-shot/few-shot image prompts, different numbers of personalized classes, prompts of natural language descriptions, and predicting unseen entities.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, data scarcity caused by atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage hinders the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which rely on basic parameterized image transformations, often fail to introduce sufficient diversity across key semantic axes. These axes include natural changes such as snow and floods, human impacts like urbanization and roads, and disasters such as wildfires and storms, which limits the accuracy of AI models in EO applications. To address this, we propose a four-stage data augmentation approach that integrates diffusion models to enhance semantic diversity. Our method employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, vision-language models for rich captioning, EO-specific diffusion model fine-tuning, and iterative data augmentation. Extensive experiments using four augmentation techniques demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms established methods, generating semantically diverse EO images and improving AI model performance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Harmony: A Joint Self-Supervised and Weakly-Supervised Framework for Learning General Purpose Visual Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14239v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language contrastive learning frameworks like CLIP enable learning representations from natural language supervision, and provide strong zero-shot classification capabilities. However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different vision downstream tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and the previously leading joint self and weakly-supervised methods, MaskCLIP and SLIP. Specifically, when comparing against these methods, Harmony shows superior performance in fine-tuning and zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, and both object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO, when pre-training a ViT-B on CC3M. We also show that Harmony outperforms other self-supervised learning methods like iBOT and MAE across all tasks evaluated.

| **[Flip Learning: Weakly Supervised Erase to Segment Nodules in Breast Ultrasound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20685v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Medical Image Analysis. 24 pages, 13 figures, 18 tabels</p></details> |

We used five, two, and one year samples of hourly candle data for GameStop, Tesla, and XRP (Ripple) markets respectively. Applying a 15 hour rolling window for each market, we collected several features based on a linear model and other classical features to predict the next hour's movement. Subsequently, a GMM filtering approach was used to identify clusters among these markets. For each cluster, we applied the EMD algorithm to extract high, medium, low and trend components from each feature collected. A simple thresholding algorithm was applied to classify market movements based on the percentage change in each market's close price. We then evaluated the performance of various machine learning models, including Random Forests (RF) and XGBoost, in classifying market movements. A naive random selection of trading decisions was used as a benchmark, which assumed equal probabilities for each outcome, and a temporal cross-validation approach was used to test models on 40%, 30%, and 20% of the dataset. Our results indicate that transforming selected features using EMD improves performance, particularly for ensemble learning algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost, as measured by accumulated profit. Finally, GMM filtering expanded the range of learning algorithm and data source combinations that outperformed the top percentile of the random baseline.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Efforts to bring learning to a more local scale indeed lead to valuable insights, however, a general constructive approach to describe local learning goals that is both interpretable and adaptable across diverse tasks is still missing. We have previously formulated a local information processing goal that is highly adaptable and interpretable for a model neuron with compartmental structure. Building on recent advances in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), we here derive a corresponding parametric local learning rule, which allows us to introduce 'infomorphic' neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility of these networks to perform tasks from supervised, unsupervised and memory learning. By leveraging the interpretable nature of the PID framework, infomorphic networks represent a valuable tool to advance our understanding of the intricate structure of local learning.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |

However, the global nature of the contrastive loss makes VLMs focus predominantly on foreground objects, neglecting other crucial information in the image, which limits their effectiveness in downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose COSMOS: CrOSs-MOdality Self-distillation for vision-language pre-training that integrates a novel text-cropping strategy and cross-attention module into a self-supervised learning framework.

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data. In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG. We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

To evaluate this task, we curate a benchmark dataset, AvED-Bench, designed explicitly for zero-shot audio-video editing. AvED-Bench includes 110 videos, each with a 10-second duration, spanning 11 categories from VGGSound. It offers diverse prompts and scenarios that require precise alignment between auditory and visual elements, enabling robust evaluation. We identify limitations in existing zero-shot audio and video editing methods, particularly in synchronization and coherence between modalities, which often result in inconsistent outcomes. To address these challenges, we propose AvED, a zero-shot cross-modal delta denoising framework that leverages audio-video interactions to achieve synchronized and coherent edits. AvED demonstrates superior results on both AvED-Bench and the recent OAVE dataset to validate its generalization capabilities.

Existing methods improve VLM reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning, using meticulously annotated training data to enhance visual reasoning capabilities. However, this training paradigm may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, restricting the model's ability to transfer visual reasoning skills across domains and limiting its real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a novel reinforcement fine-tuning framework that significantly enhances generalization capabilities in visual reasoning tasks. Reason-RFT introduces a two-phase training framework for visual reasoning: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data activates the reasoning potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), followed by (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning that generates multiple reasoning-response pairs, significantly enhancing generalization in visual reasoning tasks. To evaluate Reason-RFT's visual reasoning capabilities, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset spanning visual counting, structure perception, and spatial transformation.cExperimental results demonstrate Reasoning-RFT's three key advantages: (1) Performance Enhancement: achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks, outperforming most mainstream open-source and proprietary models; (2) Generalization Superiority: consistently maintaining robust performance across diverse tasks and domains, outperforming alternative training paradigms; (3) Data Efficiency: excelling in few-shot learning scenarios while surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines.</p></details> | 35 pages, 22 figures |

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{UniSTD}, a unified Transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal modeling, which is inspired by advances in recent foundation models with the two-stage pretraining-then-adaption paradigm. Specifically, our work demonstrates that task-agnostic pretraining on 2D vision and vision-text datasets can build a generalizable model foundation for spatiotemporal learning, followed by specialized joint training on spatiotemporal datasets to enhance task-specific adaptability. To improve the learning capabilities across domains, our framework employs a rank-adaptive mixture-of-expert adaptation by using fractional interpolation to relax the discrete variables so that can be optimized in the continuous space. Additionally, we introduce a temporal module to incorporate temporal dynamics explicitly. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset covering 10 tasks across 4 disciplines, demonstrating that a unified spatiotemporal model can achieve scalable, cross-task learning and support up to 10 tasks simultaneously within one model while reducing training costs in multi-domain applications.

To address this, we introduce PhysGen3D, a novel framework that transforms a single image into an amodal, camera-centric, interactive 3D scene. By combining advanced image-based geometric and semantic understanding with physics-based simulation, PhysGen3D creates an interactive 3D world from a static image, enabling us to "imagine" and simulate future scenarios based on user input.

While in this paper, we investigate the capability of GenAI for text-to-model generation, to see whether GenAI can comprehend hyper-level knowledge embedded within AI itself parameters. Specifically, we study a practical scenario termed train-once-for-all personalization, aiming to generate personalized models for diverse end-users and tasks using text prompts. Inspired by the recent emergence of neural network diffusion, we present Tina, a text-conditioned neural network diffusion for train-once-for-all personalization. Tina leverages a diffusion transformer model conditioned on task descriptions embedded using a CLIP model. Despite the astronomical number of potential personalized tasks (e.g., $1.73\times10^{13}$), by our design, Tina demonstrates remarkable in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization even trained on small datasets ($\sim 1000$). We further verify whether and how \Tina understands world knowledge by analyzing its capabilities under zero-shot/few-shot image prompts, different numbers of personalized classes, prompts of natural language descriptions, and predicting unseen entities.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, data scarcity caused by atmospheric conditions, seasonal variations, and limited geographical coverage hinders the effective application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in EO. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which rely on basic parameterized image transformations, often fail to introduce sufficient diversity across key semantic axes. These axes include natural changes such as snow and floods, human impacts like urbanization and roads, and disasters such as wildfires and storms, which limits the accuracy of AI models in EO applications. To address this, we propose a four-stage data augmentation approach that integrates diffusion models to enhance semantic diversity. Our method employs meta-prompts for instruction generation, vision-language models for rich captioning, EO-specific diffusion model fine-tuning, and iterative data augmentation. Extensive experiments using four augmentation techniques demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms established methods, generating semantically diverse EO images and improving AI model performance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 12 figures |

However, due to the nature of the supervisory signal in these paradigms, they lack the ability to learn localized features, leading to degraded performance on dense prediction tasks like segmentation and detection. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods have shown the ability to learn granular representations, complementing the high-level features in vision-language training. In this work, we present Harmony, a framework that combines vision-language training with discriminative and generative self-supervision to learn visual features that can be generalized across different vision downstream tasks. Our framework is specifically designed to work on web-scraped data by not relying on negative examples and addressing the one-to-one correspondence issue using soft CLIP targets generated by an EMA model. We comprehensively evaluate Harmony across various vision downstream tasks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline CLIP and the previously leading joint self and weakly-supervised methods, MaskCLIP and SLIP. Specifically, when comparing against these methods, Harmony shows superior performance in fine-tuning and zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, semantic segmentation on ADE20K, and both object detection and instance segmentation on MS-COCO, when pre-training a ViT-B on CC3M.

Static embeddings often impose constraints on lexical flexibility, leading to suboptimal performance when faced with complex sentence structures or domain-specific terminology shifts. To address this limitation, a structured approach was developed for dynamically reconfiguring token embeddings through continuous geometric transformations, ensuring that representations evolved in response to evolving discourse structures. A manifold-based transformation mechanism was integrated to regulate lexical positioning, allowing embeddings to undergo controlled shifts while preserving linguistic relationships across varying textual contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that embedding reconfiguration contributed to reductions in perplexity, improved lexical coherence, and enhanced sentence-level continuity, particularly in structured and domain-adaptive text generation tasks. Comparative analyses of embedding drift indicated that dynamically restructured representations maintained stronger contextual consistency, reducing misalignment in token dependencies while preserving fluency in language modeling outputs. Computational overhead assessments confirmed that while training complexity increased due to the iterative refinement of embeddings, inference remained efficient, ensuring practical feasibility for real-time generation. Evaluations across multiple datasets further demonstrated that dynamically modulated embeddings exhibited broader lexical diversity, reducing repetitive token patterns and enabling a more adaptable representation learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

The proposed methodology constructs a probabilistic function space where word representations adhere to topological consistency, mitigating representational discontinuities commonly observed in transformer-based embeddings. Empirical evaluations reveal that probabilistic constraints enhance lexical coherence by refining contextual relationships, leading to improvements in semantic stability across multiple linguistic distributions. The application of divergence minimization techniques ensures that interpolated embeddings maintain probabilistic consistency while preserving computational feasibility for large-scale implementations. Experimental findings demonstrate that interpolated lexical manifolds improve representation density alignment, reducing anisotropic distortions in contextual embedding distributions. Comparative analyses with standard transformer-based models highlight that structured interpolation yields more stable representations, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained semantic differentiation. The statistical evaluation of embedding divergence confirms that probabilistic lexical manifolds reduce representational inconsistencies while maintaining coherence across varying scales of contextual abstraction. An assessment of computational efficiency reveals that while interpolation introduces minor processing overhead, the structured representation learning approach remains scalable for practical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Contextual Subspace Manifold Projection introduces a structured refinement technique that selectively reconfigures token embeddings through controlled subspace constraints, ensuring more stable and geometrically well-defined feature distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the structured intervention reduced anisotropy, leading to improved representation compactness while preserving semantic fidelity across transformer layers. Clustering analyses indicated that token embeddings exhibited greater feature separability, reinforcing the hypothesis that structured projection techniques enhance internal representation organization without sacrificing linguistic coherence. Gradient magnitude distributions suggested that the method introduced a smoother optimization trajectory, potentially contributing to more stable parameter updates throughout training. Computational overhead associated with the projection operations remained minimal, ensuring that the refinements did not introduce significant trade-offs in model efficiency or inference speed. Comparisons with standard embedding refinement techniques highlighted that structured manifold constraints provided a direct mechanism for improving representation quality without requiring additional gradient-based optimization. Perplexity evaluations confirmed that the adjustments did not negatively impact sequence coherence, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

A structured modulation mechanism was introduced to regulate hidden state transitions, ensuring that latent representation trajectories remain aligned with prior contextual dependencies while preserving generative flexibility. The modulation framework was designed to function within transformer-based architectures, dynamically constraining representation evolution without imposing external memory dependencies or extensive architectural modifications. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that structured latent adjustments contributed to reductions in perplexity fluctuations, entropy variance, and lexical instability, improving coherence in long-form text generation. Gradient propagation stability was further analyzed, revealing that the modulation process led to smoother optimization pathways, mitigating erratic fluctuations in weight updates across successive inference steps. The computational efficiency of the modulation process was assessed, showing that its integration within transformer-based architectures introduced only marginal overhead while maintaining compatibility with existing optimization frameworks. The structured modulation constraints also influenced syntactic variation, preventing excessive repetition while maintaining balanced sentence length distributions. Comparative evaluations against baseline models reinforced the role of controlled latent state evolution in improving pronoun resolution, logical consistency, and contextual alignment across autoregressive text generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18205v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans.

However, as SemCom continues to evolve, a multitude of security and privacy concerns have arisen, posing threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SemCom systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the technologies that can be utilized to secure SemCom. Firstly, we elaborate on the entire life cycle of SemCom, which includes the model training, model transfer, and semantic information transmission phases. Then, we identify the security and privacy issues that emerge during these three stages. Furthermore, we summarize the techniques available to mitigate these security and privacy threats, including data cleaning, robust learning, defensive strategies against backdoor attacks, adversarial training, differential privacy, cryptography, blockchain technology, model compression, and physical-layer security. Lastly, this paper outlines future research directions to guide researchers in related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>160 p...</summary><p>160 pages, 27 figures</p></details> |
| **[Robust Flower Cluster Matching Using The Unscented Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20631v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring flowers over time is essential for precision robotic pollination in agriculture. To accomplish this, a continuous spatial-temporal observation of plant growth can be done using stationary RGB-D cameras. However, image registration becomes a serious challenge due to changes in the visual appearance of the plant caused by the pollination process and occlusions from growth and camera angles. Plants flower in a manner that produces distinct clusters on branches. This paper presents a method for matching flower clusters using descriptors generated from RGB-D data and considers allowing for spatial uncertainty within the cluster. The proposed approach leverages the Unscented Transform to efficiently estimate plant descriptor uncertainty tolerances, enabling a robust image-registration process despite temporal changes. The Unscented Transform is used to handle the nonlinear transformations by propagating the uncertainty of flower positions to determine the variations in the descriptor domain. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the Unscented Transform results, confirming our method's effectiveness for flower cluster matching. Therefore, it can facilitate improved robotics pollination in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>*CASE...</summary><p>*CASE2025 Under Review*</p></details> |
| **[IAP: Improving Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models via Instance-Aware Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20612v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pre-trained vision-language models (PT-VLMs) often face a Multi-Domain Class-Incremental Learning (MCIL) scenario in practice, where several classes and domains of multi-modal tasks are incrementally arrived. Without access to previously learned tasks and unseen tasks, memory-constrained MCIL suffers from forward and backward forgetting. To alleviate the above challenges, parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFT), such as prompt tuning, are employed to adapt the PT-VLM to the diverse incrementally learned tasks. To achieve effective new task adaptation, existing methods only consider the effect of PEFT strategy selection, but neglect the influence of PEFT parameter setting (e.g., prompting). In this paper, we tackle the challenge of optimizing prompt designs for diverse tasks in MCIL and propose an Instance-Aware Prompting (IAP) framework. Specifically, our Instance-Aware Gated Prompting (IA-GP) module enhances adaptation to new tasks while mitigating forgetting by dynamically assigning prompts across transformer layers at the instance level. Our Instance-Aware Class-Distribution-Driven Prompting (IA-CDDP) improves the task adaptation process by determining an accurate task-label-related confidence score for each instance. Experimental evaluations across 11 datasets, using three performance metrics, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

The studied hypergeometric polynomials satisfy a higher order differential equation and generalize Laguerre polynomials. The theoretical study of the asymptotic distribution of the spectrum of these polynomials is an active research topic. In this article we do not contribute to the theory, but provide a practical method to contribute to further and better understanding of the asymptotic behavior. The polynomials under consideration fit into the class of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, satisfying a four--term recurrence relation. This allows computing the roots via a generalized eigenvalue problem. After condition enhancing similarity transformations, the problem is transformed into the computation of the eigenvalues of a comrade matrix, which is a symmetric tridiagonal modified by a rank--one matrix. The eigenvalues are then retrieved by relying on an existing structured rank based fast algorithm. Numerical examples are reported studying the accuracy, stability and conforming the efficiency for various parameter settings of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[A Theoretical Framework for Prompt Engineering: Approximating Smooth Functions with Transformer Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20561v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their performance across diverse tasks. Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning, decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments. However, the theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network during inference. Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal computations dynamically. Building on this construction, we establish an approximation theory for $\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when guided by appropriately structured prompts. Moreover, our framework provides theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging multi-agent interactions. By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design.</p></details> | 55 pages, 2 figures |

In this paper, we introduce a multimodal generation framework that incorporates four major data modalities, including a novel addition of map modality. With tokenized modalities, our scene sequence generation framework autoregressively predicts each scene while managing computational demands through a two-stage approach. The Temporal AutoRegressive (TAR) component captures inter-frame dynamics for each modality while the Ordered AutoRegressive (OAR) component aligns modalities within each scene by sequentially predicting tokens in a fixed order. To maintain coherence between map and ego-action modalities, we introduce the Action-aware Map Alignment (AMA) module, which applies a transformation based on the ego-action to maintain coherence between these modalities. Our framework effectively generates complex, realistic driving scenes over extended sequences, ensuring multimodal consistency and offering fine-grained control over scene elements.

It has shown promising results across various tasks due to its generalizability and interpretability. The use of CLIP has recently gained increasing interest in the medical imaging domain, serving as a pre-training paradigm for image-text alignment, or a critical component in diverse clinical tasks.

Although current alignment methods rely primarily on explicit feedback, eye-tracking (ET) data offers insights into real-time cognitive processing during reading. In this paper, we present OASST-ETC, a novel eye-tracking corpus capturing reading patterns from 24 participants, while evaluating LLM-generated responses from the OASST1 dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct reading patterns between preferred and non-preferred responses, which we compare with synthetic eye-tracking data. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human reading measures and attention patterns from various transformer-based models, discovering stronger correlations in preferred responses. This work introduces a unique resource for studying human cognitive processing in LLM evaluation and suggests promising directions for incorporating eye-tracking data into alignment methods.

However, applying these advances to 3D generation presents three key challenges: the unordered nature of 3D data conflicts with sequential next-token prediction paradigm, conventional vector quantization approaches incur substantial compression loss when applied to 3D meshes, and the lack of efficient scaling strategies for higher resolution latent prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce MAR-3D, which integrates a pyramid variational autoencoder with a cascaded masked auto-regressive transformer (Cascaded MAR) for progressive latent upscaling in the continuous space. Our architecture employs random masking during training and auto-regressive denoising in random order during inference, naturally accommodating the unordered property of 3D latent tokens. Additionally, we propose a cascaded training strategy with condition augmentation that enables efficiently up-scale the latent token resolution with fast convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR-3D not only achieves superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods but also exhibits enhanced scaling capabilities compared to joint distribution modeling approaches (e.g., diffusion transformers).</p></details> | <details><summary>Aceep...</summary><p>Aceepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Amplified Semantic Entropy for Hallucination Detection in Medical Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20504v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). Yet, they remain prone to hallucinations-incorrect responses that contradict input images, posing substantial risks in clinical decision-making. Detecting these hallucinations is essential for establishing trust in MLLMs among clinicians and patients, thereby enabling their real-world adoption. Current hallucination detection methods, especially semantic entropy (SE), have demonstrated promising hallucination detection capacity for LLMs. However, adapting SE to medical MLLMs by incorporating visual perturbations presents a dilemma. Weak perturbations preserve image content and ensure clinical validity, but may be overlooked by medical MLLMs, which tend to over rely on language priors. In contrast, strong perturbations can distort essential diagnostic features, compromising clinical interpretation. To address this issue, we propose Vision Amplified Semantic Entropy (VASE), which incorporates weak image transformations and amplifies the impact of visual input, to improve hallucination detection in medical VQA. We first estimate the semantic predictive distribution under weak visual transformations to preserve clinical validity, and then amplify visual influence by contrasting this distribution with that derived from a distorted image. The entropy of the resulting distribution is estimated as VASE. Experiments on two medical open-ended VQA datasets demonstrate that VASE consistently outperforms existing hallucination detection methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

This study evaluates various architectures and compares their BER and BLER performance across different noise levels. Two novel models, the Dual Attention Transformer (DAT) and the Residual Dual Non-Local Attention Network (RDNLA), integrate self-attention and residual learning to enhance signal reconstruction. These models bypass conventional channel estimation and equalization by directly predicting log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) from received signals, with noise variance as an additional input. Simulations show that DAT and RDNLA outperform traditional and other neural receiver models under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), while their computational efficiency supports their feasibility for next-generation communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Will ...</summary><p>Will be submitted to IEEE Conference</p></details> |
| **[Automated and Risk-Aware Engine Control Calibration Using Constrained Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20493v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decarbonization of the transport sector sets increasingly strict demands to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas emissions of Internal Combustion Engines. This has led to complex engines with a surge in the number of corresponding tunable parameters in actuator set points and control settings. Automated calibration is therefore essential to keep development time and costs at acceptable levels. In this work, an innovative self-learning calibration method is presented based on in-cylinder pressure curve shaping. This method combines Principal Component Decomposition with constrained Bayesian Optimization. To realize maximal thermal engine efficiency, the optimization problem aims at minimizing the difference between the actual in-cylinder pressure curve and an Idealized Thermodynamic Cycle. By continuously updating a Gaussian Process Regression model of the pressure's Principal Components weights using measurements of the actual operating conditions, the mean in-cylinder pressure curve as well as its uncertainty bounds are learned. This information drives the optimization of calibration parameters, which are automatically adapted while dealing with the risks and uncertainties associated with operational safety and combustion stability. This data-driven method does not require prior knowledge of the system. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated in simulation using a Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition engine model. The difference between the Gross Indicated Efficiency of the optimal solution found and the true optimum is 0.017%. For this complex engine, the optimal solution was found after 64.4s, which is relatively fast compared to conventional calibration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables; Submitted to Control Engineering Practice's special issue on 'Bayesian optimization for data-driven modeling, optimization and control: Towards enhancing performance, efficiency, and sustainability in industrial, energy and biomedical systems'</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient and General-Purpose Few-Shot Misclassification Detection for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20492v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable prediction by classifiers is crucial for their deployment in high security and dynamically changing situations. However, modern neural networks often exhibit overconfidence for misclassified predictions, highlighting the need for confidence estimation to detect errors. Despite the achievements obtained by existing methods on small-scale datasets, they all require training from scratch and there are no efficient and effective misclassification detection (MisD) methods, hindering practical application towards large-scale and ever-changing datasets. In this paper, we pave the way to exploit vision language model (VLM) leveraging text information to establish an efficient and general-purpose misclassification detection framework. By harnessing the power of VLM, we construct FSMisD, a Few-Shot prompt learning framework for MisD to refrain from training from scratch and therefore improve tuning efficiency. To enhance misclassification detection ability, we use adaptive pseudo sample generation and a novel negative loss to mitigate the issue of overconfidence by pushing category prompts away from pseudo features. We conduct comprehensive experiments with prompt learning methods and validate the generalization ability across various datasets with domain shift. Significant and consistent improvement demonstrates the effectiveness, efficiency and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Bayesian Modeling of Zero-Shot Classifications for Urban Flood Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14754v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street scene datasets, collected from Street View or dashboard cameras, offer a promising means of detecting urban objects and incidents like street flooding. However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of reliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely, and ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we propose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty. First, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model on the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate large training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in urban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across locations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation zones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs provide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time periods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to baseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external predictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to improve urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at high risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic biases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More broadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations represents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large labeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing the expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.</p></details> | In review |

We propose a new pedagogy for teaching pointers in the C programming language using graph transformation systems to visually simulate pointer manipulation. In an Introduction to C course, the topic of pointers is often the most difficult one for students to understand; therefore, we experiment with graph-based representations of dynamic pointer structures to reinforce the learning. Groove, a graph transformation tool, is used to illustrate the behaviour of pointers through modelling and simulation. A study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.

In general, achieving the complexity of graph algorithms in conventional languages using graph transformation rules is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be executed in linear time using the graph programming language GP 2. However, for non-destructive algorithms that retain the structure of input graphs, achieving linear runtime required input graphs to be connected and of bounded node degree. In this paper, we overcome these preconditions by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies, a cycle detection program, a program for numbering the connected components of a graph, and a breadth-first search program. Each of these programs runs in linear time on both connected and disconnected input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. We give empirical evidence for the linear time complexity by using timings for various classes of input graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GCM 2023 and 2024, arXiv:2503.19632. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.09144</p></details> |

| **[Lipschitz Constant Meets Condition Number: Learning Robust and Compact Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20454v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has revealed that high compression of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), e.g., massive pruning of the weight matrix of a DNN, leads to a severe drop in accuracy and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Integration of network pruning into an adversarial training framework has been proposed to promote adversarial robustness. It has been observed that a highly pruned weight matrix tends to be ill-conditioned, i.e., increasing the condition number of the weight matrix. This phenomenon aggravates the vulnerability of a DNN to input noise. Although a highly pruned weight matrix is considered to be able to lower the upper bound of the local Lipschitz constant to tolerate large distortion, the ill-conditionedness of such a weight matrix results in a non-robust DNN model. To overcome this challenge, this work develops novel joint constraints to adjust the weight distribution of networks, namely, the Transformed Sparse Constraint joint with Condition Number Constraint (TSCNC), which copes with smoothing distribution and differentiable constraint functions to reduce condition number and thus avoid the ill-conditionedness of weight matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical analyses unveil the relevance between the condition number and the local Lipschitz constant of the weight matrix, namely, the sharply increasing condition number becomes the dominant factor that restricts the robustness of over-sparsified models. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public datasets, and the results show that the proposed constraints significantly improve the robustness of a DNN with high pruning rates.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Scaling Laws of Synthetic Data for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19551v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, largely driven by high-quality web data used in pre-training. However, recent studies indicate this data source is rapidly depleting. Synthetic data emerges as a promising alternative, but it remains unclear whether synthetic datasets exhibit predictable scalability comparable to raw pre-training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by introducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora into diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by automatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple documents using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical experiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that reliably adheres to the rectified scaling law across various model sizes; (2) Performance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models approach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B model peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons with existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate that SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability. Our findings highlight synthetic data as a scalable and reliable alternative to organic pre-training corpora, offering a viable path toward continued improvement in model performance.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Siformer: Feature-isolated Transformer for Efficient Skeleton-based Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20436v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sign language recognition (SLR) refers to interpreting sign language glosses from given videos automatically. This research area presents a complex challenge in computer vision because of the rapid and intricate movements inherent in sign languages, which encompass hand gestures, body postures, and even facial expressions. Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to handle variations in subjects and backgrounds independently. However, current skeleton-based SLR methods exhibit three limitations: 1) they often neglect the importance of realistic hand poses, where most studies train SLR models on non-realistic skeletal representations; 2) they tend to assume complete data availability in both training or inference phases, and capture intricate relationships among different body parts collectively; 3) these methods treat all sign glosses uniformly, failing to account for differences in complexity levels regarding skeletal representations. To enhance the realism of hand skeletal representations, we present a kinematic hand pose rectification method for enforcing constraints. Mitigating the impact of missing data, we propose a feature-isolated mechanism to focus on capturing local spatial-temporal context. This method captures the context concurrently and independently from individual features, thus enhancing the robustness of the SLR model. Additionally, to adapt to varying complexity levels of sign glosses, we develop an input-adaptive inference approach to optimise computational efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as evidenced by achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on WLASL100 and LSA64. For WLASL100, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 86.50\%, marking a relative improvement of 2.39% over the previous SOTA.

The IVTON task involves seamlessly superimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another, creating a realistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike conventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large pre-trained U-Net architectures, ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight, scalable transformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme, achieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key component of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA), a dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image encoder into a unified feature of the same size, guided by diffusion timestep and garment image complexity. This enables adaptive weighting of features, allowing the model to emphasize either global information or fine-grained details based on the requirements of the denoising stage. Additionally, the Salient Region Extractor (SRE) module is presented to identify complex region of the garment to provide high-resolution local information to the denoising model as an additional condition alongside the global information of the full garment image. This targeted conditioning strategy enhances detail preservation of fine details in highly salient garment regions, optimizing computational resources by avoiding unnecessarily processing entire garment image. Comparative evaluations confirms that ITA-MDT improves efficiency while maintaining strong performance, reaching state-of-the-art results in several metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project Page: https://jiwoohong93.github.io/ita-mdt/</p></details> |

To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data.

The primary aging mechanism in discrete semiconductors and power modules is the bond wire lift-off, caused by crack growth due to thermal fatigue. The process is empirically characterized by exponential growth and an abrupt end of life, making long-term aging forecasts challenging. This research presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of different forecasting methods for MOSFET failure forecasting applications. Classical tracking, statistical forecasting and Neural Network (NN) based forecasting models are implemented along with novel Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFTs). A comprehensive comparison is performed assessing their MOSFET ageing forecasting ability for different forecasting horizons. For short-term predictions, all algorithms result in acceptable results, with the best results produced by classical NN forecasting models at the expense of higher computations. For long-term forecasting, only the TFT is able to produce valid outcomes owing to the ability to integrate covariates from the expected future conditions.

Current methodologies, such as manual expert-driven processes, iterative-feedback techniques, and exploration-generative tactics, have shown promise in automating such data engineering workflow by minimizing human involvement. However, three challenges remain in those frameworks: (1) It predominantly depends on downstream task performance metrics, as assessment is time-consuming, especially for large datasets. (2) The diversity of feature combinations will hardly be guaranteed after random exploration ends. (3) Rare significant transformations lead to sparse valuable feedback that hinders the learning processes or leads to less effective results. In response to these challenges, we introduce FastFT, an innovative framework that leverages a trio of advanced strategies.We first decouple the feature transformation evaluation from the outcomes of the generated datasets via the performance predictor. To address the issue of reward sparsity, we developed a method to evaluate the novelty of generated transformation sequences. Incorporating this novelty into the reward function accelerates the model's exploration of effective transformations, thereby improving the search productivity. Additionally, we combine novelty and performance to create a prioritized memory buffer, ensuring that essential experiences are effectively revisited during exploration. Our extensive experimental evaluations validate the performance, efficiency, and traceability of our proposed framework, showcasing its superiority in handling complex feature transformation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, Accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |

To explore the future potentials and risks of this understudied area, we created six design fictions depicting scenarios such as virtual companions delivering news summaries to the user, AI providing context to news topics, and content being transformed into other formats on demand. The fictions, discussed with a multi-disciplinary group of experts, enabled a critical examination of the diverse ethical, societal, and journalistic implications of AI shaping this everyday activity. The discussions raised several concerns, suggesting that such consumer-oriented AI applications can clash with journalistic values and processes. These include fears that neither consumers nor AI could successfully balance engagement, objectivity, and truth, leading to growing detachment from shared understanding. We offer critical insights into the potential long-term effects to guide design efforts in this emerging application area of GenAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 figures, Accepted by CHI '25</p></details> |

However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is planed to be submitted to a journal</p></details> |
| **[Pluggable Style Representation Learning for Multi-Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20368v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the high diversity of image styles, the scalability to various styles plays a critical role in real-world applications. To accommodate a large amount of styles, previous multi-style transfer approaches rely on enlarging the model size while arbitrary-style transfer methods utilize heavy backbones. However, the additional computational cost introduced by more model parameters hinders these methods to be deployed on resource-limited devices. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a style transfer framework by decoupling the style modeling and transferring. Specifically, for style modeling, we propose a style representation learning scheme to encode the style information into a compact representation. Then, for style transferring, we develop a style-aware multi-style transfer network (SaMST) to adapt to diverse styles using pluggable style representations. In this way, our framework is able to accommodate diverse image styles in the learned style representations without introducing additional overhead during inference, thereby maintaining efficiency. Experiments show that our style representation can extract accurate style information. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

However, its adoption is hindered by the prevalence of standard notations like workflow nets (WF-nets) and BPMN in practice. This paper presents a novel algorithm for transforming safe and sound WF-net into equivalent POWL models. The algorithm recursively identifies structural patterns within the WF-net and translates them into their POWL representation. We formally prove the correctness of our approach, showing that the generated POWL model preserves the language of the input WF-net. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high scalability of our algorithm, and we show its completeness on a subclass of WF-nets that encompasses equivalent representations for all POWL models. This work bridges the gap between the theoretical advantages of POWL and the practical need for compatibility with established notations, paving the way for broader adoption of POWL in process analysis and improvement applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The V...</summary><p>The Version of Record of this contribution will be published in the proceedings of the 46th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency (Petri Nets 2025).

However, current methods still suffer from two challenges. First, bit-depth compression produces a uniform depth representation in regions with subtle variations, hindering the recovery of detailed information. Second, densely distributed random noise reduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, termed geometry-decoupled network (GDNet), for compressed depth map super-resolution that decouples the high-quality depth map reconstruction process by handling global and detailed geometric features separately. To be specific, we propose the fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine geometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while simultaneously enriching them with complementary information from low-resolution context-level image features. In addition, we develop the global geometry encoder (GGE) that aims at suppressing noise and extracting global geometric information effectively via constructing compact feature representation in a low-rank space. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our GDNet significantly outperforms current methods in terms of geometric consistency and detail recovery.

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025; 21 pages, 23 figures, Project page: https://onevfall.github.io/project_page/ditctrl ; GitHub repository: https://github.com/TencentARC/DiTCtrl</p></details> |

| **[Mobile-MMLU: A Mobile Intelligence Language Understanding Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20786v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have increased interest in deploying them on mobile devices for on-device AI applications. Mobile users interact differently with LLMs compared to desktop users, creating unique expectations and data biases. Current benchmark datasets primarily target at server and desktop environments, and there is a notable lack of extensive datasets specifically designed for mobile contexts. Additionally, mobile devices face strict limitations in storage and computing resources, constraining model size and capabilities, thus requiring optimized efficiency and prioritized knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce Mobile-MMLU, a large-scale benchmark dataset tailored for mobile intelligence. It consists of 16,186 questions across 80 mobile-related fields, designed to evaluate LLM performance in realistic mobile scenarios. A challenging subset, Mobile-MMLU-Pro, provides advanced evaluation similar in size to MMLU-Pro but significantly more difficult than our standard full set. Both benchmarks use multiple-choice, order-invariant questions focused on practical mobile interactions, such as recipe suggestions, travel planning, and essential daily tasks. The dataset emphasizes critical mobile-specific metrics like inference latency, energy consumption, memory usage, and response quality, offering comprehensive insights into model performance under mobile constraints. Moreover, it prioritizes privacy and adaptability, assessing models' ability to perform on-device processing, maintain user privacy, and adapt to personalized usage patterns. Mobile-MMLU family offers a standardized framework for developing and comparing mobile-optimized LLMs, enabling advancements in productivity and decision-making within mobile computing environments.

Given a new design task -- for example, to design novel proteins with high binding affinity to a therapeutic target -- one must choose a design algorithm and specify any hyperparameters and predictive and/or generative models involved. How can these decisions be made such that the resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design algorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion -- for example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold. It does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from prediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data distributions are known. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated protein and RNA design tasks, in settings with either known or estimated density ratios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Assessing Consistency and Reproducibility in the Outputs of Large Language Models: Evidence Across Diverse Finance and Accounting Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16974v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of consistency and reproducibility in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in finance and accounting research. We evaluate how consistently LLMs produce outputs given identical inputs through extensive experimentation with 50 independent runs across five common tasks: classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, text generation, and prediction. Using three OpenAI models (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o), we generate over 3.4 million outputs from diverse financial source texts and data, covering MD&As, FOMC statements, finance news articles, earnings call transcripts, and financial statements. Our findings reveal substantial but task-dependent consistency, with binary classification and sentiment analysis achieving near-perfect reproducibility, while complex tasks show greater variability. More advanced models do not consistently demonstrate better consistency and reproducibility, with task-specific patterns emerging. LLMs significantly outperform expert human annotators in consistency and maintain high agreement even where human experts significantly disagree. We further find that simple aggregation strategies across 3-5 runs dramatically improve consistency. We also find that aggregation may come with an additional benefit of improved accuracy for sentiment analysis when using newer models. Simulation analysis reveals that despite measurable inconsistency in LLM outputs, downstream statistical inferences remain remarkably robust. These findings address concerns about what we term "G-hacking," the selective reporting of favorable outcomes from multiple Generative AI runs, by demonstrating that such risks are relatively low for finance and accounting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>97 pa...</summary><p>97 pages, 20 tables, 15 figures</p></details> |

Traditional activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, have been widely used with considerable success. However, these functions may not always provide optimal performance for all tasks and datasets. In this paper, we introduce Neuvo GEAF - an innovative approach leveraging grammatical evolution (GE) to automatically evolve novel activation functions tailored to specific neural network architectures and datasets. Experiments conducted on well-known binary classification datasets show statistically significant improvements in F1-score (between 2.4% and 9.4%) over ReLU using identical network architectures. Notably, these performance gains were achieved without increasing the network's parameter count, supporting the trend toward more efficient neural networks that can operate effectively on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper's findings suggest that evolved activation functions can provide significant performance improvements for compact networks while maintaining energy efficiency during both training and inference phases.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, IEEE</p></details> |

However, performance is typically evaluated based on multiple parameters and few datasets, creating challenges in assessing which method is best for aligning data at scale. Here, we introduce the K-Neighbors Intersection (KNI) score, a single score that both penalizes batch effects and measures accuracy at cross-dataset cell-type label prediction alongside carefully curated small (scMARK) and large (scREF) benchmarks comprising 11 and 46 human scRNA studies respectively, where we have standardized author labels. Using the KNI score, we evaluate and optimize approaches for cross-dataset single-cell RNA integration. We introduce Batch Adversarial single-cell Variational Inference (BA-scVI), as a new variant of scVI that uses adversarial training to penalize batch-effects in the encoder and decoder, and show this approach outperforms other methods. In the resulting aligned space, we find that the granularity of cell-type groupings is conserved, supporting the notion that whole-organism cell-type maps can be created by a single model without loss of information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 LMRL workshop (International Conference on Learning Representations, Learning Meaningful Representations of Life Workshop)</p></details> |

While recent studies have developed link prediction (LP) methods to infer missing relations for knowledge graphs (KGs) containing n-ary relational facts, they are generally limited to transductive settings. Fully inductive settings, where predictions are made on previously unseen entities, remain a significant challenge. As existing methods are mainly entity embedding-based, they struggle to capture entity-independent logical rules. To fill in this gap, we propose an n-ary subgraph reasoning framework for fully inductive link prediction (ILP) on n-ary relational facts. This framework reasons over local subgraphs and has a strong inductive inference ability to capture n-ary patterns. Specifically, we introduce a novel graph structure, the n-ary semantic hypergraph, to facilitate subgraph extraction. Moreover, we develop a subgraph aggregating network, NS-HART, to effectively mine complex semantic correlations within subgraphs. Theoretically, we provide a thorough analysis from the score function optimization perspective to shed light on NS-HART's effectiveness for n-ary ILP tasks. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on a series of inductive benchmarks, including transfer reasoning (with and without entity features) and pairwise subgraph reasoning. The results highlight the superiority of the n-ary subgraph reasoning framework and the exceptional inductive ability of NS-HART.

In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data. In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG. We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

Static embeddings often impose constraints on lexical flexibility, leading to suboptimal performance when faced with complex sentence structures or domain-specific terminology shifts. To address this limitation, a structured approach was developed for dynamically reconfiguring token embeddings through continuous geometric transformations, ensuring that representations evolved in response to evolving discourse structures. A manifold-based transformation mechanism was integrated to regulate lexical positioning, allowing embeddings to undergo controlled shifts while preserving linguistic relationships across varying textual contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that embedding reconfiguration contributed to reductions in perplexity, improved lexical coherence, and enhanced sentence-level continuity, particularly in structured and domain-adaptive text generation tasks. Comparative analyses of embedding drift indicated that dynamically restructured representations maintained stronger contextual consistency, reducing misalignment in token dependencies while preserving fluency in language modeling outputs. Computational overhead assessments confirmed that while training complexity increased due to the iterative refinement of embeddings, inference remained efficient, ensuring practical feasibility for real-time generation. Evaluations across multiple datasets further demonstrated that dynamically modulated embeddings exhibited broader lexical diversity, reducing repetitive token patterns and enabling a more adaptable representation learning process.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Contextual Subspace Manifold Projection introduces a structured refinement technique that selectively reconfigures token embeddings through controlled subspace constraints, ensuring more stable and geometrically well-defined feature distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that the structured intervention reduced anisotropy, leading to improved representation compactness while preserving semantic fidelity across transformer layers. Clustering analyses indicated that token embeddings exhibited greater feature separability, reinforcing the hypothesis that structured projection techniques enhance internal representation organization without sacrificing linguistic coherence. Gradient magnitude distributions suggested that the method introduced a smoother optimization trajectory, potentially contributing to more stable parameter updates throughout training. Computational overhead associated with the projection operations remained minimal, ensuring that the refinements did not introduce significant trade-offs in model efficiency or inference speed. Comparisons with standard embedding refinement techniques highlighted that structured manifold constraints provided a direct mechanism for improving representation quality without requiring additional gradient-based optimization. Perplexity evaluations confirmed that the adjustments did not negatively impact sequence coherence, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

A structured modulation mechanism was introduced to regulate hidden state transitions, ensuring that latent representation trajectories remain aligned with prior contextual dependencies while preserving generative flexibility. The modulation framework was designed to function within transformer-based architectures, dynamically constraining representation evolution without imposing external memory dependencies or extensive architectural modifications. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that structured latent adjustments contributed to reductions in perplexity fluctuations, entropy variance, and lexical instability, improving coherence in long-form text generation. Gradient propagation stability was further analyzed, revealing that the modulation process led to smoother optimization pathways, mitigating erratic fluctuations in weight updates across successive inference steps. The computational efficiency of the modulation process was assessed, showing that its integration within transformer-based architectures introduced only marginal overhead while maintaining compatibility with existing optimization frameworks. The structured modulation constraints also influenced syntactic variation, preventing excessive repetition while maintaining balanced sentence length distributions. Comparative evaluations against baseline models reinforced the role of controlled latent state evolution in improving pronoun resolution, logical consistency, and contextual alignment across autoregressive text generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18205v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

While recent advancements have shown promising results in generating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed generation. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating diffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in previous works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic framework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables flexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable quality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with our newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a lightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of the vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder drastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply FlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo.

| **[Statistical Inference for Weighted Sample Average Approximation in Contextual Stochastic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12747v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual stochastic optimization provides a framework for decision-making under uncertainty incorporating observable contextual information through covariates. We analyze statistical inference for weighted sample average approximation (wSAA), a widely-used method for solving contextual stochastic optimization problems. We first establish central limit theorems for wSAA estimates of optimal values when problems can be solved exactly, characterizing how estimation uncertainty scales with covariate sample size. We then investigate practical scenarios with computational budget constraints, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between statistical accuracy and computational cost as sample sizes increase. Through central limit theorems for budget-constrained wSAA estimates, we precisely characterize this statistical-computational tradeoff. We also develop "over-optimizing" strategies for solving wSAA problems that ensure valid statistical inference. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body: 34 pages, 8 figures; supplemental material: 38 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |
| **[On computing the zeros of a class of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20567v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fast and weakly stable method for computing the zeros of a particular class of hypergeometric polynomials is presented. The studied hypergeometric polynomials satisfy a higher order differential equation and generalize Laguerre polynomials. The theoretical study of the asymptotic distribution of the spectrum of these polynomials is an active research topic. In this article we do not contribute to the theory, but provide a practical method to contribute to further and better understanding of the asymptotic behavior. The polynomials under consideration fit into the class of Sobolev orthogonal polynomials, satisfying a four--term recurrence relation. This allows computing the roots via a generalized eigenvalue problem. After condition enhancing similarity transformations, the problem is transformed into the computation of the eigenvalues of a comrade matrix, which is a symmetric tridiagonal modified by a rank--one matrix. The eigenvalues are then retrieved by relying on an existing structured rank based fast algorithm. Numerical examples are reported studying the accuracy, stability and conforming the efficiency for various parameter settings of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Among the critical shared GPU resources, there has been very limited analysis on the dynamic allocation of compute units and VRAM bandwidth, mainly for two reasons: (1) The native GPU resource management solutions are either hardware-specific, or unable to dynamically allocate resources to different tenants, or both; (2) NVIDIA doesn't expose interfaces for VRAM bandwidth allocation, and the software stack and VRAM channel architectures are black-box, both of which limit the software-level resource management. These drive prior work to design either conservative sharing policies detrimental to throughput, or static resource partitioning only applicable to a few GPU models. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes SGDRC, a fully software-defined dynamic VRAM bandwidth and compute unit management solution for concurrent DNN inference services. SGDRC aims at guaranteeing service quality, maximizing the overall throughput, and providing general applicability to NVIDIA GPUs. SGDRC first reveals a general VRAM channel hash mapping architecture of NVIDIA GPUs through comprehensive reverse engineering and eliminates VRAM channel conflicts using software-level cache coloring. SGDRC applies bimodal tensors and tidal SM masking to dynamically allocate VRAM bandwidth and compute units, and guides the allocation of resources based on offline profiling. We evaluate 11 mainstream DNNs with real-world workloads on two NVIDIA GPUs. The results show that compared with the state-of-the-art GPU sharing solutions, SGDRC achieves the highest SLO attainment rates (99.0% on average), and improves overall throughput by up to 1.47x and BE job throughput by up to 2.36x.</p></details> | 15 pages, 19 figures |
| **[A Theoretical Framework for Prompt Engineering: Approximating Smooth Functions with Transformer Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20561v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their performance across diverse tasks. Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning, decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments. However, the theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network during inference. Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal computations dynamically. Building on this construction, we establish an approximation theory for $\beta$-times differentiable functions, proving that transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when guided by appropriately structured prompts. Moreover, our framework provides theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging multi-agent interactions. By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design.</p></details> | 55 pages, 2 figures |

Due to anycast's crucial role on the modern Internet, earlier research introduced tools to perform anycast censuses. The first, iGreedy, uses latency measurements from geographically dispersed locations to map anycast deployments. The second, MAnycast2, uses anycast to perform a census of other anycast networks. MAnycast2's advantage is speed, performing an Internet-wide census in 3 hours, but it suffers from problems with accuracy and precision. Inversely, iGreedy is highly accurate but much slower. On top of that, iGreedy has a much higher probing cost. In this paper we address the shortcomings of both systems and present MAnycast Reloaded (MAnycastR). Taking MAnycast2 as a basis, we completely redesign its measurement pipeline, and add support for distributed probing, additional protocols (UDP, TCP and IPv6) and latency measurements similar to iGreedy. We validate MAnycastR on an anycast testbed with 32 globally distributed nodes, compare against an external anycast production deployment and extensive latency measurements with RIPE Atlas, and cross-check over 60% of detected anycast prefixes against operator ground truth. This shows that MAnycastR achieves high accuracy and precision. We make continual daily MAnycastR censuses available to the community and release the source code of the tool under a permissive open source license.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Injecting Adrenaline into LLM Serving: Boosting Resource Utilization and Throughput via Attention Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20552v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large language model (LLM) serving systems, executing each request consists of two phases: the compute-intensive prefill phase and the memory-intensive decoding phase. To prevent performance interference between the two phases, current LLM serving systems typically adopt prefill-decoding disaggregation, where the two phases are split across separate machines. However, we observe this approach leads to significant resource underutilization. Specifically, prefill instances that are compute-intensive suffer from low memory utilization, while decoding instances that are memory-intensive experience low compute utilization. To address this problem, this paper proposes Adrenaline, an attention disaggregation and offloading mechanism designed to enhance resource utilization and performance in LLM serving systems. Adrenaline's key innovation lies in disaggregating part of the attention computation in the decoding phase and offloading them to prefill instances. The memory-bound nature of decoding-phase attention computation inherently enables an effective offloading strategy, yielding two complementary advantages: 1) improved memory capacity and bandwidth utilization in prefill instances, and 2) increased decoding batch sizes that enhance compute utilization in decoding instances, collectively boosting overall system performance. Adrenaline achieves these gains through three key techniques: low-latency decoding synchronization, resource-efficient prefill colocation, and load-aware offloading scheduling. Experimental results show that Adrenaline achieves 2.28x higher memory capacity and 2.07x better memory bandwidth utilization in prefill instances, up to 1.67x improvements in compute utilization for decoding instances, and 1.68x higher overall inference throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.</p></details> | 14 pages, 18 figures |

However, they are often criticized for two significant problems: 1) slow training and inference speed, and 2) inadequate recovery of fine-grained facial details. To address these problems, we propose a novel Truncated Diffusion model for efficient Blind Face Restoration (TD-BFR), a three-stage paradigm tailored for the progressive resolution of degraded images. Specifically, TD-BFR utilizes an innovative truncated sampling method, starting from low-quality (LQ) images at low resolution to enhance sampling speed, and then introduces an adaptive degradation removal module to handle unknown degradations and connect the generation processes across different resolutions. Additionally, we further adapt the priors of pre-trained diffusion models to recover rich facial details. Our method efficiently restores high-quality images in a coarse-to-fine manner and experimental results demonstrate that TD-BFR is, on average, \textbf{4.75$\times$} faster than current state-of-the-art diffusion-based BFR methods while maintaining competitive quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025</p></details> |

However, applying these advances to 3D generation presents three key challenges: the unordered nature of 3D data conflicts with sequential next-token prediction paradigm, conventional vector quantization approaches incur substantial compression loss when applied to 3D meshes, and the lack of efficient scaling strategies for higher resolution latent prediction. To address these challenges, we introduce MAR-3D, which integrates a pyramid variational autoencoder with a cascaded masked auto-regressive transformer (Cascaded MAR) for progressive latent upscaling in the continuous space. Our architecture employs random masking during training and auto-regressive denoising in random order during inference, naturally accommodating the unordered property of 3D latent tokens. Additionally, we propose a cascaded training strategy with condition augmentation that enables efficiently up-scale the latent token resolution with fast convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAR-3D not only achieves superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods but also exhibits enhanced scaling capabilities compared to joint distribution modeling approaches (e.g., diffusion transformers).</p></details> | <details><summary>Aceep...</summary><p>Aceepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Automated and Risk-Aware Engine Control Calibration Using Constrained Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20493v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decarbonization of the transport sector sets increasingly strict demands to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize greenhouse gas emissions of Internal Combustion Engines. This has led to complex engines with a surge in the number of corresponding tunable parameters in actuator set points and control settings. Automated calibration is therefore essential to keep development time and costs at acceptable levels. In this work, an innovative self-learning calibration method is presented based on in-cylinder pressure curve shaping. This method combines Principal Component Decomposition with constrained Bayesian Optimization. To realize maximal thermal engine efficiency, the optimization problem aims at minimizing the difference between the actual in-cylinder pressure curve and an Idealized Thermodynamic Cycle. By continuously updating a Gaussian Process Regression model of the pressure's Principal Components weights using measurements of the actual operating conditions, the mean in-cylinder pressure curve as well as its uncertainty bounds are learned. This information drives the optimization of calibration parameters, which are automatically adapted while dealing with the risks and uncertainties associated with operational safety and combustion stability. This data-driven method does not require prior knowledge of the system. The proposed method is successfully demonstrated in simulation using a Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition engine model. The difference between the Gross Indicated Efficiency of the optimal solution found and the true optimum is 0.017%. For this complex engine, the optimal solution was found after 64.4s, which is relatively fast compared to conventional calibration methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables; Submitted to Control Engineering Practice's special issue on 'Bayesian optimization for data-driven modeling, optimization and control: Towards enhancing performance, efficiency, and sustainability in industrial, energy and biomedical systems'</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Modeling of Zero-Shot Classifications for Urban Flood Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14754v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Street scene datasets, collected from Street View or dashboard cameras, offer a promising means of detecting urban objects and incidents like street flooding. However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of reliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely, and ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we propose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty. First, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model on the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate large training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in urban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across locations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation zones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs provide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time periods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to baseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external predictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to improve urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at high risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic biases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More broadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations represents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large labeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing the expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.</p></details> | In review |
| **[Adaptive Local Clustering over Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20488v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a graph $G$ and a seed node $v_s$, the objective of local graph clustering (LGC) is to identify a subgraph $C_s \in G$ (a.k.a. local cluster) surrounding $v_s$ in time roughly linear with the size of $C_s$. This approach yields personalized clusters without needing to access the entire graph, which makes it highly suitable for numerous applications involving large graphs. However, most existing solutions merely rely on the topological connectivity between nodes in $G$, rendering them vulnerable to missing or noisy links that are commonly present in real-world graphs. To address this issue, this paper resorts to leveraging the complementary nature of graph topology and node attributes to enhance local clustering quality. To effectively exploit the attribute information, we first formulate the LGC as an estimation of the bidirectional diffusion distribution (BDD), which is specialized for capturing the multi-hop affinity between nodes in the presence of attributes. Furthermore, we propose LACA, an efficient and effective approach for LGC that achieves superb empirical performance on multiple real datasets while maintaining strong locality. The core components of LACA include (i) a fast and theoretically-grounded preprocessing technique for node attributes, (ii) an adaptive algorithm for diffusing any vectors over $G$ with rigorous theoretical guarantees and expedited convergence, and (iii) an effective three-step scheme for BDD approximation. Extensive experiments, comparing 17 competitors on 8 real datasets, show that LACA outperforms all competitors in terms of result quality measured against ground truth local clusters, while also being up to orders of magnitude faster.

However, existing research on 3D reconstruction using monocular neuromorphic cameras is limited, and most of the methods rely on estimating physical priors and employ complex multi-step pipelines. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method for dense voxel 3D reconstruction using neuromorphic cameras that eliminates the need to estimate physical priors. Our method incorporates a novel event representation to enhance edge features, enabling the proposed feature-enhancement model to learn more effectively. Additionally, we introduced Optimal Binarization Threshold Selection Principle as a guideline for future related work, using the optimal reconstruction results achieved with threshold optimization as the benchmark.

| **[Towards Real-World Test-Time Adaptation: Tri-Net Self-Training with Balanced Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14949v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation aims to adapt source domain model to testing data at inference stage with success demonstrated in adapting to unseen corruptions. However, these attempts may fail under more challenging real-world scenarios. Existing works mainly consider real-world test-time adaptation under non-i.i.d. data stream and continual domain shift. In this work, we first complement the existing real-world TTA protocol with a globally class imbalanced testing set. We demonstrate that combining all settings together poses new challenges to existing methods. We argue the failure of state-of-the-art methods is first caused by indiscriminately adapting normalization layers to imbalanced testing data. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose a balanced batchnorm layer to swap out the regular batchnorm at inference stage. The new batchnorm layer is capable of adapting without biasing towards majority classes. We are further inspired by the success of self-training (ST) in learning from unlabeled data and adapt ST for test-time adaptation. However, ST alone is prone to over adaption which is responsible for the poor performance under continual domain shift. Hence, we propose to improve self-training under continual domain shift by regularizing model updates with an anchored loss. The final TTA model, termed as TRIBE, is built upon a tri-net architecture with balanced batchnorm layers. We evaluate TRIBE on four datasets representing real-world TTA settings. TRIBE consistently achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation protocols.

| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19385v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Valid Conformal Prediction for Dynamic GNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19230v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs provide a flexible data abstraction for modelling many sorts of real-world systems, such as transport, trade, and social networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools allowing for different kinds of prediction and inference on these systems, but getting a handle on uncertainty, especially in dynamic settings, is a challenging problem. In this work we propose to use a dynamic graph representation known in the tensor literature as the unfolding, to achieve valid prediction sets via conformal prediction. This representation, a simple graph, can be input to any standard GNN and does not require any modification to existing GNN architectures or conformal prediction routines. One of our key contributions is a careful mathematical consideration of the different inference scenarios which can arise in a dynamic graph modelling context. For a range of practically relevant cases, we obtain valid prediction sets with almost no assumptions, even dispensing with exchangeability. In a more challenging scenario, which we call the semi-inductive regime, we achieve valid prediction under stronger assumptions, akin to stationarity. We provide real data examples demonstrating validity, showing improved accuracy over baselines, and sign-posting different failure modes which can occur when those assumptions are violated.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Scene graphs provide a suitable data representation that facilitates these applications. However, current graph-based methods for scene generation are constrained to text-based inputs and exhibit insufficient adaptability to flexible user inputs, hindering the ability to precisely control object geometry. To address this issue, we propose MMGDreamer, a dual-branch diffusion model for scene generation that incorporates a novel Mixed-Modality Graph, visual enhancement module, and relation predictor. The mixed-modality graph allows object nodes to integrate textual and visual modalities, with optional relationships between nodes. It enhances adaptability to flexible user inputs and enables meticulous control over the geometry of objects in the generated scenes. The visual enhancement module enriches the visual fidelity of text-only nodes by constructing visual representations using text embeddings. Furthermore, our relation predictor leverages node representations to infer absent relationships between nodes, resulting in more coherent scene layouts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMGDreamer exhibits superior control of object geometry, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation performance.

This research area presents a complex challenge in computer vision because of the rapid and intricate movements inherent in sign languages, which encompass hand gestures, body postures, and even facial expressions. Recently, skeleton-based action recognition has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to handle variations in subjects and backgrounds independently. However, current skeleton-based SLR methods exhibit three limitations: 1) they often neglect the importance of realistic hand poses, where most studies train SLR models on non-realistic skeletal representations; 2) they tend to assume complete data availability in both training or inference phases, and capture intricate relationships among different body parts collectively; 3) these methods treat all sign glosses uniformly, failing to account for differences in complexity levels regarding skeletal representations. To enhance the realism of hand skeletal representations, we present a kinematic hand pose rectification method for enforcing constraints. Mitigating the impact of missing data, we propose a feature-isolated mechanism to focus on capturing local spatial-temporal context. This method captures the context concurrently and independently from individual features, thus enhancing the robustness of the SLR model. Additionally, to adapt to varying complexity levels of sign glosses, we develop an input-adaptive inference approach to optimise computational efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as evidenced by achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on WLASL100 and LSA64. For WLASL100, we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 86.50\%, marking a relative improvement of 2.39% over the previous SOTA.

Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on training data (often inaccessible during online inference) and are limited to recognizing a fixed set of point cloud classes predefined during training, we explore a more practical and challenging scenario: adapting the model solely based on online test data to recognize both previously seen classes and novel, unseen classes at test time. To this end, we develop \textbf{Point-Cache}, a hierarchical cache model that captures essential clues of online test samples, particularly focusing on the global structure of point clouds and their local-part details. Point-Cache, which serves as a rich 3D knowledge base, is dynamically managed to prioritize the inclusion of high-quality samples. Designed as a plug-and-play module, our method can be flexibly integrated into large multimodal 3D models to support open-vocabulary point cloud recognition. Notably, our solution operates with efficiency comparable to zero-shot inference, as it is entirely training-free.

Due to the Markovian nature of the SGD process, inference is a challenging problem. An underlying asymptotic normality of the averaged SGD (ASGD) estimator allows for the construction of a batch-means estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Instead of the usual increasing batch-size strategy, we propose a memory efficient equal batch-size strategy and show that under mild conditions, the batch-means estimator is consistent. A key feature of the proposed batching technique is that it allows for bias-correction of the variance, at no additional cost to memory. Further, since joint inference for large dimensional problems may be undesirable, we present marginal-friendly simultaneous confidence intervals, and show through an example on how covariance estimators of ASGD can be employed for improved predictions.</p></details> | 45 pages, 8 figures |

To mitigate the sparse supervision inherent in one-to-one (O2O) matching in DETR models, DEIM employs a Dense O2O matching strategy. This approach increases the number of positive samples per image by incorporating additional targets, using standard data augmentation techniques. While Dense O2O matching speeds up convergence, it also introduces numerous low-quality matches that could affect performance. To address this, we propose the Matchability-Aware Loss (MAL), a novel loss function that optimizes matches across various quality levels, enhancing the effectiveness of Dense O2O. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset validate the efficacy of DEIM. When integrated with RT-DETR and D-FINE, it consistently boosts performance while reducing training time by 50%. Notably, paired with RT-DETRv2, DEIM achieves 53.2% AP in a single day of training on an NVIDIA 4090 GPU. Additionally, DEIM-trained real-time models outperform leading real-time object detectors, with DEIM-D-FINE-L and DEIM-D-FINE-X achieving 54.7% and 56.5% AP at 124 and 78 FPS on an NVIDIA T4 GPU, respectively, without the need for additional data.

However, the additional computational cost introduced by more model parameters hinders these methods to be deployed on resource-limited devices. To address this challenge, in this paper, we develop a style transfer framework by decoupling the style modeling and transferring. Specifically, for style modeling, we propose a style representation learning scheme to encode the style information into a compact representation. Then, for style transferring, we develop a style-aware multi-style transfer network (SaMST) to adapt to diverse styles using pluggable style representations. In this way, our framework is able to accommodate diverse image styles in the learned style representations without introducing additional overhead during inference, thereby maintaining efficiency. Experiments show that our style representation can extract accurate style information. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://manicm-fast.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[HumanDiT: Pose-Guided Diffusion Transformer for Long-form Human Motion Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04847v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agnjason.github.io/HumanDiT-page/</p></details> |

However, current LBMs simply list all concepts together as the bottleneck layer, leading to the spurious cue inference problem and cannot generalized to unseen classes. To address these limitations, we propose the Attribute-formed Language Bottleneck Model (ALBM). ALBM organizes concepts in the attribute-formed class-specific space, where concepts are descriptions of specific attributes for specific classes. In this way, ALBM can avoid the spurious cue inference problem by classifying solely based on the essential concepts of each class. In addition, the cross-class unified attribute set also ensures that the concept spaces of different classes have strong correlations, as a result, the learned concept classifier can be easily generalized to unseen classes. Moreover, to further improve interpretability, we propose Visual Attribute Prompt Learning (VAPL) to extract visual features on fine-grained attributes. Furthermore, to avoid labor-intensive concept annotation, we propose the Description, Summary, and Supplement (DSS) strategy to automatically generate high-quality concept sets with a complete and precise attribute. Extensive experiments on 9 widely used few-shot benchmarks demonstrate the interpretability, transferability, and performance of our approach. The code and collected concept sets are available at https://github.com/tiggers23/ALBM.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Socratic Planner: Self-QA-Based Zero-Shot Planning for Embodied Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15190v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is the task of executing natural language instructions by navigating and interacting with objects in interactive environments. A key challenge in EIF is compositional task planning, typically addressed through supervised learning or few-shot in-context learning with labeled data. To this end, we introduce the Socratic Planner, a self-QA-based zero-shot planning method that infers an appropriate plan without any further training. The Socratic Planner first facilitates self-questioning and answering by the Large Language Model (LLM), which in turn helps generate a sequence of subgoals. While executing the subgoals, an embodied agent may encounter unexpected situations, such as unforeseen obstacles. The Socratic Planner then adjusts plans based on dense visual feedback through a visually-grounded re-planning mechanism. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the Socratic Planner, outperforming current state-of-the-art planning models on the ALFRED benchmark across all metrics, particularly excelling in long-horizon tasks that demand complex inference. We further demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on a physical robot for long-horizon tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, published to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[MMRL: Multi-Modal Representation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08497v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential for transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, diminishing their performance on new tasks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared, learnable, and modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to text and image representation tokens, facilitating more effective multi-modal interactions. Unlike previous approaches that solely optimize class token features, MMRL integrates representation tokens at higher layers of the encoders--where dataset-specific features are more prominent--while preserving generalized knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both representation and class features are optimized, with trainable projection layer applied to the representation tokens, whereas the class token projection layer remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore, a regularization term is introduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot features from the frozen VLM, thereby safeguarding the model's generalization capacity. For inference, a decoupling strategy is employed, wherein both representation and class features are utilized for base classes, while only the class features, which retain more generalized knowledge, are used for new tasks. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a balanced trade-off between task-specific adaptation and generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/yunncheng/MMRL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning with Token Redundancy Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20282v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-efficient tuning (PET) aims to transfer pre-trained foundation models to downstream tasks by learning a small number of parameters. Compared to traditional fine-tuning, which updates the entire model, PET significantly reduces storage and transfer costs for each task regardless of exponentially increasing pre-trained model capacity. However, most PET methods inherit the inference latency of their large backbone models and often introduce additional computational overhead due to additional modules (e.g. adapters), limiting their practicality for compute-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose Faster Parameter-Efficient Tuning (FPET), a novel approach that enhances inference speed and training efficiency while maintaining high storage efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play token redundancy reduction module delicately designed for PET. This module refines tokens from the self-attention layer using an adapter to learn the accurate similarity between tokens and cuts off the tokens through a fully-differentiable token merging strategy, which uses a straight-through estimator for optimal token reduction. Experimental results prove that our FPET achieves faster inference and higher memory efficiency than the pre-trained backbone while keeping competitive performance on par with state-of-the-art PET methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Inference with Minimal Off-Chip Traffic for Transformers on Low-Power MCUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04372v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on emerging Transformer models is predicted to drive the next technology revolution in interactive wearable devices such as new-generation smart glasses. By coupling numerous sensors with small, low-power Micro-Controller Units (MCUs), these devices will enable on-device intelligence and sensor control. A major bottleneck in this class of systems is the small amount of on-chip memory available in the MCUs. In this paper, we propose a methodology to deploy real-world Transformers on low-power wearable devices with minimal off-chip traffic exploiting a distributed system of MCUs, partitioning inference across multiple devices and enabling execution with stationary on-chip weights. We validate the scheme by deploying the TinyLlama-42M decoder-only model on a system of 8 parallel ultra-low-power MCUs. The distributed system achieves an energy consumption of 0.64 mJ, a latency of 0.54 ms per inference, a super-linear speedup of 26.1 x, and an Energy Delay Product (EDP) improvement of 27.2 x, compared to a single-chip system. On MobileBERT, the distributed system's runtime is 38.8 ms, with a super-linear 4.7 x speedup when using 4 MCUs compared to a single-chip system.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to DATE 2025</p></details> |

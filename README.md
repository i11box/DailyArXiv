Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |

However, the open-source community has primarily focused on mathematics and coding while neglecting the scientific domain, largely due to the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality, verifiable scientific reasoning datasets. To bridge this gap, we first present TextbookReasoning, an open dataset featuring truthful reference answers extracted from 12k university-level scientific textbooks, comprising 650k reasoning questions spanning 7 scientific disciplines. We further introduce MegaScience, a large-scale mixture of high-quality open-source datasets totaling 1.25 million instances, developed through systematic ablation studies that evaluate various data selection methodologies to identify the optimal subset for each publicly available scientific dataset. Meanwhile, we build a comprehensive evaluation system covering diverse subjects and question types across 15 benchmarks, incorporating comprehensive answer extraction strategies to ensure accurate evaluation metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that our datasets achieve superior performance and training efficiency with more concise response lengths compared to existing open-source scientific datasets. Furthermore, we train Llama3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 series base models on MegaScience, which significantly outperform the corresponding official instruct models in average performance. In addition, MegaScience exhibits greater effectiveness for larger and stronger models, suggesting a scaling benefit for scientific tuning. We release our data curation pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and seven trained models to the community to advance scientific reasoning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages; Github: https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/MegaScience; HF: https://huggingface.co/MegaScience</p></details> |
| **[LingBench++: A Linguistically-Informed Benchmark and Reasoning Framework for Multi-Step and Cross-Cultural Inference with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16809v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LingBench++, a linguistically-informed benchmark and reasoning framework designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complex linguistic tasks inspired by the International Linguistics Olympiad (IOL). Unlike prior benchmarks that focus solely on final answer accuracy, LingBench++ provides structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and rich typological metadata across over 90 low-resource and cross-cultural languages. We further develop a multi-agent architecture integrating grammatical knowledge retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing. Through systematic comparisons of baseline and our proposed agentic models, we demonstrate that models equipped with external knowledge sources and iterative reasoning outperform single-pass approaches in both accuracy and interpretability. LingBench++ offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking LLM-Based RTL Code Optimization Via Timing Logic Metamorphosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16808v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Register Transfer Level(RTL) code optimization is crucial for achieving high performance and low power consumption in digital circuit design. However, traditional optimization methods often rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Recent studies proposed to leverage Large Language Models(LLMs) to assist in RTL code optimization. LLMs can generate optimized code snippets based on natural language descriptions, potentially speeding up the optimization process. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly evaluated the effectiveness of LLM-Based code optimization methods for RTL code with complex timing logic. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical investigation to assess the capability of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods in handling RTL code with complex timing logic. In this study, we first propose a new benchmark for RTL optimization evaluation. It comprises four subsets, each corresponding to a specific area of RTL code optimization. Then we introduce a method based on metamorphosis to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Based RTL code optimization methods.Our key insight is that the optimization effectiveness should remain consistent for semantically equivalent but more complex code. After intensive experiments, we revealed several key findings. (1) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods can effectively optimize logic operations and outperform existing compiler-based methods. (2) LLM-Based RTL optimization methods do not perform better than existing compiler-based methods on RTL code with complex timing logic, particularly in timing control flow optimization and clock domain optimization. This is primarily attributed to the challenges LLMs face in understanding timing logic in RTL code. Based on these findings, we provide insights for further research in leveraging LLMs for RTL code optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages with 9 pictures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Knowledge Transformers for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16796v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel framework for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading that integrates uncertainty-aware prediction with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), addressing a critical gap in current literature. In contrast to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient, economically efficient energy communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Proceedings of the Main Track of the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025), October 25-30, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Edge of Stochastic Stability: Revisiting the Edge of Stability for SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20553v4)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent findings by Cohen et al., 2021, demonstrate that when training neural networks with full-batch gradient descent with a step size of $\eta$, the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{\max}$ of the full-batch Hessian consistently stabilizes at $\lambda_{\max} = 2/\eta$. These results have significant implications for convergence and generalization. This, however, is not the case of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), limiting the broader applicability of its consequences. We show that SGD trains in a different regime we term Edge of Stochastic Stability (EoSS). In this regime, what stabilizes at $2/\eta$ is *Batch Sharpness*: the expected directional curvature of mini-batch Hessians along their corresponding stochastic gradients. As a consequence $\lambda_{\max}$ -- which is generally smaller than Batch Sharpness -- is suppressed, aligning with the long-standing empirical observation that smaller batches and larger step sizes favor flatter minima. We further discuss implications for mathematical modeling of SGD trajectories.</p></details> | 71 pages, 43 figures |
| **[Enhancing Domain Diversity in Synthetic Data Face Recognition with Dataset Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16790v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in recent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected through web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use of synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models typically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common limitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire synthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause overfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we propose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets generated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces model-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and demographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by emphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models trained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of these benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV Workshops 2025</p></details> |
| **[AUTOPSY: A Framework for Tackling Privacy Challenges in the Automotive Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16788v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in place, all domains have to ensure compliance with privacy legislation. However, compliance does not necessarily result in a privacy-friendly system as for example getting users' consent to process their data does not improve the privacy-friendliness of the system. Therefore, the goal of the AUTOPSY project was to support the privacy engineering process in the automotive domain by providing several building blocks which technically improve the privacy-friendliness of modern, i.e., connected and (partially) automated vehicles. This paper presents the results of the AUTOPSY project: a system model to identify relevant entities and locations to apply privacy enhancing technologies (PETs); the privacy manager aiming at more control of the data flow from the vehicle, a PET selection approach based on GDPR principles, and an architectural framework for automotive privacy. Furthermore, we built a demonstrator for location-based services to evaluate the architectural framework.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Beyond Context Limits: Subconscious Threads for Long-Horizon Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16784v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM), a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences. The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.</p></details> | Research preview |
| **[Task-Specific Zero-shot Quantization-Aware Training for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16782v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational complexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision. Traditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data, which is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges. Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated from pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently, ZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use unlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information required for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection networks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box and category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set from the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and category distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate task-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the performance of quantized detection networks. Extensive experiments conducted on the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets demonstrate the efficiency and state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/DFQ-Dojo/dfq-toolkit .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cooling Matters: Benchmarking Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models on Liquid-Cooled Versus Air-Cooled H100 GPU Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16781v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unprecedented growth in artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, recently dominated by large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), has intensified power and cooling demands in data centers. This study benchmarks LLMs and VLMs on two HGX nodes, each with 8x NVIDIA H100 graphics processing units (GPUs), using liquid and air cooling. Leveraging GPU Burn, Weights and Biases, and IPMItool, we collect detailed thermal, power, and computation data. Results show that the liquid-cooled systems maintain GPU temperatures between 41-50 degrees Celsius, while the air-cooled counterparts fluctuate between 54-72 degrees Celsius under load. This thermal stability of liquid-cooled systems yields 17 percent higher performance (54 TFLOPs per GPU vs. 46 TFLOPs per GPU), improved performance per watt, reduced energy overhead, and greater system efficiency than the air-cooled counterparts. These findings underscore the energy and sustainability benefits of liquid cooling, offering a compelling path forward for hyperscale data centers s</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Improving U-Net Confidence on TEM Image Data with L2-Regularization, Transfer Learning, and Deep Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16779v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for natural images. We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization, semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate, which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into the ICCV 2025 CV4MS Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Can we have it all? Non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact confidence intervals for expectations and linear regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16776v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We contribute to bridging the gap between large- and finite-sample inference by studying confidence sets (CSs) that are both non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact uniformly (NAVAE) over semi-parametric statistical models. NAVAE CSs are not easily obtained; for instance, we show they do not exist over the set of Bernoulli distributions. We first derive a generic sufficient condition: NAVAE CSs are available as soon as uniform asymptotically exact CSs are. Second, building on that connection, we construct closed-form NAVAE confidence intervals (CIs) in two standard settings -- scalar expectations and linear combinations of OLS coefficients -- under moment conditions only. For expectations, our sole requirement is a bounded kurtosis. In the OLS case, our moment constraints accommodate heteroskedasticity and weak exogeneity of the regressors. Under those conditions, we enlarge the Central Limit Theorem-based CIs, which are asymptotically exact, to ensure non-asymptotic guarantees. Those modifications vanish asymptotically so that our CIs coincide with the classical ones in the limit. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our approach through a simulation study.</p></details> | 69 pages |
| **[RadAlign: Advancing Radiology Report Generation with Vision-Language Concept Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07525v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated chest radiographs interpretation requires both accurate disease classification and detailed radiology report generation, presenting a significant challenge in the clinical workflow. Current approaches either focus on classification accuracy at the expense of interpretability or generate detailed but potentially unreliable reports through image captioning techniques. In this study, we present RadAlign, a novel framework that combines the predictive accuracy of vision-language models (VLMs) with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the radiologist's workflow, RadAlign first employs a specialized VLM to align visual features with key medical concepts, achieving superior disease classification with an average AUC of 0.885 across multiple diseases. These recognized medical conditions, represented as text-based concepts in the aligned visual-language space, are then used to prompt LLM-based report generation. Enhanced by a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that grounds outputs in similar historical cases, RadAlign delivers superior report quality with a GREEN score of 0.678, outperforming state-of-the-art methods' 0.634. Our framework maintains strong clinical interpretability while reducing hallucinations, advancing automated medical imaging and report analysis through integrated predictive and generative AI.

| **[VRU-Accident: A Vision-Language Benchmark for Video Question Answering and Dense Captioning for Accident Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09815v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists, is a critical challenge for autonomous driving systems, as crashes involving VRUs often result in severe or fatal consequences. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in enhancing scene understanding and decision making in autonomous vehicles, there is currently no standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate their reasoning abilities in complex, safety-critical scenarios involving VRUs. To address this gap, we present VRU-Accident, a large-scale vision-language benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in high-risk traffic scenarios involving VRUs. VRU-Accident comprises 1K real-world dashcam accident videos, annotated with 6K multiple-choice question-answer pairs across six safety-critical categories (with 24K candidate options and 3.4K unique answer choices), as well as 1K dense scene descriptions. Unlike prior works, our benchmark focuses explicitly on VRU-vehicle accidents, providing rich, fine-grained annotations that capture both spatial-temporal dynamics and causal semantics of accidents. To assess the current landscape of MLLMs, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models on the multiple-choice VQA task and on the dense captioning task. Our findings reveal that while MLLMs perform reasonably well on visually grounded attributes, they face significant challenges in reasoning and describing accident causes, types, and preventability.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Learning novel representations of variable sources from multi-modal $\textit{Gaia}$ data via autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16320v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry, BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4 million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE), which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks, including classification, clustering and outlier detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted on Astronomy & Astrophysics, 20 pages, 20 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Adaptive World Models in Machines with Novel Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12821v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this class of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |

Contrasting with existing two-stage methods that follow a sequential ``edge point cloud reconstruction and parametric curve fitting'' pipeline, our one-stage approach optimizes 3D parametric curves directly from 2D edge maps, eliminating error accumulation caused by the inherent optimization gap between disconnected stages. However, parametric curves inherently lack suitability for rendering-based multi-view optimization, necessitating a complementary representation that preserves their geometric properties while enabling differentiable rendering. We propose a novel bi-directional coupling mechanism between parametric curves and edge-oriented Gaussian components. This tight correspondence formulates a curve-aware Gaussian representation, \textbf{CurveGaussian}, that enables differentiable rendering of 3D curves, allowing direct optimization guided by multi-view evidence. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamically adaptive topology optimization framework during training to refine curve structures through linearization, merging, splitting, and pruning operations. Comprehensive evaluations on the ABC dataset and real-world benchmarks demonstrate our one-stage method's superiority over two-stage alternatives, particularly in producing cleaner and more robust reconstructions. Additionally, by directly optimizing parametric curves, our method significantly reduces the parameter count during training, achieving both higher efficiency and superior performance compared to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, Code: https://github.com/zhirui-gao/Curve-Gaussian</p></details> |
| **[CMP: A Composable Meta Prompt for SAM-Based Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16753v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) remains challenging due to limited data and domain shifts. Recent foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges: reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.</p></details> | 3 figures |
| **[Bootstrapped Control Limits for Score-Based Concept Drift Control Charts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16749v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring for changes in a predictive relationship represented by a fitted supervised learning model (aka concept drift detection) is a widespread problem, e.g., for retrospective analysis to determine whether the predictive relationship was stable over the training data, for prospective analysis to determine when it is time to update the predictive model, for quality control of processes whose behavior can be characterized by a predictive relationship, etc. A general and powerful Fisher score-based concept drift approach has recently been proposed, in which concept drift detection reduces to detecting changes in the mean of the model's score vector using a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA). To implement the approach, the initial data must be split into two subsets. The first subset serves as the training sample to which the model is fit, and the second subset serves as an out-of-sample test set from which the MEWMA control limit (CL) is determined. In this paper, we develop a novel bootstrap procedure for computing the CL. Our bootstrap CL provides much more accurate control of false-alarm rate, especially when the sample size and/or false-alarm rate is small. It also allows the entire initial sample to be used for training, resulting in a more accurate fitted supervised learning model. We show that a standard nested bootstrap (inner loop accounting for future data variability and outer loop accounting for training sample variability) substantially underestimates variability and develop a 632-like correction that appropriately accounts for this. We demonstrate the advantages with numerical examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures; submitted to Technometrics</p></details> |

Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>datas...</summary><p>dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/multimodal-reasoning-lab/Zebra-CoT</p></details> |

However, obtaining clean and complete point clouds from real-world environments is challenging due to noise and occlusions. Consequently, most existing completion networks -- trained on synthetic data -- struggle with real-world degradations. In this work, we tackle the problem of completing and denoising highly corrupted partial point clouds affected by multiple simultaneous degradations. To benchmark robustness, we introduce the Corrupted Point Cloud Completion Dataset (CPCCD), which highlights the limitations of current methods under diverse corruptions. Building on these insights, we propose DWCNet (Denoising-While-Completing Network), a completion framework enhanced with a Noise Management Module (NMM) that leverages contrastive learning and self-attention to suppress noise and model structural relationships. DWCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both clean and corrupted, synthetic and real-world datasets.

Addressing these challenges requires architectures that are robust to the unique complexities posed by medical imaging data. Rapid advancements in vision-language foundation models within the natural image domain prompt the question of how they can be adapted for medical imaging tasks. In this work, we present PRISM, a framework that leverages foundation models to generate high-resolution, language-guided medical image counterfactuals using Stable Diffusion. Our approach demonstrates unprecedented precision in selectively modifying spurious correlations (the medical devices) and disease features, enabling the removal and addition of specific attributes while preserving other image characteristics. Through extensive evaluation, we show how PRISM advances counterfactual generation and enables the development of more robust downstream classifiers for clinically deployable solutions. To facilitate broader adoption and research, we make our code publicly available at https://github.com/Amarkr1/PRISM.</p></details> | MIDL 2025 |

Equivalently, this shows that determining the optimal success probability for encoding a bit in a quantum system undergoing noise is NP-hard. This contrasts with the classical analogue of this problem that can clearly by solved efficiently. Our hardness results also hold for deciding if the contraction coefficient is equal to 1. As a consequence, we show that deciding if a non-commutative graph has an independence number of at least 2 is NP-hard. In addition, we establish a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programming upper bounds on the contraction coefficient.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |

While existing approaches primarily rely on visual support samples or textual descriptions, their single or dual-modal paradigms limit exploitation of rich perceptual information available in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, the proposed approach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate visual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The DFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a hierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via SAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes audio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a fusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across visual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic interactions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path Reconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from tri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors. Extensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both synthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 3 figures |

However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with stronger temporal reasoning abilities.

This survey explores a collaborative paradigm in which cloud-based LLMs and edge-deployed small language models (SLMs) cooperate across both inference and training. We present a unified taxonomy of edge-cloud collaboration strategies. For inference, we categorize approaches into task assignment, task division, and mixture-based collaboration at both task and token granularity, encompassing adaptive scheduling, resource-aware offloading, speculative decoding, and modular routing. For training, we review distributed adaptation techniques, including parameter alignment, pruning, bidirectional distillation, and small-model-guided optimization. We further summarize datasets, benchmarks, and deployment cases, and highlight privacy-preserving methods and vertical applications.

With recent advancements in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modelling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver to the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input. We evaluated RIIR extensively on brain MRI and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only $5\%$ of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning. Our proposed RIIR offers a highly data-efficient framework for deep learning-based medical image registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

However, existing audio-language models struggle with processing spatial audio and perceiving spatial acoustic scenes. We introduce the Spatial Audio Language Model (SALM), a novel framework that bridges spatial audio and language via multi-modal contrastive learning. SALM consists of a text encoder and a dual-branch audio encoder, decomposing spatial sound into semantic and spatial components through structured audio embeddings. Key features of SALM include seamless alignment of spatial and text representations, separate and joint extraction of spatial and semantic information, zero-shot direction classification and robust support for spatial audio editing. Experimental results demonstrate that SALM effectively captures and aligns cross-modal representations. Furthermore, it supports advanced editing capabilities, such as altering directional audio using text-based embeddings.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo.

| **[Enhancing Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models Through MLLM and LLM-Based High-Quality Image-Text Dataset Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16716v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote sensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior capability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several works introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs. However, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the quality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data, while only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for generating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate distinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using Rule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs generation methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate these diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from multiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset, including about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two VLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an image-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP and RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed the previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only 4.2\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches across benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or even exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be released at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>SUBMI...</summary><p>SUBMIT TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS</p></details> |

In contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%, which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables.

Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jasper0314-huang.github.io/thinkact-vla/</p></details> |

In contrast to previous works relying on deterministic forecasts, the proposed approach employs a heteroscedastic probabilistic transformer-based prediction model called Knowledge Transformer with Uncertainty (KTU) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty, which is essential for robust decision-making in the stochastic environment of P2P energy trading. The KTU model leverages domain-specific features and is trained with a custom loss function that ensures reliable probabilistic forecasts and confidence intervals for each prediction. Integrating these uncertainty-aware forecasts into the MARL framework enables agents to optimize trading strategies with a clear understanding of risk and variability. Experimental results show that the uncertainty-aware Deep Q-Network (DQN) reduces energy purchase costs by up to 5.7% without P2P trading and 3.2% with P2P trading, while increasing electricity sales revenue by 6.4% and 44.7%, respectively. Additionally, peak hour grid demand is reduced by 38.8% without P2P and 45.6% with P2P. These improvements are even more pronounced when P2P trading is enabled, highlighting the synergy between advanced forecasting and market mechanisms for resilient, economically efficient energy communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Proceedings of the Main Track of the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2025), October 25-30, 2025</p></details> |

This extensive dataset offers a unique opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4 million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE), which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks, including classification, clustering and outlier detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted on Astronomy & Astrophysics, 20 pages, 20 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recent foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown remarkable zero-shot generalization capability in general segmentation tasks, making it a promising solution for few-shot scenarios. However, adapting SAM to CD-FSS faces two critical challenges: reliance on manual prompt and limited cross-domain ability. Therefore, we propose the Composable Meta-Prompt (CMP) framework that introduces three key modules: (i) the Reference Complement and Transformation (RCT) module for semantic expansion, (ii) the Composable Meta-Prompt Generation (CMPG) module for automated meta-prompt synthesis, and (iii) the Frequency-Aware Interaction (FAI) module for domain discrepancy mitigation. Evaluations across four cross-domain datasets demonstrate CMP's state-of-the-art performance, achieving 71.8\% and 74.5\% mIoU in 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios respectively.</p></details> | 3 figures |

However, when devices rely on different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proc....</summary><p>Proc. of IEEE IJCNN 2025</p></details> |

A major challenge in these accelerators is efficiently detecting errors caused by random hardware faults. Traditional algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) techniques verify individual matrix multiplications but fall short in handling the full attention mechanism, particularly due to intermediate softmax normalization.

This approach significantly reduces overhead by eliminating redundant checks while maintaining high fault-detection accuracy.

We present DOFA-CLIP (Dynamic-One-For-All CLIP), a unified vision-language foundation model that dynamically adapts to EO modalities with flexible spectral configurations through a single Transformer backbone. Our approach introduces three key contributions: 1) the construction of GeoLangBind-2M, a large-scale EO image-text dataset covering six heterogeneous modalities with rich natural language descriptions; 2) a novel training strategy called VECT (Vision-models Enhanced Contrastive Text-image pretraining), which enhances the spatial awareness of CLIP features with multiple vision foundation models; and 3) a Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module that refines feature distillation with modality-specific awareness. DOFA-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across a wide range of EO benchmarks, including unseen modalities and a diverse number of input spectral bands.

AI-driven solutions have made inroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages from financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting standards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall short in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific legal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance across different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on comparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their proprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis leverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model demonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true negative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless, proprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of scenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published at BigData 2023, 10 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models. This work provides a practical solution for deploying advanced language models in resource-constrained medical environments, enabling broader accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare.</p></details> | 14 pages, 1 figures |

Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces 'FST.ai' -- which is developed under the 'R3AL.ai' project, which serves as its Principal Investigator: r3al.ai -- a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation, motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and sport-agnostic potential of 'FST.ai' to transform officiating standards across multiple disciplines.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

Recent studies integrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local details and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are limited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any interaction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer and Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing A2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a new token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model (MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an attention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of cross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the multi-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a two-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of SSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks. For instance, A2Mamba-L achieves an impressive 86.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. In semantic segmentation, A2Mamba-B exceeds CAFormer-S36 by 2.5% in mIoU, while exhibiting higher efficiency. In object detection and instance segmentation with Cascade Mask R-CNN, A2Mamba-S surpasses MambaVision-B by 1.2%/0.9% in AP^b/AP^m, while having 40% less parameters.

While existing studies primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast, Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations, maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the model's expressive capacity. To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1) layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2) low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and (3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method, LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].</p></details> | 17 pages,18 figures |

We propose Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory (UCCT), a unified model that reinterprets LLMs as unconscious substrates requiring external mechanisms, few-shot prompting, RAG, fine-tuning, and multi-agent reasoning, to semantically anchor latent representations. UCCT formalizes this anchoring process through a Bayesian formulation, revealing a threshold-crossing dynamic characterized by 1/sqrt(n) scaling that explains the sudden capability transitions observed across diverse tasks. The theory unifies previously disparate techniques, few-shot prompting, RAG, fine-tuning, and multi-agent reasoning, as special cases of a general anchoring architecture. Through case studies in simple math, visual recognition, and structured debate tasks, we confirm the predictive power of UCCT. Furthermore, our experiment in arithmetic in three numeral systems validates the theories of UCCT. Rather than treating intelligence as an intrinsic property of LLMs, UCCT demonstrates that LLMs are merely unconscious pattern repositories with no inherent intelligence. Intelligence emerges only when external anchoring mechanisms assign target semantics to these latent patterns, transforming unconscious representations into conscious, goal-directed capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figure, 2 table</p></details> |

By implementing a global exception hook architecture with pyttsx3 text-to-speech conversion and Tkinter-based GUI visualization, the solution delivers multimodal error feedback through parallel auditory and visual channels. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 37% reduced cognitive load (p<0.01, n=50) compared to traditional stack-trace debugging, while enabling 78% faster error identification through vocalized exception classification and contextualization. The system achieves sub-1.2 second voice latency with under 18% CPU overhead during exception handling, vocalizing error types and consequences while displaying interactive tracebacks with documentation deep links. Criteria validate compatibility across Python 3.7+ environments on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Needing only two lines of integration code, the plugin significantly boosts availability for aesthetically impaired designers and supports multitasking workflows through hands-free error medical diagnosis. Educational applications show particular promise, with pilot studies indicating 45% faster debugging skill acquisition among novice programmers. Future development will incorporate GPT-based repair suggestions and real-time multilingual translation to further advance auditory debugging paradigms. The solution represents a fundamental shift toward human-centric error diagnostics, bridging critical gaps in programming accessibility while establishing new standards for cognitive efficiency in software development workflows.</p></details> | 35 pages, 20 figures |
| **[Physically Consistent Image Augmentation for Deep Learning in Mueller Matrix Polarimetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07918v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mueller matrix polarimetry captures essential information about polarized light interactions with a sample, presenting unique challenges for data augmentation in deep learning due to its distinct structure. While augmentations are an effective and affordable way to enhance dataset diversity and reduce overfitting, standard transformations like rotations and flips do not preserve the polarization properties in Mueller matrix images. To this end, we introduce a versatile simulation framework that applies physically consistent rotations and flips to Mueller matrices, tailored to maintain polarization fidelity. Our experimental results across multiple datasets reveal that conventional augmentations can lead to falsified results when applied to polarimetric data, underscoring the necessity of our physics-based approach. In our experiments, we first compare our polarization-specific augmentations against real-world captures to validate their physical consistency. We then apply these augmentations in a semantic segmentation task, achieving substantial improvements in model generalization and performance. This study underscores the necessity of physics-informed data augmentation for polarimetric imaging in deep learning (DL), paving the way for broader adoption and more robust applications across diverse research in the field. In particular, our framework unlocks the potential of DL models for polarimetric datasets with limited sample sizes.

However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: \textbf{Motion-Condition-Motion}, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, \textbf{MotionLab}, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

With powerful text-to-image diffusion models, existing methods directly design the overall geometry and texture of input character, making it challenging to ensure both creativity and legibility. In this paper, we introduce a dual-branch, training-free method called VitaGlyph, enabling flexible artistic typography with controllable geometry changes while maintaining the readability. The key insight of VitaGlyph is to treat input character as a scene composed of a Subject and its Surrounding, which are rendered with varying degrees of geometric transformation. To enhance the visual appeal and creativity of the generated artistic typography, the subject flexibly expresses the essential concept of the input character, while the surrounding enriches relevant background without altering the shape, thus maintaining overall readability. Specifically, we implement VitaGlyph through a three-phase framework: (i) Knowledge Acquisition leverages large language models to design text descriptions for the subject and surrounding. (ii) Regional Interpretation detects the part that most closely matches the subject description and refines the structure via Semantic Typography. (iii) Attentional Compositional Generation separately renders the textures of the Subject and Surrounding regions and blends them in an attention-based manner. Experimental results demonstrate that VitaGlyph not only achieves better artistry and readability but also manages to depict multiple customized concepts, facilitating more creative and pleasing artistic typography generation. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Carlofkl/VitaGlyph</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource binaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control. First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times, resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality and spatial perceptual accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages,3 figures,2 tables</p></details> |

However, most existing 3D multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) rely on compressing holistic 3D scene information or segmenting independent objects to perform these tasks, which limits their spatial awareness due to insufficient representation of the richness inherent in 3D scenes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatial 3D-LLM, a 3D MLLM specifically designed to enhance spatial awareness for 3D vision-language tasks by enriching the spatial embeddings of 3D scenes. Spatial 3D-LLM integrates an LLM backbone with a progressive spatial awareness scheme that progressively captures spatial information as the perception field expands, generating location-enriched 3D scene embeddings to serve as visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce two novel tasks: 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing, and construct a 3D instruction dataset, MODEL, to evaluate the model's spatial awareness capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that Spatial 3D-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of 3D vision-language tasks, revealing the improvements stemmed from our progressive spatial awareness scheme of mining more profound spatial information.

However, conventional RISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely attenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures, capable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter investigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active RISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single Power Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell level using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive mathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received signal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are derived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and amplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints. Regarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit cell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the derivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model. Furthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection coefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations, enabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can effectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE trade-offs compared to passive RISs. Finally, the trade-off between the available power budget and the number of active elements is examined, revealing that a higher number of active elements does not always lead to optimal performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 15 figures, Book chapter</p></details> |

It utilizes a 4D Gaussian representation and a GPU-friendly rasterizer, enabling rapid rendering speeds. Despite its advantages, 4DGS faces significant challenges, notably the requirement of millions of 4D Gaussians, each with extensive associated attributes, leading to substantial memory and storage cost. This paper introduces a memory-efficient framework for 4DGS. We streamline the color attribute by decomposing it into a per-Gaussian direct color component with only 3 parameters and a shared lightweight alternating current color predictor. This approach eliminates the need for spherical harmonics coefficients, which typically involve up to 144 parameters in classic 4DGS, thereby creating a memory-efficient 4D Gaussian representation. Furthermore, we introduce an entropy-constrained Gaussian deformation technique that uses a deformation field to expand the action range of each Gaussian and integrates an opacity-based entropy loss to limit the number of Gaussians, thus forcing our model to use as few Gaussians as possible to fit a dynamic scene well. With simple half-precision storage and zip compression, our framework achieves a storage reduction by approximately 190$\times$ and 125$\times$ on the Technicolor and Neural 3D Video datasets, respectively, compared to the original 4DGS. Meanwhile, it maintains comparable rendering speeds and scene representation quality, setting a new standard in the field.

This shift significantly increases throughput and transactions per second (TPS), while ensuring conflict-free execution in both proposer and attestor modes and preserving execution order consistency in the attestor. At the heart of Conthereum is a novel, lightweight, high-performance scheduler inspired by the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSS). We propose a custom greedy heuristic algorithm, along with its efficient implementation, that solves this formulation effectively and decisively outperforms existing scheduling methods in finding suboptimal solutions that satisfy the constraints, achieve minimal makespan, and maximize speedup in parallel execution. Additionally, Conthereum includes an offline phase that equips its real-time scheduler with a conflict analysis repository obtained through static analysis of smart contracts, identifying potentially conflicting functions using a pessimistic approach. Building on this novel scheduler and extensive conflict data, Conthereum outperforms existing concurrent intra-block solutions. Empirical evaluations show near-linear throughput gains with increasing computational power on standard 8-core machines. Although scalability deviates from linear with higher core counts and increased transaction conflicts, Conthereum still significantly improves upon the current sequential execution model and outperforms existing concurrent solutions under a wide range of conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures, 1 algorithms</p></details> |

Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://rookiexiong7.github.io/projects/SeC/ ; code: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC ; dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS</p></details> |

However, we observe that pruning often leads to a degradation in safety performance. To address this issue, we present a novel and lightweight approach, termed Hierarchical Safety Realignment (HSR). HSR operates by first quantifying the contribution of each attention head to safety, identifying the most critical ones, and then selectively restoring neurons directly within these attention heads that play a pivotal role in maintaining safety. This process hierarchically realigns the safety of pruned LVLMs, progressing from the attention head level to the neuron level. We validate HSR across various models and pruning strategies, consistently achieving notable improvements in safety performance. To our knowledge, this is the first work explicitly focused on restoring safety in LVLMs post-pruning.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

By producing artificial but task-relevant examples, these models can significantly augment or even substitute for real-world datasets, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce, expensive, or sensitive. This paper surveys recent advances in leveraging LLMs to create synthetic text and code, highlighting key techniques such as prompt-based generation, retrieval-augmented pipelines, and iterative self-refinement. We examine how these methods can enrich low-resource tasks (e.g., classification, question answering) and facilitate code-centric applications (e.g., instruction tuning, code translation, bug repair) through automated verification of functional correctness. Alongside potential benefits - cost-effectiveness, broad coverage, and controllable diversity - we discuss the accompanying challenges, including factual inaccuracies in generated text, insufficient stylistic or distributional realism, and risks of bias amplification. Proposed mitigation strategies range from filtering and weighting synthetic outputs to reinforcement learning with execution feedback in code domains. We conclude by outlining open research directions, such as automated prompt engineering, cross-modal data synthesis, and robust evaluation frameworks, underscoring the growing importance of LLM-generated synthetic data in accelerating AI development while emphasizing ethical and quality safeguards.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure, 64 references</p></details> |

This paper extends this adaptive label smoothing framework to other types of aggressive augmentations beyond random-crop. Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for random erasing and noise injection data augmentation. Adaptive label smoothing permits stronger regularization via higher-intensity Random Erasing. However, its benefits vanish when applied with a diverse range of image transformations as in the state-of-the-art TrivialAugment method, and excessive label smoothing harms robustness to common corruptions. Our findings suggest that adaptive label smoothing should only be applied when the training data distribution is dominated by a limited, homogeneous set of image transformation types.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Fast Review Track of DAGM German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR) 2025</p></details> |

Considering the limited computational resources of edge devices, developing a low-complexity, end-to-end integrated network for both correction and recognition is essential for achieving real-time and efficient deployment. In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network named LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which combines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized license plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the recognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the correction process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To enhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet, including an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar characters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during training. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of LPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line license plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various challenging scenarios. Moreover, on lower-mid-range GPUs platform, the method runs in less than 10 milliseconds, indicating its practical efficiency and broad applicability.</p></details> | 28 pages, 33 figures |
| **[Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network for Attributed Graph Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13620v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality. Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues, its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The source code for this study is available at https://github.com/YF-W/Tri-GFN</p></details> |
| **[Attention-Based Fusion of IQ and FFT Spectrograms with AoA Features for GNSS Jammer Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14167v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |

While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization. CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance. The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deepreinforce-ai.github.io/cudal1_blog/</p></details> |

While machine learning (ML)-based classifiers have shown promise in detecting malicious call transcripts, they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations that preserve semantic content. In this study, we explore a novel attack vector where large language models (LLMs) are leveraged to generate adversarial vishing transcripts that evade detection while maintaining deceptive intent. We construct a systematic attack pipeline that employs prompt engineering and semantic obfuscation to transform real-world vishing scripts using four commercial LLMs. The generated transcripts are evaluated against multiple ML classifiers trained on a real-world Korean vishing dataset (KorCCViD) with statistical testing. Our experiments reveal that LLM-generated transcripts are both practically and statistically effective against ML-based classifiers. In particular, transcripts crafted by GPT-4o significantly reduce classifier accuracy (by up to 30.96%) while maintaining high semantic similarity, as measured by BERTScore. Moreover, these attacks are both time-efficient and cost-effective, with average generation times under 9 seconds and negligible financial cost per query. The results underscore the pressing need for more resilient vishing detection frameworks and highlight the imperative for LLM providers to enforce stronger safeguards against prompt misuse in adversarial social engineering contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EAI ICDF2C 2025</p></details> |

Yet common evaluation protocols for sequential recommendations remain insufficiently developed: they often fail to reflect the corresponding recommendation task accurately, or are not aligned with real-world scenarios. Although the widely used leave-one-out split matches next-item prediction, it permits the overlap between training and test periods, which leads to temporal leakage and unrealistically long test horizon, limiting real-world relevance. Global temporal splitting addresses these issues by evaluating on distinct future periods. However, its applications to sequential recommendations remain loosely defined, particularly in terms of selecting target interactions and constructing a validation subset that provides necessary consistency between validation and test metrics. In this paper, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes can vary significantly across splitting strategies, influencing model rankings and practical deployment decisions. To improve reproducibility in both academic and industrial settings, we systematically compare different splitting strategies for sequential recommendations across multiple datasets and established baselines. Our findings show that prevalent splits, such as leave-one-out, may be insufficiently aligned with more realistic evaluation strategies.

| **[Longest Unbordered Factors on Run-Length Encoded Strings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16285v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A border of a string is a non-empty proper prefix of the string that is also a suffix. A string is unbordered if it has no border. The longest unbordered factor is a fundamental notion in stringology, closely related to string periodicity. This paper addresses the longest unbordered factor problem: given a string of length $n$, the goal is to compute its longest factor that is unbordered. While recent work has achieved subquadratic and near-linear time algorithms for this problem, the best known worst-case time complexity remains $O(n \log n)$ [Kociumaka et al., ISAAC 2018]. In this paper, we investigate the problem in the context of compressed string processing, particularly focusing on run-length encoded (RLE) strings. We first present a simple yet crucial structural observation relating unbordered factors and RLE-compressed strings. Building on this, we propose an algorithm that solves the problem in $O(m^{1.5} \log^2 m)$ time and $O(m \log^2 m)$ space, where $m$ is the size of the RLE-compressed input string. To achieve this, our approach simulates a key idea from the $O(n^{1.5})$-time algorithm by [Gawrychowski et al., SPIRE 2015], adapting it to the RLE setting through new combinatorial insights. When the RLE size $m$ is sufficiently small compared to $n$, our algorithm may show linear-time behavior in $n$, potentially leading to improved performance over existing methods in such cases.</p></details> | SPIRE 2025 |

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus solely on final answer accuracy, LingBench++ provides structured reasoning traces, stepwise evaluation protocols, and rich typological metadata across over 90 low-resource and cross-cultural languages. We further develop a multi-agent architecture integrating grammatical knowledge retrieval, tool-augmented reasoning, and deliberate hypothesis testing. Through systematic comparisons of baseline and our proposed agentic models, we demonstrate that models equipped with external knowledge sources and iterative reasoning outperform single-pass approaches in both accuracy and interpretability. LingBench++ offers a comprehensive foundation for advancing linguistically grounded, culturally informed, and cognitively plausible reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 17 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Context Limits: Subconscious Threads for Long-Horizon Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16784v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To break the context limits of large language models (LLMs) that bottleneck reasoning accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Thread Inference Model (TIM), a family of LLMs trained for recursive and decompositional problem solving, and TIMRUN, an inference runtime enabling long-horizon structured reasoning beyond context limits. Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences. The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.</p></details> | Research preview |

Non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact confidence intervals for expectations and linear regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16776v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We contribute to bridging the gap between large- and finite-sample inference by studying confidence sets (CSs) that are both non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact uniformly (NAVAE) over semi-parametric statistical models. NAVAE CSs are not easily obtained; for instance, we show they do not exist over the set of Bernoulli distributions. We first derive a generic sufficient condition: NAVAE CSs are available as soon as uniform asymptotically exact CSs are. Second, building on that connection, we construct closed-form NAVAE confidence intervals (CIs) in two standard settings -- scalar expectations and linear combinations of OLS coefficients -- under moment conditions only. For expectations, our sole requirement is a bounded kurtosis. In the OLS case, our moment constraints accommodate heteroskedasticity and weak exogeneity of the regressors. Under those conditions, we enlarge the Central Limit Theorem-based CIs, which are asymptotically exact, to ensure non-asymptotic guarantees. Those modifications vanish asymptotically so that our CIs coincide with the classical ones in the limit. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our approach through a simulation study.</p></details> | 69 pages |

While nominally valid in the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation challenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More importantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The numerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need for their optimal placement.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, book chapter</p></details> |

Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>datas...</summary><p>dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/multimodal-reasoning-lab/Zebra-CoT</p></details> |

However, despite extensive benchmarking efforts, it remains unclear whether current Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) effectively capture core temporal patterns such as periodicity, cause-and-effect, and long-range dependencies. In this work, we introduce the Temporal Graph Reasoning Benchmark (T-GRAB), a comprehensive set of synthetic tasks designed to systematically probe the capabilities of TGNNs to reason across time. T-GRAB provides controlled, interpretable tasks that isolate key temporal skills: counting/memorizing periodic repetitions, inferring delayed causal effects, and capturing long-range dependencies over both spatial and temporal dimensions. We evaluate 11 temporal graph learning methods on these tasks, revealing fundamental shortcomings in their ability to generalize temporal patterns. Our findings offer actionable insights into the limitations of current models, highlight challenges hidden by traditional real-world benchmarks, and motivate the development of architectures with stronger temporal reasoning abilities.

This survey explores a collaborative paradigm in which cloud-based LLMs and edge-deployed small language models (SLMs) cooperate across both inference and training. We present a unified taxonomy of edge-cloud collaboration strategies. For inference, we categorize approaches into task assignment, task division, and mixture-based collaboration at both task and token granularity, encompassing adaptive scheduling, resource-aware offloading, speculative decoding, and modular routing. For training, we review distributed adaptation techniques, including parameter alignment, pruning, bidirectional distillation, and small-model-guided optimization. We further summarize datasets, benchmarks, and deployment cases, and highlight privacy-preserving methods and vertical applications. This survey provides the first systematic foundation for LLM-SLM collaboration, bridging system and algorithm co-design to enable efficient, scalable, and trustworthy edge-cloud intelligence.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Recurrent Inference Machine for Medical Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13413v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration is essential for medical image applications where alignment of voxels across multiple images is needed for qualitative or quantitative analysis. With recent advancements in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modelling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver to the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input. We evaluated RIIR extensively on brain MRI and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only $5\%$ of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning. Our proposed RIIR offers a highly data-efficient framework for deep learning-based medical image registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version.

If the party orders of candidates in races with and without party designations differ, these voters might cast their votes incorrectly. We identify a quasi-randomized natural experiment with contest-level treatment assignment pertaining to North Carolina judicial elections and use double machine learning to accurately capture the magnitude of such incorrectly cast votes. Using precinct-level election and demographic data, we estimate that 11.8% (95% confidence interval: [4.0%, 19.6%]) of democratic partisan voters and 15.4% (95% confidence interval: [7.8%, 23.1%]) of republican partisan voters cast their votes incorrectly due to the difference in party orders. Our results indicate that ballots mixing contests with and without party designations mislead many voters, leading to outcomes that do not reflect true voter preferences. To accurately capture voter intent, such ballot designs should be avoided.</p></details> | 27 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Learning Causally Predictable Outcomes from Psychiatric Longitudinal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16629v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal inference in longitudinal biomedical data remains a central challenge, especially in psychiatry, where symptom heterogeneity and latent confounding frequently undermine classical estimators. Most existing methods for treatment effect estimation presuppose a fixed outcome variable and address confounding through observed covariate adjustment. However, the assumption of unconfoundedness may not hold for a fixed outcome in practice. To address this foundational limitation, we directly optimize the outcome definition to maximize causal identifiability. Our DEBIAS (Durable Effects with Backdoor-Invariant Aggregated Symptoms) algorithm learns non-negative, clinically interpretable weights for outcome aggregation, maximizing durable treatment effects and empirically minimizing both observed and latent confounding by leveraging the time-limited direct effects of prior treatments in psychiatric longitudinal data. The algorithm also furnishes an empirically verifiable test for outcome unconfoundedness. DEBIAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovering causal effects for clinically interpretable composite outcomes across comprehensive experiments in depression and schizophrenia.</p></details> | <details><summary>R cod...</summary><p>R code is available at github.com/ericstrobl/DEBIAS</p></details> |

Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has demonstrated remarkable advancements in both image and video segmentation. However, the inherent limitations of SAM2's greedy selection memory design are amplified by the unique properties of surgical videos-rapid instrument movement, frequent occlusion, and complex instrument-tissue interaction-resulting in diminished performance in the segmentation of complex, long videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Memory Augmented (MA)-SAM2, a training-free video object segmentation strategy, featuring novel context-aware and occlusion-resilient memory models. MA-SAM2 exhibits strong robustness against occlusions and interactions arising from complex instrument movements while maintaining accuracy in segmenting objects throughout videos. Employing a multi-target, single-loop, one-prompt inference further enhances the efficiency of the tracking process in multi-instrument videos. Without introducing any additional parameters or requiring further training, MA-SAM2 achieved performance improvements of 4.36% and 6.1% over SAM2 on the EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 datasets, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical surgical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents an efficient lightweight medical large language model architecture that systematically addresses these challenges through three-dimensional optimization: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational enhancement. We design a knowledge transfer pipeline from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for precise medical knowledge retention. Through 4-bit quantization and mixed-precision strategies, we achieve substantial model compression while preserving medical reasoning capabilities. The inference framework incorporates Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching, complemented by specialized prompt templates for diverse medical queries. Experimental evaluation on medical benchmarks demonstrates that our approach maintains 92.1% accuracy on USMLE examinations while reducing memory consumption by 64.7% and inference latency by 12.4% compared to baseline models.

The RU functions as a specialized co-processor that executes symbolic inference, multi-agent coordination, and hybrid symbolic-neural computation as fundamental architectural primitives. This hardware-embedded approach allows autonomous agents to perform goal-directed planning, dynamic knowledge manipulation, and introspective reasoning directly within the computational substrate at system scale. The architecture incorporates a reasoning-specific instruction set architecture, parallel symbolic processing pipelines, agent-aware kernel abstractions, and a unified memory hierarchy that seamlessly integrates cognitive and numerical workloads. Through systematic co-design across hardware, operating system, and agent runtime layers, this architecture establishes a computational foundation where reasoning, learning, and adaptation emerge as intrinsic execution properties rather than software abstractions, potentially enabling the development of general-purpose intelligent machines.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces 'FST.ai' -- which is developed under the 'R3AL.ai' project, which serves as its Principal Investigator: r3al.ai -- a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation, motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and sport-agnostic potential of 'FST.ai' to transform officiating standards across multiple disciplines.</p></details> | 24 pages, 9 figures |

Split learning (SL) addresses this limitation in which it executes part of the inference process on the sensor and off-loads the remainder to a companion device. In the context of constrained devices and the related impact of low-power, over-the-air transport protocols, the performance of split learning remains largely unexplored. TO the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first end-to-end TinyML + SL testbed built on Espressif ESP32-S3 boards, designed to benchmark the over-the-air performance of split learning TinyML in edge/IoT environments. We benchmark the performance of a MobileNetV2 image recognition model, which is quantized to 8-bit integers, partitioned, and delivered to the nodes via over-the-air updates. The intermediate activations are exchanged through different wireless communication methods: ESP-NOW, BLE, and traditional UDP/IP and TCP/IP, enabling a head-to-head comparison on identical hardware. Measurements show that splitting the model after block_16_project_BN layer generates a 5.66 kB tensor that traverses the link in 3.2 ms, when UDP is used, achieving a steady-state round-trip latency of 5.8 s. ESP-NOW presents the most favorable RTT performance 3.7 s; BLE extends battery life further but increases latency beyond 10s.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is uploaded here for research community, thus it is for non-commercial purposes</p></details> |

The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions -- no larger than 10% of the image surface -- even for small 256x256 images.

However, current approaches in this field tend to offer isolated solutions tailored to specific tasks, which can be inefficient and impractical for real-world applications. While some efforts have aimed to unify motion-related tasks, these methods simply use different modalities as conditions to guide motion generation. Consequently, they lack editing capabilities, fine-grained control, and fail to facilitate knowledge sharing across tasks. To address these limitations and provide a versatile, unified framework capable of handling both human motion generation and editing, we introduce a novel paradigm: \textbf{Motion-Condition-Motion}, which enables the unified formulation of diverse tasks with three concepts: source motion, condition, and target motion. Based on this paradigm, we propose a unified framework, \textbf{MotionLab}, which incorporates rectified flows to learn the mapping from source motion to target motion, guided by the specified conditions. In MotionLab, we introduce the 1) MotionFlow Transformer to enhance conditional generation and editing without task-specific modules; 2) Aligned Rotational Position Encoding to guarantee the time synchronization between source motion and target motion; 3) Task Specified Instruction Modulation; and 4) Motion Curriculum Learning for effective multi-task learning and knowledge sharing across tasks. Notably, our MotionLab demonstrates promising generalization capabilities and inference efficiency across multiple benchmarks for human motion.

Threat analysis reports, produced by various individuals and organizations, play a critical role in supporting security operations and combating emerging threats. To enhance the timeliness and automation of threat intelligence sharing, several standards have been established, with the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) framework emerging as one of the most widely adopted. However, generating STIX-compatible data from unstructured security text remains a largely manual, expert-driven process. To address this challenge, we introduce AZERG, a tool designed to assist security analysts in automatically generating structured STIX representations. To achieve this, we adapt general-purpose large language models for the specific task of extracting STIX-formatted threat data. To manage the complexity, the task is divided into four subtasks: entity detection (T1), entity type identification (T2), related pair detection (T3), and relationship type identification (T4). We apply task-specific fine-tuning to accurately extract relevant entities and infer their relationships in accordance with the STIX specification. To address the lack of training data, we compiled a comprehensive dataset with 4,011 entities and 2,075 relationships extracted from 141 full threat analysis reports, all annotated in alignment with the STIX standard. Our models achieved F1-scores of 84.43% for T1, 88.49% for T2, 95.47% for T3, and 84.60% for T4 in real-world scenarios. We validated their performance against a range of open- and closed-parameter models, as well as state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improvements of 2-25% across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted at RAID 2025</p></details> |
| **[DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08005v5)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Adaptive Bayesian Single-Shot Quantum Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16477v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step, and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum sensing agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for publication</p></details> |

Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://rookiexiong7.github.io/projects/SeC/ ; code: https://github.com/OpenIXCLab/SeC ; dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenIXCLab/SeCVOS</p></details> |

Language models are prone to exhibiting biases, further amplifying unfair and harmful stereotypes. Given the fast-growing popularity and wide application of these models, it is necessary to ensure safe and fair language models. As of recent considerable attention has been paid to measuring bias in language models, yet the majority of studies have focused only on English language. A Dutch version of the US-specific CrowS-Pairs dataset for measuring bias in Dutch language models is introduced. The resulting dataset consists of 1463 sentence pairs that cover bias in 9 categories, such as Sexual orientation, Gender and Disability. The sentence pairs are composed of contrasting sentences, where one of the sentences concerns disadvantaged groups and the other advantaged groups. Using the Dutch CrowS-Pairs dataset, we show that various language models, BERTje, RobBERT, multilingual BERT, GEITje and Mistral-7B exhibit substantial bias across the various bias categories. Using the English and French versions of the CrowS-Pairs dataset, bias was evaluated in English (BERT and RoBERTa) and French (FlauBERT and CamemBERT) language models, and it was shown that English models exhibit the most bias, whereas Dutch models the least amount of bias. Additionally, results also indicate that assigning a persona to a language model changes the level of bias it exhibits. These findings highlight the variability of bias across languages and contexts, suggesting that cultural and linguistic factors play a significant role in shaping model biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, accepted at RANLP 2025 data and code here: https://github.com/jerryspan/Dutch-CrowS-Pairs</p></details> |

This article considers corrosion in heat exchangers tubes, where corrosion is typically reported in terms of maximum pit depth per inspected tube, and only a small proportion of tubes are inspected, suggesting extreme value theory (EVT) as suitable methodology. However, in data analysis of heat exchanger data, shallow tube-maxima pits often cannot be considered as extreme; although previous EVT approaches assume all the data are extreme. We overcome this by introducing a threshold - suggesting a block maxima over threshold approach, which leads to more robust inference around model parameters and predicted maximum pit depth.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

In these settings, minimal image overlap prevents reliable correspondence matching, causing traditional methods, such as structure-from-motion (SfM) and multiview stereo (MVS), to fail. This survey reviews the latest advances in neural implicit models (e.g., NeRF and its regularized versions), explicit point-cloud-based approaches (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting), and hybrid frameworks that leverage priors from diffusion and vision foundation models (VFMs).We analyze how geometric regularization, explicit shape modeling, and generative inference are used to mitigate artifacts such as floaters and pose ambiguities in sparse-view settings. Comparative results on standard benchmarks reveal key trade-offs between the reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. Unlike previous reviews, our survey provides a unified perspective on geometry-based, neural implicit, and generative (diffusion-based) methods. We highlight the persistent challenges in domain generalization and pose-free reconstruction and outline future directions for developing 3D-native generative priors and achieving real-time, unconstrained sparse-view reconstruction.</p></details> | 30 pages, 6 figures |

Predicting the accuracy of circuits composed of approximate components without performing complete synthesis remains a challenging problem. Current machine learning approaches used to automate this task require retraining for each new circuit configuration, making them computationally expensive and time-consuming. This paper presents ApproxGNN, a construction methodology for a pre-trained graph neural network model predicting QoR and HW cost of approximate accelerators employing approximate adders from a library. This approach is applicable in DSE for assignment of approximate components to operations in accelerator. Our approach introduces novel component feature extraction based on learned embeddings rather than traditional error metrics, enabling improved transferability to unseen circuits. ApproxGNN models can be trained with a small number of approximate components, supports transfer to multiple prediction tasks, utilizes precomputed embeddings for efficiency, and significantly improves accuracy of the prediction of approximation error. On a set of image convolutional filters, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings improve prediction accuracy (mean square error) by 50% compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the overall prediction accuracy is 30% better than statistical machine learning approaches without fine-tuning and 54% better with fast finetuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICCAD 2025</p></details> |

Recent research proposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to ensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner neuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which are traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization challenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that significantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of inverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box optimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These attacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work, through a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack under more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability between the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a generation-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing an inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and long prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs validates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token long medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1 token matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate four practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion and draw conclusions for future mitigation design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX Security 2025.

However, traditional approaches for solving Helmholtz equation-constrained USCT face three fundamental challenges when integrating these priors: PDE-constrained gradient computation, discretization-induced approximation errors, and computational imbalance between neural networks and numerical PDE solvers. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Diff-ANO} (\textbf{Diff}usion-based Models with \textbf{A}djoint \textbf{N}eural \textbf{O}perators), a novel framework that combines conditional consistency models with adjoint operator learning to address these limitations. Our two key innovations include: (1) a \textit{conditional consistency model} that enables measurement-conditional few-step sampling by directly learning a self-consistent mapping from diffusion trajectories, and (2) an \textit{adjoint operator learning} module that replaces traditional PDE solvers with neural operator surrogates for efficient adjoint-based gradient computation. To enable practical deployment, we introduce the batch-based Convergent Born Series (BCBS)--a memory-efficient strategy for online generation of neural operator training pairs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Diff-ANO significantly improves both computational efficiency and reconstruction quality, especially under sparse-view and partial-view measurement scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Detect Any Sound: Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection with Multi-Modal Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16343v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries. DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the supervised CRNN baseline.

This means that appearance and motion are inherently linked: either both are present and recorded in the event data, or neither is captured. Previous works treat the recovery of these two visual quantities as separate tasks, which does not fit with the above-mentioned nature of event cameras and overlooks the inherent relations between them. We propose an unsupervised learning framework that jointly estimates optical flow (motion) and image intensity (appearance) using a single network. From the data generation model, we newly derive the event-based photometric error as a function of optical flow and image intensity. This error is further combined with the contrast maximization framework to form a comprehensive loss function that provides proper constraints for both flow and intensity estimation. Exhaustive experiments show our method's state-of-the-art performance: in optical flow estimation, it reduces EPE by 20% and AE by 25% compared to unsupervised approaches, while delivering competitive intensity estimation results, particularly in high dynamic range scenarios. Our method also achieves shorter inference time than all other optical flow methods and many of the image reconstruction methods, while they output only one quantity.

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |

We assume a gray-box scenario where an unauthorized user owns a model that is illegally copied from the original model, provides services in a cloud environment, and the user throws images and receives the classification results as a probability distribution of output classes. The framework applies a white-box adversarial attack to align the output probability of a specific class to a designated value. Due to the knowledge of original model, it enables the owner to generate such adversarial examples. We propose a simple but effective adversarial attack method based on the iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by introducing control parameters.

Most existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from input images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and point maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often fails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical applicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly models the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable joint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model designed for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively build a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically invariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to maintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs. By integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling, Dens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface normals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to multi-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that supports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D prediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://g-1nonly.github.io/Dens3R/, Code: https://github.com/G-1nOnly/Dens3R</p></details> |

Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments.

We consider the fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), which models the time evolution of probability densities for systems driven by L\'evy processes, relevant in scenarios where Gaussian assumptions fail. The paper presents an efficient and accurate numerical approach for the free-space FFPE with constant coefficients and Dirac-delta initial conditions. This method utilizes the integral representation of the solutions and enables the efficient handling of very high-dimensional problems using fast algorithms. Our work is the first to present a high-precision numerical solver for the free-space FFPE with Dirac-delta initial conditions. In addition to Dirac-delta initial data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for initial conditions given by sums of Gaussians. This opens the door for future research on more complex scenarios, including those with variable coefficients and other types of initial conditions.</p></details> | 38 pages, 10 figures |

However, existing commercial tactile sensors focus on improving the resolution and sensitivity of single-modal detection with high-cost components and densely integrated design, incurring complex manufacturing processes and unaffordable prices. In this work, we present Bio-Skin, a cost-effective multi-modal tactile sensor that utilizes single-axis Hall-effect sensors for planar normal force measurement and bar-shape piezo resistors for 2D shear force measurement. A thermistor coupling with a heating wire is integrated into a silicone body to achieve temperature sensation and thermostatic function analogous to human skin. We also present a cross-reference framework to validate the two modalities of the force sensing signal, improving the sensing fidelity in a complex electromagnetic environment. Bio-Skin has a multi-layer design, and each layer is manufactured sequentially and subsequently integrated, thereby offering a fast production pathway. After calibration, Bio-Skin demonstrates performance metrics-including signal-to-range ratio, sampling rate, and measurement range-comparable to current commercial products, with one-tenth of the cost. The sensor's real-world performance is evaluated using an Allegro hand in object grasping tasks, while its temperature regulation functionality was assessed in a material detection task.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IROS2025</p></details> |
